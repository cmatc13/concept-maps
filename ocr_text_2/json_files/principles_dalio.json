Whatever success I\u2019ve had in life has had more to do with my knowing how to deal with my not knowing than anything I\nknow. The most important thing I learned is an approach to life based on principles that helps me find out what\u2019s true and what to\ndo about it.\n\nI\u2019m passing along these principles because I am now at the stage in my life in which I want to help others be successful rather\nthan to be more successful myself. Because these principles have helped me and others so much, I want to share them with you. It\u2019s\nup to you to decide how valuable they really are and what, if anything, you want to do with them.\n\nPrinciples are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can\nbe applied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.\n\nEvery day, each of us is faced with a blizzard of situations we must respond to. Without principles we would be forced to react to\nall the things life throws at us individually, as if we were experiencing each of them for the first time. If instead we classify these\nsituations into types and have good principles for dealing with them, we will make better decisions more quickly and have better\nlives as a result. Having a good set of principles is like having a good collection of recipes for success. All successful people operate\n\nby principles that help them be successful, though what they choose to be successful at varies enormously, so their principles vary.\n\f"}, "001224.png": {"text": "To be principled means to consistently operate with principles that can be clearly explained. Unfortunately, most people can\u2019t\ndo that. And it\u2019s very rare for people to write their principles down and share them. That is a shame. I would love to know what\nprinciples guided Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Winston Churchill, Leonardo da Vinci, and others so I could clearly understand what\nthey were going after and how they achieved it and could compare their different approaches. I\u2019d like to know which principles\nare most important to the politicians who want me to vote for them and to all the other people whose decisions affect me. Do we\nhave common principles that bind us together\u2014as a family, as a community, as a nation, as friends across nations? Or do we have\nopposing principles that divide us? What are they? Let\u2019s be specific. This is a time when it is especially important for us to be clear\nabout our principles.\n\nMy hope is that reading this book will prompt you and others to discover your own principles from wherever you think is best\nand ideally write them down. Doing that will allow you and others to be clear about what your principles are and understand each\nother better. It will allow you to refine them as you encounter more experiences and to reflect on them, which will help you make\n\nbetter decisions and be better understood.\n\nHAVING YOUR OWN PRINCIPLES\n\n\u2018We come by our principles in different ways. Sometimes we gain them through our own experiences and reflections. Sometimes\n\u2018we accept them from others, like our parents, or we adopt holistic packages of principles, such as those of religions and legal\nframeworks.\n\nBecause we each have our own goals and our own natures, each of us must choose our own principles to match them. While it\nisn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing to use others\u2019 principles, adopting principles without giving them much thought can expose you to\nthe risk of acting in ways inconsistent with your goals and your nature. At the same time, you, like me, probably don\u2019t know every-\n\nthing you need to know and would be wise to embrace that fact. If you can think for yourself while being open-minded in a clear-\n\f"}, "001225.png": {"text": "headed way to find out what is best for you to do, and if youcan summon up the courage to do it, you will make the most of your\nlife. If you can\u2019t do that, you should reflect on why that is, because that\u2019s most likely your greatest impediment to getting more of\nwhat you want out of life.\n\nThat brings me to my first principle:\n\n* Think for yourself to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light\n\nof #2...\n\n. . and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking available to you. Being clear on your principles is important\nbecause they will affect all aspects of your life, many times a day. For example, when you enter into relationships with others, your\nprinciples and their principles will determine how you interact. People who have shared values and principles get along. People\nwho don\u2019t will suffer through constant misunderstandings and conflicts. Think about the people you are closest to: Are their val-\nues aligned with yours? Do you even know what their values or principles are? Too often in relationships, people\u2019s principles aren\u2019t\nclear. This is especially problematic in organizations where people need to have shared principles to be successful. Being crystal\nclear about my principles is why I labored so much over every sentence in this book.\n\nThe principles you choose can be anything you want them to be as long as they are authentic\u2014i.e., as long as they reflect your\ntrue character and values. You will be faced with millions of choices in life, and the way you make them will reflect the principles\nyou have\u2014so it won't be long before the people around you will be able to tell the principles you are really operating by. The worst\nthing you can be is a phony, because if you're a phony you will lose people\u2019s trust and your own self-respect. So you must be clear\nabout your principles and then you must \u201cwalk the talk.\u201d If inconsistencies seem to exist, you should explain them. It\u2019s best to do\n\nthat in writing because by doing so, you will refine your written principles.\n\f"}, "001226.png": {"text": "While I will be sharing my own principles, I want to make clear to you that I don\u2019t expect you to follow them blindly. On the con-\n\ntrary, I want you to question every word and pick and choose among these principles so you come away with a mix that suits you.\n\nMY PRINCIPLES AND HOW | LEARNED THEM\n\nI learned my principles over a lifetime of making a lot of mistakes and spending a lot of time reflecting on them. Since I was a kid,\nI\u2019ve been a curious, independent thinker who ran after audacious goals. I got excited about visualizing things to go after, had some\npainful failures going after them, learned principles that would prevent me from making the same sort of mistakes again, and\nchanged and improved, which allowed me to imagine and go after even more audacious goals and do that rapidly and repeatedly\nfor a long time. So to me life looks like the sequence you see on the opposite page.\n\nI believe that the key to success lies in knowing how to both strive for a lot and fail well. By failing well, I mean being able to\nexperience painful failures that provide big learnings without failing badly enough to get knocked out of the game.\n\nThis way of learning and improving has been best for me because of what I\u2019m like and because of what I do. I\u2019ve always hada\nbad rote memory and didn\u2019t like following other people\u2019s instructions, but I loved figuring out how things work for myself. I hated\nschool because of my bad memory but when I was twelve I fell in love with trading the markets. To make money in the markets,\none needs to be an independent thinker who bets against the consensus and is right. That\u2019s because the consensus view is baked\ninto the price. One is inevitably going to be painfully wrong a lot, so knowing how to do that well is critical to one\u2019s success. To be\na successful entrepreneur, the same is true: One also has to be an independent thinker who correctly bets against the consensus,\nwhich means being painfully wrong a fair amount. Since I was both an investor and an entrepreneur, I developed a healthy fear of\n\nbeing wrong and figured out an approach to decision making that would maximize my odds of being right.\n\f"}, "001227.png": {"text": " \n   \n \n \n    \n\nMORE AUDACIOUS\nGOALS\n\nAUDACIOUS\n\nFAILURE\nGOALS\nIMPROVING\nLEARNING\nPRINCIPLES\n\n+ Make believability-weighted decisions.\n\nMy painful mistakes shifted me from having a perspective of \u201cI know I\u2019m right\u201d to having one of \u201cHow doI know I\u2019m right?\u201d They\n\ngave me the humility I needed to balance my audacity.

By sharing them with the people at my\ncompany, Bridgewater Associates, and inviting them to help me test my principles in action, I continually refined and evolved\n\nthem. In fact, I was able to refine them to the point that I could see how important it is to:\n\n+ Systemize your decision making.\n\nI discovered I could do that by expressing my decision-making criteria in the form of algorithms that I could embed into our\ncomputers. By running both decision-making systems\u2014i.e., mine in my head and mine in the computer\u2014next to each other, I\nlearned the computer could make better decisions than me because it could process vastly more information than I could, and it\ncould do it faster and unemotionally. Doing that allowed me and the people I worked with to compound our understanding over\ntime and improve the quality of our collective decision making.

The most important thing is that\nyou develop your own principles and ideally write them down, especially if you are working with others.\n\nIt was that approach and the principles it yielded, and not me, that took me from being an ordinary middle-class kid from Long\nIsland to being successful by a number of conventional measures\u2014like starting a company out of my two-bedroom apartment\nand building it into the fifth most important private company in the U.S. (according to Fortune), becoming one of the one hundred\nrichest people in the world (according to Forbes), and being considered one of the one hundred most influential (according to\nTime).

They gave me and Bridgewater\nfar more than I ever dreamed of.\n\nUntil recently, I didn\u2019t want to share these principles outside of Bridgewater because I don\u2019t like public attention and because I\nthought it would be presumptuous to tell others what principles to have. But after Bridgewater successfully anticipated the finan-\ncial crisis of 2008-09, I got a lot of media attention and so did my principles and Bridgewater's unique way of operating.

Since they go so well together, they are combined here in one book prefaced by a\n\nshort autobiography, Where I\u2019m Coming From.\n\nPart I: Where I'm Coming From\n\nIn this part, I share some of the experiences\u2014most importantly, my mistakes\u2014that led me to discover the principles that guide my\ndecision making. To tell you the truth, I still have mixed feelings about telling my personal story, because I worry that it might dis-\ntract you from the principles themselves and from the timeless and universal cause-effect relationships that inform them. For that\nreason, I wouldn't mind if you decided to skip this part of the book. If you do read it, try to look past me and my particular story to\nthe logic and merit of the principles I describe. Think about them, weigh them, and decide how much, if at all, they apply to you\n\nand your own life circumstances\u2014and specifically, whether they can help you achieve your goals, whatever they may be.\n\nPart Il: Life Principles\n\nThe overarching principles that drive my approach to everything are laid out in Life Principles. In this section, I explain my\nprinciples in greater depth and show how they apply in the natural world, in our private lives and relationships, in business and\npolicymaking, and of course at Bridgewater. I\u2019ll share the 5-Step Process I\u2019ve developed for achieving one\u2019s goals and making effec-\ntive choices; I\u2019ll also share some of the insights I\u2019ve gained into psychology and neuroscience and explain how I\u2019ve applied them in\nmy private life and in my business. This is the real heart of the book because it shows how these principles can be applied to most\n\nanything by most anyone.\n\nPart Ill: Work Principles\nIn Work Principles, you'll get a close-up view of the unusual way we operate at Bridgewater.

He was a responsible man dealing with an irresponsible kid. Memories of how we\ninteracted seem funny to me today. For example, one time he told me to cut the grass and I decided to do just the front yard and\npostpone doing the back, but then it rained for a couple of days and the backyard grass became so high I had to cut it with a sickle.\nThat took so long that by the time I was finished, the front yard was too high to mow, and so on.\n\nAfter my mother died, my dad and I became very close, especially when I started my own family. I both liked and loved him. He\nhad a casual, fun way about him the way musicians tend to, and I admired his strong character, which I assume came from living\nthrough the Great Depression and fighting in both World War II and the Korean War. I have memories of him from when he was in\nhis seventies, not hesitating to drive through big snowstorms, shoveling himself out whenever he got stuck like it was no big deal.\nAfter playing in clubs and cutting records for most of his life, he began a second career in his midsixties, teaching music in high\nschool and at a local community college, which he continued until he had a heart attack at eighty-one. He lived another decade\nafter that, as sharp as ever mentally.\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t want to do something, I would fight it, but when I was excited about something, nothing could hold me back.\nFor example, while I resisted doing chores at home, I eagerly did them outside the house to earn money.

It was\nlike nothing I have seen since. One of my earliest memories was of John F.

I learned a lot about commodity futures from\na very interesting classmate, a Vietnam veteran quite a bit older than me. Commodities were attractive because they could be\ntraded with very low margin requirements, meaning I could leverage the limited amount of money I had to invest. If I could make\nwinning decisions, which I planned to do, I could borrow more to make more. Stock, bond, and currency futures didn\u2019t exist back\nthen.

The times we lived in taught us both to question established ways of\ndoing things\u2014an attitude he demonstrated superbly in Apple\u2019s iconic \u201c1984\u201d and \u201cHere's to the Crazy Ones,\u201d which were ad cam-\npaigns that spoke to me.\n\nFor the country as a whole, those were difficult years. As the draft expanded and the numbers of young men coming home in\nbody bags soared, the Vietnam War split the country. There was a lottery based on birthdates to determine the order of those who\nwould be drafted. I remember listening to the lottery on the radio while playing pool with my friends. It was estimated that the\nfirst 160 or so birthdays called would be drafted, though they read off all 366 dates. My birthday was forty-eighth.\n\nI wasn\u2019t smart enough to be afraid of going to war because I naively thought nothing bad could happen to me, but I didn\u2019t want\nto go because I was charging forward with my life and to put it on hold for two years seemed like an eternity. My dad, though, was\n\nadamantly against the war and hell-bent against me going, even though he had believed in and fought in the prior two wars. He\n\f"}, "001243.png": {"text": "had me examined by a doctor who discovered I had hypoglycemia, which gave me an exemption. When I look back on that, I see\nthat I got out of serving on a technicality\u2014that my dad was essentially helping me dodge the draft\u2014which now gives me mixed\nfeelings. I feel guilty I didn\u2019t do my part, relieved I didn\u2019t experience the harmful consequences so many others suffered from the\nwar, and appreciative of my dad for the love behind his effort to protect me. I have no idea what I'd do if I were faced with the same\nsituation today.\n\nAs America\u2019s politics and economy deteriorated, the country\u2019s mood became depressed. The Tet Offensive in January 1968\nseemed to convey the U.S. was losing the war; that same year Lyndon Johnson decided not to run for a second term and Richard\nNixon was elected, beginning an even more difficult era. At the same time, France\u2019s president Charles de Gaulle was turning in his\ncountry\u2019s dollars for gold because he was concerned the U.S. was printing money to finance its spending. Watching the news and\nthe market move together, I began to see the whole picture and understand the cause-effect relationship between the two.\n\nAround 1970 or 1971, I noticed gold was starting to tick up in world markets. Until then, like most people, I hadn't paid much\nattention to currency rates because the currency system had been stable throughout my lifetime. But as currency events increas-\ningly appeared in the news, they caught my attention. I learned that other currencies were fixed against the dollar, that the dollar\nwas fixed against gold, that Americans weren't allowed to own gold (though I wasn\u2019t sure why), and that other central banks could\nconvert their paper dollars into gold, which was how they were assured that they wouldn't be hurt if the U.S. printed too many dol-\nJars. I heard our government officials pooh-pooh the worries about the dollar and the excitement about gold, assuring us that the\ndollar was sound and that gold was just an archaic metal. Speculators were behind the rising gold prices, they said, and they would\nget burned once things settled down. Back then, I still assumed that government officials were honest.\n\nIn the spring of 1971, I graduated college with a nearly perfect grade point average, which got me into Harvard Business School.\nThe summer before I started at HBS, I got a job as a clerk on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. By midsummer, the dollar\nproblem began to reach a breaking point. There were reports that Europeans wouldn't accept dollars from American tourists. The\n\nglobal monetary system was in the process of breaking down, but that wasn\u2019t clear to me quite yet.\n\f"}, "001244.png": {"text": "Then, on Sunday, August 15, 1971, President Nixon went on television to announce that the U.S. would renege on its promise\nto allow dollars to be turned in for gold, which led the dollar to plummet. Since government officials had promised not to devalue\nthe dollar, I listened with amazement as he spoke. Instead of addressing the fundamental problems behind the pressure on the\ndollar, he continued to blame speculators, crafting his words to make it sound like he was moving to support the dollar while his\nactions were doing just the opposite. \u201cFloating it,\u201d as Nixon was doing, and then letting it sink like a stone, looked a lot like a lie to\nme. Over the decades since, I\u2019ve repeatedly seen policymakers deliver such assurances immediately before currency devaluations,\nso I learned not to believe government policymakers when they assure you that they won't let a currency devaluation happen. The\nmore strongly they make those assurances, the more desperate the situation probably is, so the more likely it is that a devaluation\nwill take place.\n\nAs I listened to Nixon speak, I wondered what those developments meant. Money as we\u2019d known it\u2014a claim check to get gold\u2014\nno longer existed. That couldn't be good. It seemed clear to me that the era of promise that Kennedy had personified was unravel-\ning.\n\nMonday morning I walked onto the floor of the exchange expecting pandemonium. There was pandemonium all right, but not\nthe sort I expected: Instead of falling, the stock market jumped about 4 percent, a significant daily gain.\n\nTo try to understand what was happening, I spent the rest of that summer studying past currency devaluations. I learned that\neverything that was going on\u2014the currency breaking its link to gold and devaluing, the stock market soaring in response\u2014had\nhappened before, and that logical cause-effect relationships made those developments inevitable. My failure to anticipate this, I\nrealized, was due to my being surprised by something that hadn\u2019t happened in my lifetime, though it had happened many times\nbefore. The message that reality was conveying to me was \u201cYou better make sense of what happened to other people in other times\nand other places because if you don\u2019t you won\u2019t know if these things can happen to you and, if they do, you won't know how to deal\nwith them.\u201d\n\nEnrolling at Harvard Business School that fall, I was excited about meeting the extraordinarily intelligent people from all over\n\nthe planet who would be my classmates. And high as my expectations were, the experience was even better. I lived with people\n\f"}, "001245.png": {"text": "from all over the world and we partied together in an exciting, eclectic environment. There was no teacher in front of a blackboard\ntelling us what to remember and no tests to see whether we remembered it. Instead we were given actual case studies to read and\nanalyze. Then we gathered in groups to thrash out what we would do if we were in the shoes of the people in those situations. This\nwas my kind of school!\n\nMeanwhile, thanks to the wave of money printing that had followed the demise of the gold standard, the economy and the stock\nmarket were soaring. Stocks were in again in 1972, and the fashion at the time was the Nifty 50. This group of fifty stocks had fast\nand steady earnings growth and were widely believed to be a sure thing.\n\nAs hot as the stock market was, I was more interested in trading commodities, so that spring I begged the director of commodi-\nties at Merrill Lynch to give me a summer job. He was surprised because people from places like Harvard Business School weren't\ntypically interested in commodities, which were considered an obscure stepchild of the Wall Street brokerage industry. Up until\nthen, as far as I know, no Harvard Business School student had ever worked in commodity futures anywhere. Most Wall Street\nfirms didn\u2019t even have commodity futures divisions, and Merrill Lynch\u2019s was small, tucked away on a side street, and furnished\nwith basic metal desks.\n\nA few months later, when I was back for my second year at HBS, the first oil shock began, with prices quadrupling in a matter\nof months. The U.S. economy slowed, commodity prices soared, and in 1973 the stock market took a dive. Once again, I was blind-\nsided\u2014but in retrospect I could see that the dominoes had fallen in a logical sequence.\n\nIn this case, the debt-financed overspending of the 1960s had continued into the early 1970s. The Fed had funded this spending\nwith easy-credit policies, but by paying back its debts with depreciated paper money instead of gold-backed dollars, the U.S. effec-\ntively defaulted. Naturally, with all this money printing the dollar plunged in value. That allowed for more easy credit, which led\nto even more spending. The inflationary surge that followed the breakdown of the currency system sent commodity prices even\nhigher. In response, in 1973, the Fed tightened monetary policy, which is what central banks do when inflation and growth are too\nstrong. This in turn caused the worst decline in stocks and the worst weakening of the economy since the Great Depression. The\n\nNifty 50 were particularly affected, plunging severely.\n\f"}, "001246.png": {"text": "The lesson? When everybody thinks the same thing\u2014such as what a sure bet the Nifty 50 is\u2014it is almost certainly reflected in\nthe price, and betting on it is probably going to be a mistake. I also learned that for every action (such as easy money and credit)\nthere is a consequence (in this case, higher inflation) roughly proportionate to that action, which causes an approximately equal\nand opposite reaction (tightening of money and credit) and market reversals.\n\nI was beginning to see things happening over and over again, which led me to see that most everything is \u201canother one of\nthose\u201d: Most everything has happened repeatedly before for logical cause-effect reasons. Of course, being able to both properly\nidentify which ones of those are happening and to understand the cause-effect relationships behind them remained difficult.\nThough most everything seemed inevitable and logical in retrospect, nothing was nearly as clear in real time.\n\nBecause people chase what\u2019s hot and avoid what\u2019s not, stock investing fell out of favor after 1973 and commodity trading\nbecame the thing to do. With my background in commodities and my Harvard MBA, I became a sought-after property. Dominick\n& Dominick, a middle-sized, hundred-year-old brokerage firm, hired me as director of commodities for $25,000 a year, which was\nnear the top of what HBS graduate starting salaries were that year. My new boss paired me with an older, experienced guy who had\nlots of commodities brokerage experience, and we were assigned the task of setting up a commodities division. I was in way over\nmy head, though I was too arrogant to realize it at the time. I probably would have learned a lot of painful lessons had the job con-\ntinued, but the bad stock market took Dominick & Dominick under before we\u2019d made much progress.\n\nAs the economy unraveled, the Watergate scandal dominated the headlines and I saw again how politics and economics inter-\ntwine, usually with economics leading. This downward spiral led people to become pessimistic, so they sold their stocks and the\nmarket continued to fall. Things couldn\u2019t have gotten much worse but everyone was afraid they would. It was the mirror image of\nwhat I'd witnessed in 1966 when the market hit its top, and just as it was then, the consensus was wrong. When people are very\npessimistic, they sell out, prices typically get very cheap, and action to improve conditions has to be taken. Sure enough, the Fed\neased its monetary policy and stocks hit bottom in December 1974.\n\nAt the time, I was single and living in New York; I was having a great time partying with friends from HBS and dating a lot.\n\nMy roommate was dating a Cuban woman and he set me up on a blind date with one of her friends, an exotic woman from Spain\n\f"}, "001247.png": {"text": "named Barbara who could barely speak English. This wasn\u2019t a problem, because we communicated in different ways. She thrilled\nme for nearly two years before we moved in together, got married, had four sons, and shared an amazing life together. She still\nthrills me but is too private a person for me to say more about her.\n\nWhile I worked in the brokerage business, I also traded my own account. Though I had many more winning positions than\nlosing ones, I can only recall the losing ones now. I remember one big one when I owned pork bellies. For several days the market\nfor them was limit down\u2014meaning that the price had fallen so low that trading had to be stopped. I later described the impact of\nthis experience to Jack Schwager, the author of Hedge Fund Market Wizards:\n\nIn those days, we had the big commodity boards, which clicked whenever prices changed. So each morning, on the opening, I would\nsee and hear the market click down 200 points, the daily limit, stay unchanged at that price, and know that I had lost that much\nmore, with the amount of potential additional losses still undefined. It was a very tactile experience . . . and] it taught me the\nimportance of risk controls, because I never wanted to experience that pain again. It enhanced my fear of being wrong and taught\nme to make sure that no single bet, or even multiple bets, could cause me to lose more than an acceptable amount. In trading you\nhave to be defensive and aggressive at the same time. If you are not aggressive, you are not going to make money, and if you are not\ndefensive, you are not going to keep money. I believe that anyone who has made money in trading has had to experience horrendous\npain at some point. Trading is like working with electricity; you can get an electric shock. With that pork belly trade and other\n\ntrades, I felt the electric shock and the fear that comes with it.\n\nAfter Dominick & Dominick closed its retail business, I moved on to a bigger, more successful brokerage firm. During my short\nstay there, it took over numerous other firms and changed its name several times, eventually becoming Shearson, though Sandy\nWeill stayed in charge through it all.\n\nShearson put me in charge of its futures hedging business, which included both commodity futures and financial futures. I was\n\nthe person helping clients who had price risks in their businesses manage them by using futures. I developed quite an expertise\n\f"}, "001248.png": {"text": "in the grain and livestock markets, which often led me down to West Texas and the agricultural areas of California. The Shearson\nbrokers, cattle producers, and grain dealers I dealt with were great folks who brought me into their worlds, taking me to honky-\ntonks, dove hunts, and barbecues. We worked and had a blast together, and I built a second life with them that lasted several years\n\u2014though my job at Shearson lasted only a bit more than a year.\n\nMuch as! loved the job and the people I worked with, I didn\u2019t fit into the Shearson organization. I was too wild. For example, as a\njoke that now seems pretty stupid, I hired a stripper to drop her cloak while I was lecturing at a whiteboard at the California Grain\n& Feed Association\u2019s annual convention. I also punched my boss in the face. Not surprisingly, I was fired.\n\nBut the brokers, their clients, and even the ones who fired me liked me and wanted to keep getting my advice. Even better, they\n\nwere willing to pay me for it, so in 1975 I started Bridgewater Associates.\n\nSTARTING BRIDGEWATER\n\nActually, I restarted it. Just after I graduated from HBS and went to work in commodities at Dominick & Dominick, I\u2019d set up a little\nbusiness with Bob Scott, a friend from HBS. Along with a few pals in other countries, we made halfhearted attempts to sell com-\nmodities from the U.S. to other countries. We called it Bridgewater because we were \u201cbridging the waters\u201d and it had a good ring to\nit. By 1975 there wasn\u2019t much left of this commodities company, but as it did already exist on paper, I used it.\n\nI worked out of my two-bedroom apartment. When a pal from HBS who I shared the apartment with moved out, I made his\nbedroom an office. I worked with another friend I played rugby with, and we hired a great young woman who worked as our assis-\ntant. That was Bridgewater.\n\nIspent most of my time following the markets and putting myself in the shoes of my corporate clients to show them how 1\n\nwould handle market risks if I were them.

We moved into a rented brownstone in Manhattan and I\nmoved the company there too.

We arrived in Moscow on New Year\u2019s Eve and rode by bus from the drab airport\nthrough a dusting of snow, past St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral to a big party with a lot of incredibly friendly, fun-loving Russians.\n\nMy business has always been a way to get me into exotic places and allow me to meet interesting people. If I make any money\n\nfrom those trips, that\u2019s just icing on the cake.\n\nMODELING MARKETS AS MACHINES\n\nI was really getting my head into the livestock, meat, grain, and oilseed markets. I loved them because they were concrete and less\nsubject than stocks to distorted perceptions of value. While stocks could stay too high or too low because \u201cgreater fools\u201d kept buy-\ning or selling them, livestock ended up on the meat counter where it would be priced based on what consumers were willing to pay.\nI could visualize the processes that led to those sales and see the relationships underlying them. Since livestock eat grain (mostly\ncorn) and soymeal, and since corn and soybeans compete for acreage, those markets are closely related. I learned just about ev-\nerything imaginable about them\u2014what the planted acreage and typical yields were in each of the major growing areas; how to\nconvert rainfall levels in different weeks of the growing season into yield estimates; how to project harvest sizes, carrying costs,\nand livestock inventories by weight group, location, and rates of weight gain; and how to project dressing yields, retailer margins,\nconsumer preferences by cut of meat, and the amounts to be slaughtered in each season.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t academic learning: People with practice in the business showed me how the agricultural processes worked, and I\n\norganized what they told me into models I used to map the interactions of those parts through time.\n\f"}, "001250.png": {"text": "For example, by knowing how many cattle, chickens, and hogs were being fed, how much grain they ate, and how fast they\ngained weight, I could project both when and how much meat would come to market and when and how much corn and soymeal\nwould be consumed. Likewise, by seeing how much acreage was planted with corn and soybeans in all the growing areas, doing\nregressions that showed how rainfall affected the yields in each of these areas, and applying weather forecasts and rainfall data,\n\nI could project the timing and quantity of corn and soybean production. To me it all looked like a beautiful machine with logical\ncause-effect relationships. By understanding these relationships, I could come up with decision rules (or principles) I could model.\n\nThese early models were a far cry from the ones we use now; they were back-of-the-envelope sketches, analyzed and converted\ninto computer programs with the technology I could afford at the time. At the very beginning, I did regressions on my handheld\nHewlett-Packard HP-67 calculator, plotted charts by hand with colored pencils, and recorded every trade in composition note-\nbooks. When the personal computer came along, I could input the numbers and watch them be converted into pictures of what\nwould happen on spreadsheets. Knowing how cattle, hogs, and chickens progressed through their stages of production, how they\ncompeted for meat-eater dollars, what meat-eaters would spend and why, and how the profit margins of meatpackers and retailers\nwould influence their behaviors (for example, which cuts of meat they would push in advertisements), I could see how the ma-\nchine produced cattle, hog, and chicken prices that I could bet on.\n\nAs basic as those early models were, I loved building and refining them\u2014and they were good enough to make me money. The\napproach to price determination I was using was different from the one I had learned in my economics classes where supply and\ndemand were both measured in terms of quantities sold. I found it much more practical to measure demand as the amount spent\n(instead of as the quantity bought) and to look at who the buyers and sellers were and why they bought and sold. I will explain this\napproach in Economic and Investment Principles.\n\nThis different approach was one of the key reasons I caught economic and market moves others missed. From that point on,\nwhenever I looked at any market\u2014commodities, stocks, bonds, currencies, whatever\u2014I could see and understand imbalances that\n\nothers who defined supply and demand in the traditional way (as units that equaled each other) missed.\n\f"}, "001251.png": {"text": "Visualizing complex systems as machines, figuring out the cause-effect relationships within them, writing down the principles\nfor dealing with them, and feeding them into a computer so the computer could \u201cmake decisions\u201d for me all became standard\npractices.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. My approach was far from perfect. I vividly remember one \u201ccan\u2019t lose\u201d bet that personally cost me about\n$100,000. That was most of my net worth at the time. More painful still, it hurt my clients too. The most painful lesson that was\nrepeatedly hammered home is that you can never be sure of anything: There are always risks out there that can hurt you badly,\neven in the seemingly safest bets, so it\u2019s always best to assume you're missing something. This lesson changed my approach to de-\ncision making in ways that will reverberate throughout this book\u2014and to which I attribute much of my success. But I would make\n\nmany other mistakes before I fully changed my behavior.\n\nBUILDING THE BUSINESS\n\nWhile making money was good, having meaningful work and meaningful relationships was far better. To me, meaningful work is\nbeing on a mission I become engrossed in, and meaningful relationships are those I have with people I care deeply about and who\ncare deeply about me.\n\nThink about it: It\u2019s senseless to have making money as your goal as money has no intrinsic value\u2014its value comes from what it\ncan buy, and it can\u2019t buy everything. It\u2019s smarter to start with what you really want, which are your real goals, and then work back\nto what you need to attain them. Money will be one of the things you need, but it\u2019s not the only one and certainly not the most im-\nportant one once you get past having the amount you need to get what you really want.\n\nWhen thinking about the things you really want, it pays to think of their relative values so you weigh them properly. In my\ncase, I wanted meaningful work and meaningful relationships equally, and I valued money less\u2014as long as I had enough to take\n\ncare of my basic needs. In thinking about the relative importance of great relationships and money, it was clear that relationships\n\f"}, "001252.png": {"text": "were more important because there is no amount of money I would take in exchange for a meaningful relationship, because there\nis nothing I could buy with that money that would be more valuable. So, for me, meaningful work and meaningful relationships\nwere and still are my primary goals and everything I did was for them. Making money was an incidental consequence of that.\n\nIn the late 1970s, I began sending my observations about the markets to clients via telex. The genesis of these Daily Observations\n(\u201cGrains and Oilseeds,\u201d \u201cLivestock and Meats,\u201d \u201cEconomy and Financial Markets\u201d) was pretty simple: While our primary busi-\nness was in managing risk exposures, our clients also called to pick my brain about the markets. Taking those calls became time-\nconsuming, so I decided it would be more efficient to write down my thoughts every day so others could understand my logic\nand help improve it. It was a good discipline since it forced me to research and reflect every day. It also became a key channel of\ncommunication for our business. Today, almost forty years and ten thousand publications later, our Daily Observations are read,\nreflected on, and argued about by clients and policymakers around the world. I\u2019m still writing them, along with others at Bridge-\n\u2018water, and expect to continue to write them until people don\u2019t care to read them or I die.\n\nIn addition to providing clients with these observations and advice, I began to manage their exposures by buying and selling\non their behalf. Sometimes I was paid a fixed fee each month and sometimes I received a percentage of the profits. Among my\nconsulting clients during this period was McDonald\u2019s, which was a huge beef buyer, and Lane Processing, then the largest chicken\nproducer in the country. I made them both a lot of money\u2014especially Lane Processing, which did even better from its speculations\nin the grain and soy markets than it did from raising and selling chickens.\n\nAround this time, McDonald\u2019s had conceived of a new product, the Chicken McNugget, but they were reluctant to bring it to\nmarket because of their concern that chicken prices might rise and squeeze their profit margins. Chicken producers like Lane\nwouldn't agree to sell to them at a fixed price because they were worried that their costs would go up and they would be squeezed.\n\nAs I thought about the problem, it occurred to me that in economic terms a chicken can be seen as a simple machine consisting\nof a chick plus its feed. The most volatile cost that the chicken producer needed to worry about was feed prices. I showed Lane how\nto use a mix of corn and soymeal futures to lock in costs so they could quote a fixed price to McDonald\u2019s. Having greatly reduced its\n\nprice risk, McDonald\u2019s introduced the McNugget in 1983. I felt great about helping make that happen.\n\f"}, "001253.png": {"text": "lidentified similar types of price relationships in the cattle and meat markets. For example, I showed cattle feeders how they\ncould lock in strong profit margins by hedging good price relationships between their cost items (feeder cattle, corn, and soymeal)\nand what they were going to sell (fed cattle) six months later. I developed a way of selling different cuts of fresh meat for future\ndelivery at fixed prices far below frozen meat prices but that still produced big profit margins. Combining my clients\u2019 deep under-\nstanding of the way the \u201cmachines\u201d of their own businesses operated with my knowledge of the way markets functioned worked\nto our mutual advantage, while making the markets more efficient overall.

In the 1970s, there were three such waves. The first\ncame in 1971, as a result of the dollar\u2019s devaluation. The second, which came between 1974 and 1975, took inflation to its highest\nlevel since World War II. The Fed tightened the money supply, driving interest rates to record highs, which caused the worst stock\nmarket and economic downturn since the 1930s. The third and largest wave came in 1979-82 and was one of the greatest eco-\nnomic/market crescendos and reversals since 1929-32. Interest rates and inflation soared and crashed; stocks, bonds, commodi-\nties, and currencies went through one of their most volatile periods ever; and unemployment hit its highest level since the Great\nDepression. It was a time of extreme turbulence for the global economy, for the markets, and for me personally.\n\nIn 1978-80 (as in 1970-71 and in 1974-75) different markets began to move in unison because they were more influenced by\nswings in money and credit growth than by changes in their individual supply-demand balances. These big moves were exacer-\nbated by the oil shock that followed the fall of the Shah of Iran. That oil market volatility led to the creation of the first oil futures\ncontract, which gave me trading opportunities (by then, there were futures markets in interest rates and currencies as well, and1\n\nwas making bets in all of them).\n\f"}, "001255.png": {"text": "Because all markets were being driven by these factors, I immersed myself in macroeconomics and historical data (especially\ninterest rates and currency data) to improve my understanding of the machine at play.

By July 1979, inflation was clearly out of control, and President Jimmy\nCarter appointed Paul Volcker chairman of the Federal Reserve. A few months later, Volcker announced that the Fed would limit\nthe growth of the money supply to 5.5 percent. According to my calculations at the time, 5.5 percent money growth would break\n\nthe inflation spiral\u2014but it would also strangle the economy and markets and likely cause a catastrophic debt crisis.\n\nA SILVER ROLLER COASTER\n\nJust before Thanksgiving, I met with Bunker Hunt, then the richest man in the world, at the Petroleum Club in Dallas.

Just a few weeks before our meeting, Iranian militants had\nstormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran, taking fifty-two Americans hostage. There were long lines to buy gas and extreme market\nvolatility.

He\u2019d been wanting to get his wealth out of paper\nmoney for the past few years, so he\u2019d been buying commodities, especially silver, which he had started purchasing for about $1.29\nper ounce, as a hedge against inflation. He kept buying and buying as inflation and the price of silver went up, until he had essen-\ntially cornered the silver market. At that point, silver was trading at around $10. I told him I thought it might be a good time to get\nout because the Fed was becoming tight enough to raise short-term interest rates above long-term rates (which was called \u201cinvert-\ning the yield curve\u201d). Every time that happened, inflation-hedged assets and the economy went down. But Bunker was in the oil\n\nbusiness, and the Middle East oil producers he talked to were still worried about the depreciation of the dollar. They had told him\n\f"}, "001256.png": {"text": "they were also going to buy silver as a hedge against inflation so he held on to it in the expectation that its price would continue to\nrise. I got out.\n\nOn December 8, 1979, Barbara and I had our second son, Paul. Everything was changing very fast, but I loved the intensity of it\nall.\n\nBy early 1980, silver had gone to nearly $50, and as rich as he was, Bunker became a lot richer. While I had made a lot of money\non silver\u2019s rise to $10, I was kicking myself for missing the ride to $50. But at least, by being out, I didn\u2019t lose money. There are anx-\nious times in every investor\u2019s career when your expectations of what should be happening aren't aligned with what is happening\nand you don\u2019t know if you're looking at great opportunities or catastrophic mistakes. Because I had a strong tendency to be right\nbut early, I was inclined to think that was the case. It was, but to have missed the $40 move up was inexcusable to me.\n\nWhen the plunge finally did happen, in March 1980, silver crashed back down below $11. It ruined Hunt, and he nearly brought\ndown the whole U.S. economy as he fell.2 The Fed had to intervene to control the ripple effects. All of this pounded an indelible\nlesson into my head: Timing is everything. I was relieved that I was out of that market, but watching the richest man in the world\n\n\u2014who was also someone I empathized with\u2014go broke was jarring. Yet it was nothing compared to what was to come.\n\nEXPANDING THE TEAM\n\nLater that same year, a great guy named Paul Colman joined Bridgewater. We had become good friends from our dealings in the\ncattle and beef industry, and I respected his intellect and values, so I convinced him we should conquer that world together. He\nbrought his wonderful wife and kids up from Guymon, Oklahoma, and our families became inseparable. We ran the business in\na scrappy, seat-of-the-pants way. Because the office part of the brownstone where I lived and worked was generally such a mess\n\u2014with chicken bones or other scraps from working through the previous night\u2019s dinner littering my desk\u2014we held all our client\n\nmeetings at the Harvard Club. Paul would hide a clean blue oxford shirt and tie amid the mess so I\u2019d have something to wear. In\n\f"}, "001257.png": {"text": "1981, we decided we wanted to raise our families in more of a country setting, so we all moved up to Wilton, Connecticut, to run\nBridgewater from there.\n\nColman and I worked by challenging each other\u2019s ideas and trying to find the best answers; it was a constant back-and-forth,\nwhich we both enjoyed, especially at a time when there was so much to figure out. We would debate about the markets and the\n\nforces behind them late into the night, plug data into the computer before we went to bed, and see what it spit out in the morning.\n\nMY BIG DEPRESSION CALL\n\nThe economy was in even worse shape in 1979-81 than it was during the financial crisis of 2007-08 and the markets were more\nvolatile. In fact, some would say this was the most volatile period ever. The charts opposite going back to 1940 show the volatility\nof interest rates and gold.\n\nAs you can see, there had been nothing like it prior to 1979-82. It was one of the most pivotal times in the last hundred years.\nThe political pendulum throughout the world swung to the right, bringing Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and Helmut Kohl to\npower. \u201cLiberal\u201d had ceased to mean being in favor of progress and had come to mean \u201cpaying people not to work.\u201d\n\nAs I saw it, the Fed was stuck between a rock and a hard place. They either had to a) print money to relieve debt problems and\nkeep the economy going (which had already pushed inflation to 10 percent in 1981 and was causing people to dump bonds and\nbuy inflation-hedged assets), or b) break the back of inflation by becoming bone-crushingly tight (which would break the back of\ndebtors because debt was at the highest levels since the Great Depression). The worsening problem showed up in both progres-\nsively higher levels of inflation and progressively worse levels of economic activity. Both appeared to be coming to a head. Debts\ncontinued to rise much faster than the incomes borrowers needed to repay them, and American banks were lending huge amounts\n\n\u2014much more than they had in capital\u2014to emerging countries. In March 1981, I wrote a Daily Observation entitled \u201cThe Next De-\n\f"}, "001258.png": {"text": "pression in Perspective\u201d and concluded it by saying, \u201cThe enormity of our debt implies that the depression will be as bad or worse\n\nthan that witnessed in the thirties.\u201d\n\nT-BILL RATE\n\noo nn\n\n10 YR BOND YIELD\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGOLD PRICE\n\nThis view was extremely controversial. To most people, \u201cdepression\u201d was a scary word used by kooky and sensationalist people,\nnot something thoughtful people took seriously. But I had studied debt and depressions back to 1800, done my calculations, and\nwas confident that the debt crisis led by emerging countries was coming. I had to share my thinking with my clients. Because my\nviews were so controversial I asked others to track my reasoning and point out to me where it was bad. No one could find any flaws\n\nin my logic, though they were all reluctant to endorse my conclusion.\n\f"}, "001259.png": {"text": "Because I believed that the choice was between accelerating inflation and deflationary depression, I was holding both gold\n(which performs well in accelerating inflation) and bonds (which perform well in deflationary depressions). Up until that point,\ngold and bonds had moved in opposite directions, depending on whether inflation expectations rose or fell. Holding those posi-\ntions seemed much safer than holding alternatives like cash, which would lose value in an inflation environment, or stocks, which\nwould crash in a depression.\n\nAt first, the markets went against me. But my experience with silver and other trades had taught me that I had a chronic\nproblem with timing, so I believed I was just early and what I was expecting would happen soon. That didn\u2019t take long to happen.\nBy the fall of 1981, the tight Fed policies were having a devastating effect, my bond bets were beginning to pay off, and my kooky\nviews were starting to look right on. In February 1982, the Fed temporarily added liquidity to avoid a cash crunch. In June, as the\nscramble for liquidity intensified, the Fed responded by printing money, increasing liquidity to its highest level since Paul Volcker\u2019s\n\nappointment. But it still wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nTHE GREATEST WHIPSAW EVER\n\nIn August 1982, Mexico defaulted on its debt. By then, it was clear to most everyone that a number of other countries were about\nto follow. This was a huge deal, because U.S. banks had lent about 250 percent of their capital to other countries just as at risk as\nMexico. Business loan activity in the U.S. ground to a halt.\n\nBecause I was one of the few people who had seen these things coming, I started to get a lot of attention. Congress was holding\nhearings on the crisis and invited me to testify; in November I was the featured guest on Wall $treet Week with Louis Rukeyser, the\nmust-watch show for anyone in the markets. In both appearances, I confidently declared that we were headed for depression and\n\nexplained why.\n\f"}, "001260.png": {"text": "After Mexico\u2019s default, the Fed responded to the economic collapse and debt defaults by making money more readily available.\nThis caused the stock market to jump by a record amount. While that surprised me, I interpreted it as a knee-jerk reaction to the\nFed\u2019s move. After all, in 1929 a 15 percent rally was followed by the greatest crash of all time. In October, I laid out my prognosis\nin amemo. As I saw it, there was a 75 percent chance the Fed\u2019s efforts would fall short and the economy would move into failure;\n\na 20 percent chance it would initially succeed at stimulating the economy but still ultimately fail; and a 5 percent chance it would\nprovide enough stimulus to save the economy but trigger hyperinflation. To hedge against the worst possibilities, I bought gold\nand T-bill futures as a spread against eurodollars, which was a limited-risk way of betting on credit problems increasing.\n\nIwas dead wrong. After a delay, the economy responded to the Fed\u2019s efforts, rebounding in a noninflationary way. In other\nwords, inflation fell while growth accelerated. The stock market began a big bull run, and over the next eighteen years the U.S.\neconomy enjoyed the greatest noninflationary growth period in its history.\n\nHow was that possible? Eventually, I figured it out. As money poured out of these borrower countries and into the U.S., it\nchanged everything. It drove the dollar up, which produced deflationary pressures in the U.S., which allowed the Fed to ease inter-\nest rates without raising inflation. This fueled a boom. The banks were protected both because the Federal Reserve loaned them\ncash and the creditors\u2019 committees and international financial restructuring organizations such as the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) and the Bank for International Settlements arranged things so that the debtor nations could pay their debt service\nfrom new loans. That way everyone could pretend everything was fine and write down those loans over many years.\n\nMy experience over this period was like a series of blows to the head with a baseball bat. Being so wrong\u2014and especially so\npublicly wrong\u2014was incredibly humbling and cost me just about everything I had built at Bridgewater. I saw that I had been an ar-\nrogant jerk who was totally confident in a totally incorrect view.\n\nSo there I was after eight years in business, with nothing to show for it. Though I\u2019d been right much more than I'd been wrong, I\n\nwas all the way back to square one.\n\f"}, "001261.png": {"text": "At one point, I\u2019d lost so much money I couldn\u2019t afford to pay the people who worked with me. One by one, I had to let them go.\n\u2018We went down to two employees\u2014Colman and me. Then Colman had to go. With tears from all, his family packed up and returned\nto Oklahoma. Bridgewater was now down to just one employee: me.\n\nLosing people I cared so much about and very nearly losing my dream of working for myself was devastating. To make ends\nmeet, I even had to borrow $4,000 from my dad until we could sell our second car. I had come to a fork in the road: Should I put ona\ntie and take a job on Wall Street? That was not the life I wanted. On the other hand, I had a wife and two young children to support.\n\nI realized I was facing one of life\u2019s big turning points and my choices would have big implications for me and for my family\u2019s future.\n\nFINDING A WAY PAST MY INTRACTABLE INVESTMENT PROBLEM\n\nMaking money in the markets is tough. The brilliant trader and investor Bernard Baruch put it well when he said, \u201cIf you are ready\nto give up everything else and study the whole history and background of the market and all principal companies whose stocks are\non the board as carefully as a medical student studies anatomy\u2014if you can do all that and in addition you have the cool nerves of a\ngambler, the sixth sense of a clairvoyant and the courage of a lion, you have a ghost of a chance.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, the mistakes that led to my crash seemed embarrassingly obvious. First, I had been wildly overconfident and had\nlet my emotions get the better of me. I learned (again) that no matter how much I knew and how hard I worked, I could never be\ncertain enough to proclaim things like what I'd said on Wall $treet Week: \u201cThere'll be no soft landing. I can say that with absolute\ncertainty, because I know how markets work.\u201d I am still shocked and embarrassed by how arrogant I was.\n\nSecond, I again saw the value of studying history. What had happened, after all, was \u201canother one of those.\u201d I should have\nrealized that debts denominated in one\u2019s own currency can be successfully restructured with the government\u2019s help, and that\nwhen central banks simultaneously provide stimulus (as they did in March 1932, at the low point of the Great Depression, and as\n\nthey did again in 1982), inflation and deflation can be balanced against each other. As in 1971, I had failed to recognize the lessons\n\f"}, "001262.png": {"text": "of history. Realizing that led me to try to make sense of all movements in all major economies and markets going back a hundred\nyears and to come up with carefully tested decision-making principles that are timeless and universal.\n\nThird, I was reminded of how difficult it is to time markets. My long-term estimates of equilibrium levels were not reliable\nenough to bet on; too many things could happen between the time I placed my bets and the time (if ever) that my estimates were\nreached.\n\nStaring at these failings, I realized that if I was going to move forward without a high likelihood of getting whacked again, I\nwould have to look at myself objectively and change\u2014starting by learning a better way of handling the natural aggressiveness I\u2019ve\nalways shown in going after what I wanted.\n\nImagine that in order to have a great life you have to cross a dangerous jungle. You can stay safe where you are and have an or-\ndinary life, or you can risk crossing the jungle to have a terrific life. How would you approach that choice? Take a moment to think\nabout it because it is the sort of choice that, in one form or another, we all have to make.\n\nEven after my crash, I knew I had to go after the terrific life with all its risks, so the question was how to \u201ccross the dangerous\njungle\u201d without getting killed. In retrospect, my crash was one of the best things that ever happened to me because it gave me the\nhumility I needed to balance my aggressiveness. I learned a great fear of being wrong that shifted my mind-set from thinking \u201cI\u2019m\nright\u201d to asking myself \u201cHow do I know I\u2019m right?\u201d And I saw clearly that the best way to answer this question is by finding other\nindependent thinkers who are on the same mission as me and who see things differently from me. By engaging them in thoughtful\ndisagreement, I\u2019d be able to understand their reasoning and have them stress-test mine. That way, we can all raise our probability\nof being right.\n\nIn other words, I just want to be right\u2014I don\u2019t care if the right answer comes from me. So I learned to be radically open-minded\n\nto allow others to point out what I might be missing. I saw that the only way I could succeed would be to:\n\n1. Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning.\n\n2. Know when not to have an opinion.\n\f"}, "001263.png": {"text": "3. Develop, test, and systemize timeless and universal principles.\n\n4, Balance risks in ways that keep the big upside while reducing the downside.\n\nDoing these things significantly improved my returns relative to my risks, and the same principles apply in other aspects of life.\nMost importantly, this experience led me to build Bridgewater as an idea meritocracy\u2014not an autocracy in which I lead and others\n\nfollow, and not a democracy in which everyone\u2019s vote is equal\u2014but a meritocracy that encourages thoughtful disagreements and\n\nexplores and weighs people\u2019s opi\n\n \n\nions in proportion to their merits.\n\nBringing these opposing opinions into the open and exploring them taught me a lot about how people think. I came to see that\npeople\u2019s greatest weaknesses are the flip sides of their greatest strengths. For example, some people are prone to take on too much\nrisk while others are too risk averse; some are too focused on the details while others are too big-picture. Most are too much one\nway and not enough another. Typically, by doing what comes naturally to us, we fail to account for our weaknesses, which leads\nus to crash. What happens after we crash is most important. Successful people change in ways that allow them to continue to take\nadvantage of their strengths while compensating for their weaknesses and unsuccessful people don't. Later in the book I will de-\nscribe specific strategies for change, but the important thing to note here is that beneficial change begins when you can acknowl-\nedge and even embrace your weaknesses.\n\nOver the years that followed, I found that most of the extraordinarily successful people I\u2019ve met had similar big painful failures\nthat taught them the lessons that ultimately helped them succeed. Looking back on getting fired from Apple in 1985, Steve Jobs\nsaid, \u201cIt was awful-tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don\u2019t lose\nfaith.

You will think you have failed\u2014but that won\u2019t be true unless you give up.

At first, it\nseemed to me that I faced an all-or-nothing choice: I could either take on a lot of risk in pursuit of high returns (and occasionally\nfind myself ruined) or I could lower my risk and settle for lower returns. But I needed to have both low risk and high returns, and\nby setting out on a mission to discover how I could, I learned to go slowly when faced with the choice between two things that you\nneed that are seemingly at odds. That way you can figure out how to have as much of both as possible. There is almost always a\ngood path that you just haven't discovered yet, so look for it until you find it rather than settle for the choice that is then apparent\nto you.\n\nAs difficult as this was, I eventually found a way to have my cake and eat it too.

Still, I gradually added clients,\nrevenue, and a new team. With time, my upswings increased in magnitude and my downswings were both tolerable and educa-\ntional.

If it was currently 60 cents, I'd know I wanted to buy it, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to predict that the price would drop to\n50 cents before climbing back to 75, and I wouldn\u2019t know when to buy and sell. Rarely, but still too often, the system would be dead\nwrong and I would lose a lot.\n\n\u201cHe who lives by the crystal ball is destined to eat ground glass\u201d is a saying I quoted a lot in those days.

In order to do that, I would have to have a vast store of economic and\nmarket data to draw on\u2014and as it happened, I did.\n\nFrom very early on, whenever I took a position in the markets, I wrote down the criteria I used to make my decision. Then, when\nIclosed out a trade, I could reflect on how well these criteria had worked. It occurred to me that if 1 wrote those criteria into for-\nmulas (now more fashionably called algorithms) and then ran historical data through them, I could test how well my rules would\nhave worked in the past. Here\u2019s how it worked in practice: I would start out with my intuitions as I always did, but I would express\nthem logically, as decision-making criteria, and capture them in a systematic way, creating a mental map of what I would do in\neach particular situation. Then I would run historical data through the systems to see how my decision would have performed in\nthe past and, depending upon the results, modify the decision rules appropriately.\n\nWe tested the systems going as far back as we could, typically more than a century, in every country for which we had data,\nwhich gave me great perspective on how the economic/market machine worked through time and how to bet on it. Doing this\nhelped educate me and led me to refine my criteria so they were timeless and universal.

However, rather than blindly following the computer\u2019s recommendations, I would have the computer\nwork in parallel with my own analysis and then compare the two. When the computer\u2019s decision was different from mine, I would\nexamine why. Most of the time, it was because I had overlooked something. In those cases, the computer taught me. But sometimes\nI would think about some new criteria my system would\u2019ve missed, so I would then teach the computer. We helped each other. It\ndidn\u2019t take long before the computer, with its tremendous processing power, was much more effective than me. This was great,\nbecause it was like having a chess grandmaster helping me plot my moves, except this player operated according to a set of criteria\nthat I understood and believed were logical, so there was no reason for us to ever fundamentally disagree.\n\nThe computer was much better than my brain in \u201cthinking\u201d about many things at once, and it could do it more precisely, more\nrapidly, and less emotionally. And, because it had such a great memory, it could do a better job of compounding my knowledge and\nthe knowledge of the people I worked with as Bridgewater grew. Rather than argue about our conclusions, my partners and I would\nargue about our different decision-making criteria. Then we resolved our disagreements by testing the criteria objectively. The\nrapidly expanding power of computers during that era was like a constant stream of gifts from the gods to us.

Up until then, I hadn\u2019t done any marketing; the business we got came from word\n\nof mouth and from people reading my daily telexes and seeing my public appearances. But clearly there was a growing demand\nfor our research, and I realized we could sell it to supplement our consulting and trading income. So I hired a seventh employee, a\nformer door-to-door Bible salesman named Rob Fried, and we hit the road, lugging around a projector and a huge stack of slides,\nhawking a $3,000-per-month research package with my daily telexes, weekly conference calls, biweekly and quarterly research re-\nports, and quarterly meetings. Over the next year, Rob brought in a number of institutions and institutional investment managers,\nincluding General Electric, Keystone Custodian Funds, the World Bank, Brandywine, Loomis Sayles, Provident Capital Manage-\nment, the Singer Company, Loews Corporation, GTE Corporation, and Wellington Management.\n\nAt that point, our business consisted of three main areas: consulting for fees, managing companies\u2019 risks for incentive fees,\nand selling the research packages. We worked with all sorts of corporate, financial, and government institutions that had market\nexposures\u2014banks, diversified international businesses, commodities producers, food producers, public utilities, and more. For\nexample, we would build a plan to help a multinational company deal with the currency exposure it faced from operating in differ-\nent countries.\n\nMy approach was to immerse myself in a business until I got to a point where I felt that the strategies I was handing off were\nthe ones I would use were I running the company myself. I would break each company down into distinct logical components and\nthen come up with a plan for managing each part, using a variety of financial tools, especially derivative instruments. The most\nimportant components to separate were the profits coming from the core business and those that were speculative profits and\nlosses coming from price changes. We would do this to show them what a \u201crisk-neutral\u201d position would look like, which is to say,\n\nthe properly hedged position one would take if one didn\u2019t have a view of the markets. I would advise them to deviate from this\n\f"}, "001270.png": {"text": "position only when they wanted to speculate, which they should only do in measured ways and with full knowledge of the effects\nit could have on their core business. This approach was eye-opening for most of the firms we worked with. It gave them clarity and\ncontrol, and yielded them better results. Sometimes they wanted us to speculate for them, which we would do for a share of the\nprofits.\n\nThis approach to establishing a \u201crisk-neutral\u201d benchmark position and deviating from it with measured bets was the genesis of\nthe style of investment management we would later call \u201calpha overlay,\u201d in which passive (\u201cbeta\u201d) and active (\u201calpha\u201d) exposures\nare separated. The return of a market (such as the stock market) itself is called its beta. Alpha is the return that comes from betting\nagainst others. For example, some people outperform the stock market and others underperform it; they are said to have positive\nor negative alpha. With alpha overlay, we were offering a way of making bets independent of underlying market performance.\nApproaching the market in this way taught me that one of the keys to being a successful investor is to only take bets you are highly\nconfident in and to diversify them well.\n\nOne of our clients in the mid-1980s was Alan Bond, an audacious entrepreneur who was one of the richest people in Australia.\nA self-made man, he was famous for being the first non-American to win the America\u2019s Cup yacht race in its then 132-year history.\nLike Bunker Hunt, he eventually bet badly and was forced to declare bankruptcy. I advised him and his team on their way up and\nstayed on through his downfall, so I watched the tragedy unfold from up close. His was a classic case of confusing business with\nspeculation and only hedging when it was too late.\n\nBond borrowed U.S. dollars to buy assets like breweries in Australia. He did that because U.S. interest rates were lower than\nthey were in Australia. Though he didn\u2019t realize it, he was speculating that the U.S. dollar, in which he would have to pay back his\nloans, would not rise. When the U.S. dollar did rise against the Australian dollar in the mid-1980s and his Australian-dollar beer-\nsales earnings weren\u2019t enough to pay his debts, his team called me for advice. I calculated what Bond Corp\u2019s position would be if\nthey hedged on currencies and saw that doing so would lock in losses that would ruin them, so I advised them to wait. When the\nAustralian dollar rallied, I advised them to put the hedges in place, but they didn\u2019t because they believed the currency problem had\n\ngone away. Before long, the Australian dollar plunged to new lows and they called me in for an emergency meeting. There wasn\u2019t\n\f"}, "001271.png": {"text": "much they could do without locking in ruinous losses, so they again did nothing, and this time the Australian dollar didn\u2019t rally.\nSeeing one of the richest and most accomplished men on the planet lose everything made a huge impression on me.\n\nWe also did one-off consulting projects related to the markets. In 1985, I worked with Paul Tudor Jones, a good friend and a great\ntrader, to design a U.S. dollar futures contract (a tradable index tracking the price of the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign cur-\nrencies) that traded (and still trades) on the New York Cotton Exchange. I also worked with the New York Futures Exchange to help\ndesign and market their CRB futures contract (a tradable index that tracks the price of a basket of commodities).\n\nUnlike most people who work in the markets, I never had any desire to build investment products, especially conventional ones,\njust because they would sell well. All I wanted was to trade the markets and build relationships, doing for our clients exactly what\nI would do if I were in their shoes. But I also loved building brand-new things, especially if they were great and revolutionary. By\nthe mid-1980s, a couple of things were clear to me: First, we were making good calls in the interest-rate and currency markets, and\nthe institutional investment managers who were buying our research were using it to make money. Second, we were successfully\nmanaging companies\u2019 interest-rate and currency exposures. With those two things going as well as they were, I figured we could\nbecome successful institutional investment managers ourselves. So I made the pitch to the people who ran the World Bank's pen-\nsion fund, most importantly Hilda Ochoa, who was its chief investment officer at the time. Despite the fact that we had no assets\nunder management and no track record, she gave us a $5 million U.S. bond account to manage.\n\nThat was a huge turning point for us, as it was the start of Bridgewater as we know it today. The strategy we used for the World\nBank shifted between holding cash and holding twenty-year U.S. Treasury bonds, because these positions would give us leveraged\nbets on the direction of interest rates. When our systems indicated that the pressures on interest rates would cause them to fall, we\nwould hold twenty-year Treasury bonds, and when the system pointed to rates rising, we would stay in cash. We did very well, and\nbefore long other large institutional investors gave us money to manage as well. Mobil Oil and Singer were our next two accounts\n\nand others followed in rapid succession. We went on to become the top-performing U.S. bond manager in the world.\n\f"}, "001272.png": {"text": "VENTURING BEHIND THE \u201cCLOSED DOOR\u201d OF CHINA\n\nPart of what was great about consulting was that it gave me opportunities to travel. The more unusual a place, the more interest-\ning I found it. This curiosity drew me to Beijing in 1984. The only images I'd seen of China when I was growing up were of masses\nof people waving Mao\u2019s Little Red Book, so having an opportunity to go behind what was still a mostly \u201cclosed door\u201d was alluring.\n\nI got the invitation because I had a small office in Hong Kong whose director was an advisor to CITIC, the \u201cwindow company\u201d that\n\n  \n\nwas the only business in China allowed to deal with the outside world. Beijing was filled with wonderful and incredibly hospitable\npeople who introduced us to the tradition of drinking shots of Moutai while shouting Ganbei! (Bottoms up!) and generally showed\nusa great time. This first trip, which I made with my wife and a few other people, began an incredibly rewarding thirty-plus-year\njourney that has had a profound impact on my family and me.\n\nThere were no financial markets in China at the time; eventually a small group put together by nine Chinese companies (includ-\ning CITIC) known as the Stock Exchange Executive Council began to develop them. They started in 1989, just before the Tianan-\nmen Square incident, which set them back because such market developments were still seen as too capitalist. They operated out\nof a small hotel room and hardly had any financing. I can still picture the big garbage bin under the metal stairway going up to\ntheir office. I really respected the risks these young people were taking by doing this at such an unsettled time, so I made a small\ndonation to give them a hand and was excited to share my knowledge with them. From nothing, these people built China\u2019s markets\nand the government\u2019s securities regulatory arm.\n\nIn 1994, I set up a company called Bridgewater China Partners. By then, I was convinced that China was poised to become the\ngreatest economy in the world in the twenty-first century, but hardly anyone was investing in China yet; good deals could still be\n\nstruck. I could bring money to the table by introducing my institutional investment clients to opportunities, and I could provide\n\f"}, "001273.png": {"text": "know-how by introducing Chinese companies to American ones. In exchange, we would get a stake in these companies. Essen-\ntially, I was setting up the first U.S.-based private equity firm in China.\n\nIlaunched the company by bringing a small group of institutional investor clients, who together managed $70 billion in assets,\nto China for a visit. When we got back, we agreed to move forward by setting up a jointly owned merchant bank in Beijing. While I\nknew that entering a territory where few had been before would require a lot of experimentation and learning, I soon realized I had\nsorely underestimated the complexity of the task we had set for ourselves and the amount of time it would take. I found myself\nconstantly on the phone at three in the morning, trying to make sense of the shaky accounting and questionable controls at the\ncompanies we were interested in\u2014with all my Bridgewater responsibilities awaiting me when the sun came up.\n\nAfter about a year of this, I could see that running both Bridgewater and Bridgewater China Partners wasn\u2019t going to be possible,\nso I closed its doors. Nobody made or lost any money, because I hadn\u2019t been comfortable enough with what I was seeing to make\nany investments. I\u2019m sure that if I had devoted all my time to it, we would have had great success, but then Bridgewater would\nnot be what it is today. Despite passing up this great opportunity, I don\u2019t regret my choice. I learned that if you work hard and cre-\natively, you can have just about anything you want, but not everything you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives\nin order to pursue even better ones.\n\nWhile I stepped away from that opportunity, China remained an important part of my own and my family\u2019s lives. We loved it,\nespecially the people. In 1995, my wife, Barbara, our eleven-year-old son, Matt, and I decided together that Matt would spend a year\nin Beijing, attending an all-Chinese school and living with our friend Madame Gu, who had stayed with us in America during the\nTiananmen Square days and whom Matt had visited in China with us when he was three. Standards of living in China were very\ndifferent from what Matt was accustomed to in Connecticut. For example, the apartment Madame Gu and her husband lived in had\nhot water for showers only twice a week, and the school Matt attended didn\u2019t have heat until well into the winter, so the students\nwore their coats in the classrooms. Matt didn\u2019t speak Chinese and none of his classmates spoke English.\n\nAll of this was not just a huge adventure for Matt; it was completely unprecedented and required special permission from the\n\nChinese government. I was excited for Matt because I knew he would see a different world and broaden his mind. Barbara needed.\n\f"}, "001274.png": {"text": "a little convincing and a couple of visits to a child psychologist for reassurance, but she had lived all around the world herself and\nknew how it had benefited her, so she was ultimately receptive to the idea, even if she was less excited about being separated from\nher son. Matt\u2019s difficult but life-changing journey profoundly affected his values and goals. Because he fell in love with China (he\nsays that he became part Chinese that year) and because he learned the value of empathy relative to the value of material wealth,\nhe started a charity called China Care to help Chinese special-needs orphans when he was just sixteen. He ran it for twelve years\n(and, to a much lesser degree, still does), while shifting his efforts to reconceive what computing can be in the emerging world,\nwhich he is executing through his company Endless. I in turn learned a lot from Matt, especially about the joys of philanthropy,\nand we both learned the deep pleasures of great personal relationships. Over the years, I (and in turn Bridgewater) have also built\nmeaningful relationships with many wonderful people in China, and we have helped its financial institutions grow from fledgling\norganizations to sophisticated giants.\n\nChina wasn\u2019t the only country whose people and governments Bridgewater would become involved with. Through their repre-\nsentatives, Singapore\u2019s, Abu Dhabi\u2019s, and Australia\u2019s government investment funds, and Russian and European policymakers, came\nknocking on our door. The experiences I have had, the perspectives I gained, and the help I was able to provide all added up toa\npackage of rewards as large as any of the others that I got out of my career.\n\nMy contact with Singapore\u2019s people and institutions also thrilled me. There was and still is no leader I admire more than Lee\nKuan Yew, who transformed Singapore from a mosquito-infested backwater to a model economy. That says a lot, as I have gotten\nto know and admire several world leaders. One of my most thrilling moments was a dinner I had with him at my house in New\nYork, shortly before his death in 2015. Lee requested the dinner to discuss the state of the world economy. I invited former Fed\nchairman Paul Volcker (another hero of mine), former Treasury secretary Bob Rubin (whose breadth of experiences gave great per-\nspective), and Charlie Rose (one of the most curious and insightful people I know). Besides answering his questions, we probed Lee\non world affairs and world leaders. Since he had personally known virtually all of the world\u2019s leaders over the last fifty years, we\nasked Lee about the qualities that distinguished the great ones from the bad ones and what he thought of those who were leading\n\nat the time. He rated Angela Merkel as the best leader in the West and considered Vladimir Putin one of the best leaders worldwide.\n\f"}, "001275.png": {"text": "He explained that leaders must be judged within the context of the circumstances they encounter and then went on to share his\nview of how difficult it is to lead Russia and why he thought Putin was doing it well.

This is true whether\nthey are rich or poor. Seeing life through the eyes of the indigenous people I got to know in Papua New Guinea was as illuminating\nfor me as gaining the perspectives of the political and economic leaders, world-changing entrepreneurs, and cutting-edge scien-\ntists I\u2019ve spent time with. I'll never forget the blind holy man I met in a mosque in Syria, who explained the Quran and his connec-\ntion to God to me. Encounters like these have taught me that human greatness and terribleness are not correlated with wealth or\nother conventional measures of success. I\u2019ve also learned that judging people before really seeing things through their eyes stands\nin the way of understanding their circumstances\u2014and that isn\u2019t smart. I urge you to be curious enough to want to understand\nhow the people who see things differently from you came to see them that way. You will find that interesting and invaluable, and\n\nthe richer perspective you gain will help you decide what you should do.\n\nMY FAMILY AND MY EXTENDED FAMILY\n\nMy family, my extended family of co-workers, and my work have all been extremely important to me. Juggling work and family\nhas been as much a challenge to me as to anyone else, especially since I wanted both to be great, so I combined them whenever I\ncould. For example, I took my kids on business trips. When at first I brought my son Devon and later Matt to my Chinese business\nmeetings, our hosts were always very kind\u2014they would give them cookies and milk. One great memory from Abu Dhabi was when\nmy clients/friends took my son Paul and me to the desert to eat a freshly killed and roasted goat with our bare hands. I asked Paul,\nwho was dressed in the traditional gown they\u2019d given him, how he liked it and he said, \u201cWhat could be better than to sit on the\n\nfloor, dressed in pajamas, eating with my hands, with nice people?\u201d We all laughed.

Bridgewater occupied part of it\nand my family occupied the rest. It was extremely informal and family-like: Everyone parked in the driveway, we met around the\nkitchen table, and my kids would leave the door open while they sat on the toilet. The people I worked with would wave as they\nwalked by.\n\nEventually, the farm was put up for sale so I bought a barn on the property and renovated it. My wife, our kids (eventually there\nwere four), and I lived in a small apartment inside the barn, and I made the unfinished hayloft usable as an office by putting in\nelectric baseboard heat, which I chose because it was cheapest to install. It was a great space for parties and there was enough land\nfor us to play soccer and volleyball and have outdoor barbecues. For our company Christmas party, we'd have a big potluck dinner\nwith my family. After a few drinks, Santa would show up and we'd all sit on his lap for a photo and find out who had been naughty\nor nice. The night always ended with a lot of dancing. We also had an annual \u201cSleaze Day\u201d when everybody would dress up sleazy.\nYou get the idea: Bridgewater was a small community of friends who worked hard and partied hard.\n\nBob Prince joined Bridgewater in 1986 when he was still in his twenties, and more than thirty years later we are still close part-\nners as co-chief investment officers. From the very start, Bob and I \u201cplayed great jazz together\u201d whenever we\u2019d go back and forth on\nideas. We still love doing that and will until one of us dies. He is also a great teacher, both to clients and co-workers. Over time, he\nbecame like my brother as well as one of the most critical builders and pillars of Bridgewater.\n\nSoon, Bridgewater began to look like a real company. We outgrew the barn and moved into a small office in a strip mall; there\nwere twenty of us by the end of the 1980s. But even as we grew, I never thought of anybody I worked with as an employee. I had\nalways wanted to have\u2014and to be around people who also wanted to have\u2014a life full of meaningful work and meaningful rela-\ntionships, and to me a meaningful relationship is one that\u2019s open and honest in a way that lets people be straight with each other.\nInever valued more traditional, antiseptic relationships where people put on a facade of politeness and don\u2019t say what they really\nthink.\n\f"}, "001277.png": {"text": "I believe that all organizations basically have two types of people: those who work to be part of a mission, and those who work\nfor a paycheck. I wanted to surround myself with people who needed what I needed, which was to make sense of things for myself.\nI spoke frankly, and I expected those around me to speak frankly. I fought for what I thought was best, and I wanted them to do so\nas well. When I thought someone did something stupid, I said so and I expected them to tell me when I did something stupid. Each\nof us would be better for it. To me, that was what strong and productive relationships looked like. Operating any other way would\n\nbe unproductive and unethical.\n\nMORE BIG TWISTS AND TURNS IN THE ECONOMY AND MARKETS\n\n1987 and 1988 were filled with more of those big twists and turns that helped shape me and my approach to life and investing. We\nwere one of the few investment managers who were short stocks ahead of \u201cBlack Monday,\u201d October 19, 1987, then the largest sin-\ngle-day percentage decline in the history of the stock market. We got a lot of attention because we were up 22 percent when most\nothers were down a lot. The media dubbed us as among the \u201cHeroes of October.\u201d\n\nNaturally, I was feeling pretty good going into 1988. I had grown up in an era of high volatility and had learned that the best way\nto play it was to get a hold of a big move and ride it. We used our indicators to catch shifting fundamentals and our technical trend-\nfollowing filters to confirm that price movements were consistent with what the indicators were suggesting. When they both\npointed in the same direction, we had a strong signal; when they were at odds, we had little or no signal. But as it turned out there\nwas hardly any volatility in 1988, and so our technical filters whipsawed us and we ended up giving back a bit more than half our\n1987 gains. That stung, but it also taught us some important lessons and prompted Bob and me to replace our technical trend-fol-\nlowing filter with better value measures and risk controls.\n\nUntil then our systems had been completely discrete\u2014we would flip from a fully long position to a fully short one when we\n\ncrossed a predetermined threshold (much as we switched from bonds to cash for the World Bank). But we weren't always equally\n\f"}, "001278.png": {"text": "confident in our views, and we'd also get killed paying transaction costs when we crossed back and forth. That drove Bob crazy.

These and other improvements Bob made to\nour systems have paid off many times since.\n\nNot everyone at Bridgewater saw things as Bob and I did. Some in the company doubted that systemization could work,\nespecially when the systems didn\u2019t do well, which, like normal decision making, happened every now and then. It took a lot of\nreasoning to persuade some of the people I worked with to press on. But even if I couldn\u2019t convince them, they couldn\u2019t change my\nmind, because they couldn\u2019t show me why our approach of clearly specifying, testing, and systemizing our logic wasn\u2019t preferable\nto making decisions less systematically.\n\nAll great investors and investment approaches have bad patches; losing faith in them at such times is as common a mistake as\ngetting too enamored of them when they do well. Because most people are more emotional than logical, they tend to overreact to\nshort-term results; they give up and sell low when times are bad and buy too high when times are good. I find this is just as true for\nrelationships as it is for investments\u2014wise people stick with sound fundamentals through the ups and downs, while flighty peo-\nple react emotionally to how things feel, jumping into things when they\u2019re hot and abandoning them when they\u2019re not.\n\nDespite our relatively poor investment performance, 1988 was a great year for Bridgewater, because by reflecting on and learn-\ning from our poor performance, we made systematic improvements. I have come to realize that bad times coupled with good re-\nflections provide some of the best lessons, and not just about business but also about relationships. One has many more supposed\nfriends when one is up than when one is down, because most people like to be with winners and shun losers. True friends are the\nopposite.\n\nI got alot out of my bad times, not just because they gave me mistakes to learn from but also because they helped me find out\n\nwho my real friends were\u2014the friends who would be with me through thick and thin.\n\f"}, "001279.png": {"text": "THE NEXT FOOTHOLD FOR BRIDGEWATER\n\nAs the 1980s came to an end, we were still a very small company, with just two dozen employees. Bob introduced me to Giselle\n\u2018Wagner in 1988. She would be my partner in running the noninvestment side of the business for twenty years. Dan Bernstein and\nRoss Waller joined in 1988 and 1989, respectively, both fresh out of Dartmouth College. At that time, and for quite a while longer, I\ntended to hire people just out of school who didn\u2019t have much experience but were smart, determined, and committed to the mis-\nsion of making the company great.\n\nI didn\u2019t value experience as much as character, creativity, and common sense, which I suppose was related to my having started\nBridgewater two years out of school myself, and my belief that having an ability to figure things out is more important than having\nspecific knowledge of how to do something. It seemed to me, young people were creating sensible innovation that was exciting.\nOlder folks who did things in the old ways held no appeal. I should add, though, that putting responsibility in the hands of inexpe-\nrienced people doesn\u2019t always work out so well. Some painful lessons that you'll read about later taught me that it can be a mistake\nto undervalue experience.\n\nBy now, the initial $5 million from the World Bank had grown to $180 million in investments that we were managing for a vari-\nety of clients, but we were still trying to grab a larger foothold in the institutional investment business. When Rusty Olson, CIO of\nKodak\u2019s pension fund, approached us to solve an investment problem, we jumped at the chance. Rusty was a remarkable innovator\nand a man of great character who'd started at Kodak in 1954 and took over its pension fund in 1972; he was widely respected as a\nleader in the pension fund world. We'd been sending him our research for a while, and in 1990 he wrote us looking for our opinion\nona big concern of his. The Kodak portfolio was heavily invested in equities and Rusty was worried about what would happen in\nan environment in which the value of his assets fell badly. He had been trying to come up with a way to hedge himself against this\n\nrisk without reducing his expected return.\n\f"}, "001280.png": {"text": "Rusty\u2019s fax arrived on a Friday afternoon and we leaped into action. Getting a client this prestigious and innovative would make\na big difference to us.

Bob Prince, Dan Bernstein, and I worked nonstop through\nthe weekend, analyzing the Kodak portfolio and the strategy Rusty was considering. Then we wrote him along memo laying out\nour thoughts.\n\nJust as I had deconstructed the business of a chicken producer in the 1970s and many other companies since, we broke down\nKodak\u2019s pension fund into its constituent parts to better understand the \u201cmachine.\u201d Our proposed solutions drew on the portfolio-\nengineering ideas that would later become core to Bridgewater's unique way of managing money.

But his model didn\u2019t tell you anything about the incre-\nmental effects of changing any one of those variables, or how to handle being uncertain about those assumptions.

Whether you own a hotel, run a tech-\nnology company, or do anything else, your business produces a return stream. Having a few good uncorrelated return streams is\nbetter than having just one, and knowing how to combine return streams is even more effective than being able to choose good\nones (though of course you have to do both). At the time (and still today), most investment managers did not take advantage of\nthis. They managed investments in a single asset class: equity managers managed equities, bond managers managed bonds, and\nso on. Their clients gave them money with the expectation that they would receive the overall return of the asset class (e.g., the\nS&P 500 stock market index) plus some added returns from the bets managers took by over- and under-weighting particular assets\n(e.g., buying more Microsoft stock than was in the index). But individual assets within an asset class are generally about 60 percent\ncorrelated with each other, which means they go up or down together more than half the time. As the Holy Grail chart showed, an\nequity manager could put a thousand 60 percent-correlated stocks into their portfolios and it wouldn\u2019t provide much more diver-\nsification than if they\u2019d picked only five.

Once we had them, we back-tested them over long time\nframes, using the systems to simulate how the decision rules would have worked together in the past.\n\nWe were startled by the results. On paper, this new approach improved our returns by a factor of three to five times per unit of\nrisk, and we could calibrate the amount of return we wanted based on the amount of risk we could tolerate. In other words, we\ncould make a ton more money than the other guys, with a lower risk of being knocked out of the game\u2014as I\u2019d nearly been before. I\ncalled it the \u201ckiller system\u201d because it would either produce killer results for us and our clients or it would kill us because we were\n\nmissing something important.\n\f"}, "001283.png": {"text": "The success of this approach taught me a principle that I apply to all parts of my life: Making a handful of good uncorrelated bets\nthat are balanced and leveraged well is the surest way of having a lot of upside without being exposed to unacceptable downside.\n\nAs excited as we were about this new approach, we proceeded cautiously. We gave the system a 10 percent weight initially and\nit made money in nineteen of the twenty months in our test period. As we got more confident, I decided to reach out to a select\ngroup of investors I knew well about investing in the strategy with $1 million trial accounts. I knew that asking these institutional\ninvestors to invest such relatively modest amounts would make it hard for them to turn us down. I called the new product \u201cTop\n5%\u201d at first, because it comprised the best 5 percent of our decision rules; later I changed the name to Pure Alpha to convey that it\nconsisted purely of alphas. Because Pure Alpha didn\u2019t have any betas, it didn\u2019t have any bias to go up or down along with any mar-\nket. Its returns depended only on how good we were in outperforming others.\n\nOur totally new \u201calpha overlay\u201d approach allowed investors to receive the return of their chosen asset class (the S&P 500 stock\nmarket, a bond index, commodities\u2014whatever) plus the return from the portfolio of bets that we were making across all asset\nclasses. As unprecedented as our approach was, we explained our logic carefully, showing why it was actually much less risky than\ntraditional approaches. We also showed them how we expected the cumulative performance to unfold and what the expected\nrange of performance around that would be. For our clients, it was a bit like being presented with the design of a plane that had\n\nnever flown before but looked radically better than any other plane on paper. Would anyone be courageous enough to get on board?\n\f"}, "001284.png": {"text": "GROSS CUMULATIVE ALPHA VS.

So while we tried to convince clients to adopt our way, by the end of the 1990s and into the early 2000s, Pure Alpha\nmade up only around 10 percent of our total assets under management.\n\nEven though we couldn't trade stocks and commodities in our pure bond accounts, we applied the portfolio structuring princi-\nples we'd discovered and used with Pure Alpha to give our bond clients higher returns at lower levels of risk. This included trading\nforeign government bonds, emerging market debt, inflation-linked bonds, corporate bonds, and the currency exposures that came\nwith the foreign investments. In our most unconstrained bond portfolios, we would make about fifty different types of bets, way\nmore than traditional bond managers traded. Doing so gave us a big edge and landed us at the top of many investment perfor-\nmance tables year after year.\n\nOur Pure Alpha product was just the first of a number of innovative designs we brought to our clients. In 1991, we had become\nthe first currency overlay managers for institutional investors. At the time, institutional investors were placing larger portions\nof their portfolios into global equity and bond markets. While investing internationally added valuable diversity, it also added\nunmanaged currency exposure. This was a big problem because the currency exposures added risk without adding any expected\nreturn. We had traded currencies for years and had developed expertise in portfolio engineering, so we were in a prime position to\nsolve this problem. Eventually we became the largest active currency manager in the world.\n\nWe also produced several other new and effective ways of managing money that flew exactly as they were designed. With each\none, we gave clients clearly stated performance expectations expressed in a chart that showed an accumulated profit line and the\nexpected variations around that line. We could do this because the systemization of our decision-making process allowed us to\n\nstress-test the performance of our decision making under a wide variety of conditions.\n\nSYSTEMIZING OUR LEARNING FROM MISTAKES\n\f"}, "001286.png": {"text": "Of course we continued to make mistakes, though they were all within our range of expectations. What was great is that we made\nthe most of our mistakes because we got in the habit of viewing them as opportunities to learn and improve. One of our most\nmemorable mistakes happened in the early 1990s, when Ross, who was in charge of trading at the time, forgot to put in a trade for\naclient and the money just sat there in cash. By the time the mistake was discovered, the damage was several hundred thousand\ndollars.\n\nIt was a terrible and costly error, and I could\u2019ve done something dramatic like fire Ross to set a tone that mistakes would not be\ntolerated. But since mistakes happen all the time, that would have only encouraged other people to hide theirs, which would have\nled to even bigger and more costly errors. I believed strongly that we should bring problems and disagreements to the surface to\nlearn what should be done to make things better. So Ross and I worked to build out an \u201cerror log\u201d in the trading department. From\nthen on, anytime there was any kind of bad outcome (a trade wasn\u2019t executed, we paid significantly higher transaction costs than\nexpected, etc.), the traders would make a record of it and we would follow up. As we consistently tracked and addressed those is-\nsues, our trade execution machine continually improved.\n\nHaving a process that ensures problems are brought to the surface, and their root causes diagnosed, assures that continual im-\nprovements occur.\n\nFor that reason I insisted that an issue log be adopted throughout Bridgewater. My rule was simple: If something went badly,\nyou had to put it in the log, characterize its severity, and make clear who was responsible for it. If a mistake happened and you\nlogged it, you were okay. If you didn\u2019t log it, you would be in deep trouble. This way managers had problems brought to them,\nwhich was worlds better than having to seek them out. The error log (which we now call the issue log) was our first management\ntool. I learned subsequently how important tools are in helping to reinforce desired behaviors, which led us to create a number of\ntools I will describe later.\n\nThis culture of bringing problems and disagreements to the surface generated a lot of discomfort and conflict, especially when\n\nit came to exploring people\u2019s weaknesses. Before long, things came to a boil.\n\f"}, "001287.png": {"text": "MY \u201cINTRACTABLE\u201d PEOPLE PROBLEM\n\nOne winter day in 1993, Bob, Giselle, and Dan proposed taking me out to dinner with the stated purpose of \u201cgiving Ray feedback\nabout how he affects people and company morale.\u201d They sent me a memo first, the gist of which was that my way of operating was\n\nhaving a negative effect on everyone in the company. Here\u2019s how they put it:\n\nWhat does Ray do well?\nHe is very bright and innovative. He understands markets and money management. He is intense and energetic. He has very high\nstandards and passes these to others around him. He has good intentions about teamwork, building group ownership, providing\n\nflexible work conditions to employees, and compensating people well.\n\nWhat Ray doesn\u2019t do as well:\nRay sometimes says or does things to employees which makes them feel incompetent, unnecessary, humiliated, overwhelmed,\nbelittled, oppressed, or otherwise bad. The odds of this happening rise when Ray is under stress. At these times, his words and ac-\ntions toward others create animosity toward him and leave a lasting impression. The impact of this is that people are demotivated\nrather than motivated. This reduces productivity and the quality of the environment. The effect reaches far beyond the single\nemployee. The smallness of the company and the openness of communication means that everyone is affected when one person is\ndemotivated, treated badly, not given due respect. The future success of the company is highly dependent on Ray\u2019s ability to man-\n\nage people as well as money. If he doesn\u2019t manage people well, growth will be stunted and we will all be affected.\n\f"}, "001288.png": {"text": "Ugh. That hurt and surprised me. I never imagined that I was having that sort of effect. These people were my extended family.\nI didn\u2019t want them to feel \u201cincompetent, unnecessary, humiliated, overwhelmed, belittled, oppressed, or otherwise bad.\u201d Why\ndidn\u2019t they tell me directly? What was I doing wrong? Were my standards too high? For Bridgewater to continue to be a one-in-\nten-thousand-type company we had to have exceptional people and hold them to extremely high standards. Was I demanding too\nmuch?\n\nThis looked to me like another one of those fork-in-the-road cases in which I had to choose between one of two seemingly\nessential but mutually exclusive options: 1) being radically truthful with each other including probing to bring our problems and\nweaknesses to the surface so we could deal with them forthrightly and 2) having happy and satisfied employees. And it reminded\nme that when faced with the choice between two things you need that are seemingly at odds, go slowly to figure out how you can\nhave as much of both as possible. There is almost always a good path that you just haven't figured out yet, so look for it until you\nfind it rather than settle for the choice that is then apparent to you.\n\nMy first step was to make sure I knew exactly what the problems were and how to handle them. So I asked Bob, Giselle, and Dan\nwhat they thought was going on. I learned that they personally, and many others who knew me well, weren\u2019t as demoralized by me\nas some others because they understood my heart was in a good place. If they hadn\u2019t known that they would have quit, because, as\nthey put it, \u201cI wasn\u2019t paying them enough money to put up with my crap.\u201d\n\nThey knew that I wanted the best for them and Bridgewater, and to get that I needed to be radically truthful with them andI\nneeded them to be radically truthful with me. This wasn\u2019t only because it produced better results, but also because being truthful\nwith each other was fundamental to how I believed we should be with each other. We agreed that being this way was essential, but\nsince it was making some people feel bad, something had to change.\n\nWhile those people I had contact with understood me, liked me, and in some cases even loved me, those who had less contact\nwith me were offended by my directness. It was clear that I needed to be better understood and to understand others better. I real-\n\nized then how essential it is that people in relationships must be crystal clear about their principles for dealing with each other.\n\f"}, "001289.png": {"text": "That began our decades-long process of putting our principles into writing, which evolved into the Work Principles. Those prin-\nciples were both agreements for how we would be with each other and my reflections on how we should handle every situation\nthat came up. Since most types of situations arose repeatedly with slight variations, these principles were continually refined. As\n\nfor our agreements with each other, the most important one was our need to do three things:\n\n1. Put our honest thoughts out on the table,\n2. Have thoughtful disagreements in which people are willing to shift their opinions as they learn, and\n3. Have agreed-upon ways of deciding (e.g., voting, having clear authorities) if disagreements remain so that we can move be-\n\nyond them without resentments.\n\nI believe that for any organization or for any relationship to be great, these things are required. I also believe that for a group\ndecision-making system to be effective, the people using it have to believe that it\u2019s fair.\n\nHaving our work principles written out and getting in sync about them in the same way we had with our investment principles\nwere essential for our understanding each other, especially since our unique way of operating\u2014this radical truth and radical\ntransparency\u2014that led to our unique results is counterintuitive and emotionally challenging for some.\n\nTrying to understand how we could get our meaningful work and meaningful relationships through this straightforwardness\nled me to speak with neuroscientists, psychologists, and educators over the decades that followed.

I call\nthese the \u201ctwo yous.\u201d They fight for control of each person. How that conflict is managed is the most important driver of our be-\nhaviors. That fighting was the biggest reason for the problems Bob, Giselle, and Dan raised.

While things were much\nbetter and more stable, we were still doing basically the same things I\u2019d been doing from the start\u2014wrestling with the markets,\nthinking independently and creatively about how to make our bets, making mistakes, bringing those mistakes to the surface, diag-\nnosing them to get at their root causes, designing new and better ways of doing things, systematically implementing the changes,\nmaking new mistakes, and so on.\u2018 This iterative, evolutionary approach allowed us to continually refine the investment systems\nthat I\u2019d begun building in 1982. Back then, we showed that a few bright guys with computers could beat the big, well-equipped es-\ntablishment players.

Over the decades that followed, he contributed a lot, grew into the co-chief investment officer role with\n\nBob Prince and me, and became a co-CEO. He also became like a godson to me.\n\f"}, "001292.png": {"text": "We also invested in more and more powerful computers.* Having our systems running through these machines freed us to get\nabove the daily movements of the markets and consider things from a higher level, where we could make novel, creative connec-\n\ntions that produced innovations for our clients.\n\nDISCOVERING INFLATION-INDEXED BONDS\n\nAround this time, I had dinner with David White, the man in charge of the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s money. David asked me how\nI would engineer the foundation\u2019s portfolio to produce a return that was 5 percent above the U.S. inflation rate. I answered that a\nportfolio of leveraged foreign inflation-indexed bonds with the currency hedged back to U.S. dollars should deliver exactly that.\n(The bonds needed to be foreign because there were no U.S. inflation-indexed bonds at the time, and they needed to be hedged to\nthe dollar so there would be no currency risk.)\n\nThinking about this later, I realized that we could create an entirely new and radically different asset class, so Dan Bernstein\nand I researched such a portfolio more closely. According to our analysis, this new asset class would perform even better than we'd\nthought. In fact, it would be uniquely effective because we could engineer it to have the same expected return as equities but with\nless risk and with a negative correlation with bonds and equities over long time frames. We showed this research to our clients and\nthey loved it. Before long, we became the first global inflation-indexed bond manager in the world. In 1996, U.S. Treasury deputy\nsecretary Larry Summers began looking into whether the U.S. should issue its own inflation-indexed bonds, and because we were\nthe only manager with a portfolio of such bonds, he called us in as experts.\n\nDan and I traveled down to Washington to meet with Summers, his Treasury colleagues, and a number of representatives from\nwell-known Wall Street firms. We were late (punctuality isn\u2019t one of my strengths) and the doors to the big meeting room at Trea-\nsury were locked. I wasn\u2019t going to let that stop me, so I knocked until someone opened it. It was a large room with a table in the\n\nmiddle and a press gallery off to the side. There was only one seat open at the table and it had Dan\u2019s nameplate in front of it\u2014we\u2019d\n\f"}, "001293.png": {"text": "agreed that he\u2019d be our one allowed representative since he\u2019d done a lot of the prep work. I had forgotten that, so I walked over to\n\nthe press gallery, grabbed a chair, and carried it next to Dan\u2019s so I hada seat at the table too. Dan describes that meeting as an anal-\nogy for what it was like for us in the 1990s in general: We had to barge our way into things. Larry Summers has since said that the\nadvice he got from us was the most important in shaping this market. When the Treasury did create the bonds, they followed the\n\nstructure we recommended.\n\nDISCOVERING RISK PARITY\n\nBy the mid-1990s, I had enough money to set up a trust for my family, so I began to think about what the best asset allocation mix\nfor preserving wealth over generations would look like. In my years as an investor, I had seen all sorts of economic and market\nenvironments and all kinds of ways that wealth could be created and destroyed. I knew what drove asset returns, but I also knew\nthat no matter what asset class one held, there would come a time when it would lose most of its value. This included cash, which\nis the worst investment over time because it loses value after adjusting for inflation and taxes. I also knew how difficult it was\nto anticipate the swings that cause those losses. I\u2019ve devoted my life to it and I\u2019ve made my share of bad calls; anticipating these\nswings wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d bet on others doing well when I wasn\u2019t around. Finding investors who have done well in all economic\nenvironments\u2014when inflation rises and when it falls, when there are booms and when there are busts\u2014is like finding needles in\na haystack, and they don\u2019t live forever so that\u2019s not a viable path. I didn\u2019t want the wealth I had created to protect my family to be\nwiped out after I was gone. That meant I had to create a mix of assets that could be good in all economic environments.\n\nIknew which shifts in the economic environment caused asset classes to move around, and I knew that those relationships had\nremained essentially the same for hundreds of years. There were only two big forces to worry about: growth and inflation. Each\ncould either be rising or falling, so I saw that by finding four different investment strategies\u2014each one of which would do well ina\n\nparticular environment (rising growth with rising inflation, rising growth with falling inflation, and so on)\u2014I could construct an\n\f"}, "001294.png": {"text": "asset-allocation mix that was balanced to do well over time while being protected against unacceptable losses. Since that strategy\nwould never change, practically anyone could implement it. And so, with help from Bob and Dan, I created a portfolio mix that I\ncould comfortably put my trust money in for the next hundred or more years. I called it the \u201cAll Weather Portfolio\u201d because it could\nperform well in all environments.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2003 I was the only \u201cclient\u201d investing in it because we didn\u2019t sell it as a product. But in 2003, the head of\nVerizon's pension fund, a longtime client, told us he was looking for an approach to investing that would do well across all environ-\nments. After Verizon made its investment, others quickly followed, and a dozen years later we were managing nearly $80 billion. It\nwas another industry-shaping concept. Seeing its success, other investment managers followed with their own versions. It is now\n\ngenerically called \u201crisk parity\u201d investing.\n\nTO REMAIN A BEAUTIFUL BOUTIQUE OR BECOME A GREAT INSTITUTION?\n\nWith our people and culture producing these industry-shaping investment products, Bridgewater really took off. By 2000, we were\nmanaging more than $32 billion, almost eight times what we had been managing just five years before. Our head count had dou-\nbled, so we moved out of our strip mall office into a larger space situated in a nature preserve on the banks of the Saugatuck River.\nBut while we continued to grow, it was never clear sailing. Building the business while managing investments required me to do\ntwo challenging jobs simultaneously and develop two distinct skill sets, while being a good father, husband, and friend. The de-\nmands of these roles changed over time, so the skills and abilities I needed changed as well.\n\nMost people assume that the challenges that go along with growing a large business are greater than those of growing a smaller\none. That is not true. Going from a five-person organization to a sixty-person organization was just as challenging as going from\na sixty-person organization to a seven-hundred-person organization\u2014and from a seven-hundred-person organization to a 1,500-\n\nperson one. Looking back, I can\u2019t say that the challenges were easier or harder at any of the various phases we went through. They\n\f"}, "001295.png": {"text": "were just different. For example, when I had no one to manage, I had the challenge of having to do almost everything myself. When\nI learned and earned enough to pay others, I had the challenge of managing them. Similarly, the challenges of wrestling with\nmarket and economic swings were constantly changing. I didn\u2019t think about it then, but it\u2019s obvious to me now that while one gets\nbetter at things over time, it doesn\u2019t become any easier if one is also progressing to higher levels\u2014the Olympic athlete finds his\nsport to be every bit as challenging as the novice does.\n\nVery soon we faced another critical choice: What kind of company did we want to have? Should we continue to grow or stay\nabout the same size?\n\nBy 2003, I had come to believe that we needed to grow Bridgewater into a real institution instead of remaining a typical bou-\ntique-sized investment manager. Doing this would make us better in many ways\u2014better technology, better security controls, a\ndeeper talent pool\u2014all of which would make us more stable and permanent. This meant hiring more people in technology, infra-\nstructure, and other areas, as well as additional HR and IT staff to train and support them.\n\nGiselle argued strongly that we should not grow. She believed that introducing a lot of new people would threaten our culture,\nand that the time and attention that hiring, training, and managing them required would dilute our focus. While I agreed with\nher points, I didn\u2019t like the alternative of not allowing ourselves to become all we could be. I felt about this fork-in-the-road choice\nthe way I felt about most others\u2014that whether or not we could have our cake and eat it too was merely a test of our creativity and\ncharacter. For example, I could envision ways in which technology would help us get the most out of people. After a fair amount of\n\nwrestling with these questions, we decided to go ahead.\n\nFLESHING OUT PRINCIPLES\n\nEver since Bob, Giselle, and Dan had presented me with the \u201cRay Feedback Memo\u201d in the 1990s, I had been much more explicit in\n\nwriting down and sharing my work principles in the same way I had written down my investment principles. At first, this took\n\f"}, "001296.png": {"text": "the form of shared philosophy statements and emails to the entire company. Then, whenever something new came along that\nrequired me to make a decision, I would reflect on my criteria for making that decision and write it down as a principle so people\ncould make the connections between the situation, my principle for handling these situations, and my actions. More and more,\nwe saw everything as \u201canother one of those\u201d\u2014another of a certain type of situation like hiring, firing, determining compensation,\ndealing with dishonesty\u2014that had principles for handling them. By having them explicitly written out, I could foster the idea\nmeritocracy by having us together reflect on and refine those principles\u2014and then adhere to them.\n\nThe number of principles started small and grew over time. By the mid-2000s, Bridgewater was beginning to grow rapidly, and\nwe had a number of new managers trying to learn and adapt to our unique culture\u2014and who were increasingly asking me for ad-\nvice. I was also beginning to have people from outside Bridgewater ask me how they could create idea meritocracies of their own.\nSo in 2006, I prepared a rough list of about sixty Work Principles and distributed them to Bridgewater\u2019s managers so they could\nbegin to evaluate them, debate them, and make sense of them for themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s a rough draft,\u201d I wrote in the covering memo,\n\u201cbut it is being put out now for comments.\u201d\n\nThis began an ongoing evolutionary process of encountering many situations, forming principles about how to deal with them,\nand getting in sync with other Bridgewater leaders and managers about them. Over time, I encountered most everything there is\nto encounter in running a company, so I had a few hundred principles that covered most everything. That collection of principles,\nlike our collection of investment principles, became a kind of decision-making library. Those principles are the basis of what you'll\nfind in Work Principles.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough to codify and teach our philosophy; we had to live it. As the company grew bigger, how that happened\nevolved. In Bridgewater\u2019s early days, everyone knew each other, so being radically transparent was easy\u2014people could attend\nthe meetings they wanted to and communicate with each other informally. But as we grew, that became logistically impossible,\nwhich was a real problem. How could people engage productively with the idea meritocracy if they didn\u2019t know everything that\n\nwas going on? Without transparency, people would spin whatever happened to suit their own interests, sometimes behind closed\n\f"}, "001297.png": {"text": "doors. Problems would be hidden instead of brought to the surface where they could be resolved. To have a real idea meritocracy,\nthere must be transparency so that people can see things for themselves.\n\nTo make sure this happened, I required that virtually all our meetings be recorded and made available to everyone, with\nextremely rare exceptions such as when we were discussing very private matters like personal health or proprietary information\nabout a trade or decision rule. At first I sent these tapes of management meetings unedited to the entire company, but that was a\nhuge burden on people's time. So I built a small team to edit the tapes, focusing on the most important moments, and over time\nwe added questions to create \u201cvirtual reality\u201d case studies that could be used for training.\u2018 Over time, these tapes became part of a\n\u201cboot camp\u201d for new employees as well as a window into an ongoing stream of situations connected to the principles for handling\nthem.\n\nAll this openness led to some very frank discussions about who did what and why, and as a result we were able to deepen our\nunderstanding of our different ways of thinking. This was enlightening to all of us in showing how differently people\u2019s brains\nworked. If nothing else, I could better appreciate people I\u2019d once wanted to strangle! Moreover, I recognized that managers who\ndo not understand people\u2019s different thinking styles cannot understand how the people working for them will handle different\nsituations, which is like a foreman not understanding how his equipment will behave. That insight led us to explore psychometric\n\ntesting as a way of learning how people think differently.\n\nDISCOVERING PSYCHOMETRIC TESTING\n\nEarly in my kids\u2019 lives, I'd had them tested by a brilliant psychologist named Sue Quinlan. Her assessments proved spot-on and\nprovided a great road map for how they would develop over the years. Because that testing process had been so successful, I\n\nworked with her and others to try to identify the best tests for determining what the people I worked with were like. In 2006, I\n\f"}, "001298.png": {"text": "took the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment for the first time and found its description of my preferences to be re-\nmarkably accurate.\n\nMany of the differences it described, such as those between \u201cintuiting people,\u201d who tend to focus on big-picture concepts, and\n\u201csensing people,\u201d who pay more attention to specific facts and details, were highly relevant to the conflicts and disagreements we\nwere having at Bridgewater. I began to look for other tests that could help us deepen our understanding of each other. This was\nslow going at first, largely because most of the psychologists I met were surprisingly squeamish about exploring differences. But\neventually I found a few great people, especially a psychologist named Bob Eichinger, who pointed me to a number of other very\nuseful tests.\n\nIn early 2008, I had most of Bridgewater\u2019s managers take the Myers-Briggs assessment. The results astounded me. I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve that some of them actually thought in the ways the test described, yet when I asked them to rate how well it described\n\nthem on a scale of one to five, more than 80 percent of them gave it a four or five.\n\nCREATING BASEBALL CARDS\n\nEven after we were armed with the Myers-Briggs data and other tests we'd taken, I found that we were still having a hard time con-\nnecting the dots between the outcomes that we were seeing and what we knew about the people producing them. Over and over\nagain, the same people would walk into the same meetings, do things the same ways, and get the same results without seeking to\nunderstand why. (Recently I came across a study that revealed a cognitive bias in which people consistently overlook the evidence\nof one person being better than another at something and assume that both are equally good at a task. This was exactly what we\nwere seeing.) For example, people who were known not to be creative were being assigned tasks that required creativity; people\nwho didn\u2019t pay attention to details were being assigned to detail-oriented jobs, and so on. We needed a way to make the data that\n\nshowed what people were like even clearer and more explicit, so I began making \u201cBaseball Cards\u201d for employees that listed their\n\f"}, "001299.png": {"text": "\u201cstats.\u201d The idea was that they could be passed around and referred to when assigning responsibilities. Just as you wouldn\u2019t have a\ngreat fielder with a .160 batting average bat third, you wouldn't assign a big-picture person a task requiring attention to details.\n\nAt first, this idea met a lot of resistance. People were concerned that the Baseball Cards wouldn't be accurate, that producing\nthem would be too time-consuming, and that they would only succeed in pigeonholing people unfairly. But over time, everyone\u2019s\nattitudes toward this approach of openly exploring what people are like shifted 180 degrees. Most people found that having this\ninformation out in the open for everyone to see was more liberating than constraining because when it became the norm, people\ngained the sort of comfort that comes with just being themselves at work that family members have with each other at home.\n\nBecause this way of operating was so unusual, a number of behavioral psychologists came to Bridgewater to evaluate it. I urge\nyou to read their assessments, which were overwhelmingly favorable.\u2018 The Harvard psychologist Bob Kegan called Bridgewater \u201ca\nform of proof that the quest for business excellence and the search for personal realization need not be mutually exclusive\u2014and\ncan, in fact, be essential to each other.\u201d\n\nIshould also explain that my personal circumstances at the time also drew me to psychology and neurology. While for the most\npart lam keeping my family members\u2019 lives out of this book to protect their privacy, I will tell you this one story about my son Paul\nas it is relevant and he is open about it.\n\nAfter graduating from NYU\u2019s Tisch film school, Paul headed out to Los Angeles to take a job. One day he went to the front desk of\nthe hotel where he was staying while he looked for an apartment and smashed their computer. He was arrested and thrown in jail,\nwhere he was beaten up by guards. Ultimately, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, released into my custody, and admitted to\nthe psychiatric ward of a hospital.\n\nThat was the beginning of a three-year roller-coaster ride that took Paul, Barbara, and me to the peaks of his manias and the\ndepths of his depressions, through the twists and turns of the health care system, and into discussions with some of the most\nbrilliant and caring psychologists, psychiatrists, and neuroscientists at work today. There is nothing to prompt learning like pain\nand necessity, and this gave me plenty of both. At times I felt as though I was holding Paul by the hand as he was dangling over a\n\ncliff\u2014from one day to the next, I never knew whether I could hold on or if he would slip from my grip. I worked intensely with his\n\f"}, "001300.png": {"text": "caregivers to understand what was going on and what to do about it. Thanks both to the help he received and his own great charac-\nter, Paul worked through this and is now better off than if he hadn't fallen into his abyss, because he developed strengths he didn\u2019t\nhave but needed. Paul was once wild\u2014staying out till all hours, disorganized, smoking marijuana and drinking\u2014but he now faith-\nfully takes his meds, meditates, goes to bed early, and avoids drugs and alcohol. He had loads of creativity but lacked discipline.\nNow he has plenty of both. As a result, he is more creative now than he was before and is happily married, the father of two boys,\nan accomplished filmmaker, and a crusader helping those who struggle with bipolar disorder.\n\nHis radical transparency about being bipolar and his commitment to helping others with it inspires me. His first feature film,\nTouched with Fire, which received lots of acclaim, gave many people who might have lost their lives to bipolar disorder both the\nhope and the path forward they needed. I remember watching him shoot one scene based on a real conversation between us\nin which he was manic and I was struggling to reason with him. I could simultaneously see the actor playing Paul at his worst\nwhile the real Paul was at his best, directing the scene. As I watched, my mind flashed over his whole journey\u2014from the depths\nof his abyss, through his metamorphosis into the strong hero standing in front of me, someone on a mission to help others going\nthrough what he had gone through.\n\nThat journey through hell gave me a much deeper understanding of how and why we see things differently. I learned that much\nof how we think is physiological and can be changed. For example, Paul\u2019s wild swings were due to the inconsistent secretions of\ndopamine and other chemicals in his brain, so he could change by controlling those chemicals and the activities and stimuli affect-\ning them. I learned that creative genius and insanity can be quite close to each other, that the same chemistry that creates insights\ncan cause distortions, and that being stuck in one\u2019s own head is terribly dangerous. When Paul was \u201ccrazy,\u201d he always believed his\nown illogical arguments, no matter how strange they sounded to others. While more extreme in the case of someone with bipolar\ndisorder, this is something I\u2019ve seen most everyone do. I also learned how people can control how their brains work to produce\ndramatically better effects. These insights helped me to deal with people more effectively, as I will explain in detail in Chapter Four,\n\nUnderstand That People Are Wired Very Differently.\n\f"}, "001301.png": {"text": "MAKING BRIDGEWATER ROCK-SOLID AND CUTTING-EDGE\n\nAt our annual town hall meeting in June 2008, I said that seen through my eyes Bridgewater was then, and always had been, \u201cboth\nterrible and terrific at the same time.\u201d After about five years of rapid growth toward building Bridgewater as an institution, we had\nencountered our newest set of problems. This was nothing new. Since I started Bridgewater we always had some problems because\nwe were always doing bold new things, making mistakes, and evolving quickly. For example, technology had changed so quickly\nduring the years we'd built the company that we had literally switched from using slide rules to spreadsheet software to advanced.\nartificial intelligence. With so much changing so fast, it had seemed pointless to focus on getting everything \u201cjust right\u201d when\nsomething newer and better was sure to come along. So we built our technology in a light and flexible way, which made sense at\nthe time but also created a number of hairballs that badly needed untangling. That same approach of moving quickly and flexibly\nhad been true throughout the company, so several departments had become overstretched as we grew. It had always been fun\nbeing cutting-edge, but we were having a hard time becoming rock-solid, especially in the noninvestment side of the business. The\norganization needed to be renovated in several ways\u2014but it wasn\u2019t going to be easy.\n\nIn 2008 I was working about eighty hours a week doing my two full-time jobs (overseeing our investments and overseeing the\ncompany), and in my opinion not doing well enough at either. I felt that I, and the company more broadly, were slipping from\nbeing pervasively excellent. From the get-go I had toggled acceptably between investment management and business manage-\nment. But now that we were a bigger company, the business management side was demanding much more time than I had to give\nit. 1conducted a time-and-motion study of all of my investment and management responsibilities; it showed it would take me\nabout 165 hours a week to achieve the level of excellence that I would be satisfied with in overseeing both our investments and\nmanagement. That was obviously impossible. Since I wanted to delegate as much as possible, I asked whether the things I was\n\ndoing could be done excellently by others, and if so, who those others were. Everyone agreed that most of those areas couldn't\n\f"}, "001302.png": {"text": "adequately be delegated. I clearly hadn\u2019t done a good enough job of finding and training others to whom I could delegate my\nresponsibilities.\n\nTo me, the greatest success you can have as the person in charge is to orchestrate others to do things well without you. A step\nbelow that is doing things well yourself, and worst of all is doing things poorly yourself. As I reflected on my position, I could see\nthat despite all of my and Bridgewater\u2019s amazing achievements, I had not achieved this highest level of success. In fact, I was still\nstruggling to achieve the second-highest level (doing things well myself), even though Bridgewater was extremely successful.\n\nAt the time, there were 738 people working at Bridgewater, with fourteen department heads. I oversaw the department heads,\nalong with a Management Committee I'd created because I knew I couldn\u2019t trust myself to know what was best without others\nprobing me. I had structured the reporting lines so that I both reported to the Management Committee and held its members ac-\ncountable for their oversight of the company. I wanted them to also own the responsibility of producing pervasive excellence and1\nwanted to be at their service in helping them achieve it.\n\nIn May 2008, I wrote an email to the five members of the Management Committee, copying the company, telling them that \u201cIam\nescalating to let you know that I have reached my limits and that the quality of my work, and my work-life balance, are both suffer-\n\ning unacceptably.\u201d\n\nTHE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS OF 2008\n\nRecognizing that I was stretched wouldn't by itself be enough to slow the flow of things coming at me, especially in the investment\narea at what proved to be a time of historic turbulence.\n\nBecause too often I had been painfully surprised by different types of events that hadn\u2019t happened to me before but happened\nin other times or other places\u2014like the currency devaluation of 1971, or the debt crisis in the early 1980s\u2014I'd developed our\n\neconomic and market principles to be timeless and universal. In other words, I knew that we needed to understand all important\n\f"}, "001303.png": {"text": "economic and market movements, not just those that happened to me, and to make sure the principles we were using to position\nourselves would have worked in all past times and all other countries.\n\nAs a result, back in the early 2000s, we had included a \u201cdepression gauge\u201d in our systems that specified the actions we should\ntake if a certain configuration of events began to play out in a way indicating a heightened risk of a debt crisis and depression. In\n2007, this gauge indicated that a bubble of debt was nearing its bursting point because the costs of debt service were outpacing\nprojected cash flows. Because interest rates were so close to 0 percent, I knew that central banks could not ease monetary pol-\nicy enough to reverse the downturn the way they had in prior recessions. This was the exact configuration that had led to past\ndepressions.\n\nMy mind and gut flashed back to my 1979-82 experience. I was now both thirty years more knowledgeable and a whole lot less\nconfident. While the dynamic in the economy seemed clear to me, I was much less sure I was right. I remembered how clearly it\nhad seemed to me that the debt bust I\u2019d been expecting in 1982 would sink the economy\u2014and how painfully wrong I had turned\nout to be.\n\nThat experience also drove me to learn a lot more about debt crises and their effects on the markets, and I researched and\ntraded through a number of them, including the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s, the Japanese debt crisis of the 1990s, the\nblowup of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000, and the fallout from the attacks\non the World Trade Center and Pentagon in 2001. With the help of my teammates at Bridgewater, I took history books and old\nnewspapers and went day by day through the Great Depression and the Weimar Republic, comparing what happened then with\nwhat was happening in the present. The exercise only confirmed my worst fears: It seemed inevitable to me that large numbers of\nindividuals, companies, and banks were about to have serious debt problems and that the Federal Reserve couldn\u2019t lower interest\nrates to cushion the blow, as was the case in 1930-32.\n\nMy fear of being wrong pushed me to seek out other smart folks to poke holes in my view. I also wanted to walk key policymak-\ners through my thinking, both to stress-test it and to make them aware of the situation as I saw it, so 1 went to Washington to\n\nspeak with people in both the U.S. Treasury and the White House.

Most of them didn\u2019t go very deep\ninto our reasoning or calculations before they dismissed them, with one exception: Ramsen Betfarhad, Vice President Dick Ch-\neney\u2019s deputy assistant of domestic policy. He worked through all our numbers and was concerned by them.\n\nBecause everything we saw lined up and we couldn\u2019t find anyone who could refute our views, we prepared our clients\u2019 portfolios\nby balancing our positions in a way that there would be considerable upside and limited downside in the portfolios if we were\nright and putting in a backup plan in case we were wrong. Though we thought we were well prepared, we were as worried about\nbeing right as we were about being wrong. The prospect of the world economy going over a waterfall was scary to all of us because\nof what it might mean to those who weren't protected.\n\nAs in 1982, when conditions deteriorated and circumstances increasingly transpired as we'd predicted, policymakers began to\npay more attention to us. Betfarhad had me come to the White House to meet with him. Tim Geithner, president of the New York\nFed, asked to see me as well. I brought Bob, Greg, and a young analyst named Bob Elliott to a lunch meeting with Geithner. We\nwalked him through the numbers and he literally turned white. When he asked me where we'd gotten them from, I told him they\nwere publicly available. We'd just put them together and looked at them in a different way.\n\nTwo days after our meeting with Geithner, Bear Stearns collapsed. That didn\u2019t trigger much worry for most people or for the\nmarkets, though it was a sign of what was to come. It wasn\u2019t until six months later in September, when Lehman Brothers col-\nlapsed, that everyone else connected the dots. At that point the dominoes fell fast, and though they couldn't contain all the dam-\nage, policymakers, most importantly Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, reacted brilliantly to create \u201ca beautiful deleveraging\u201d (i.e.,a\nway of lowering debt burdens while keeping economic growth positive and inflation low).\u00e9\n\nTo make this long story short, we navigated this period well for our clients, anticipating market moves and avoiding losses. Our\nflagship fund made over 14 percent in 2008, a year when many other investors recorded losses of more than 30 percent. We would\nhave done even better had we not feared being wrong, which led us to balance our bets instead of arrogantly and foolishly putting\n\nmore chips at stake.

I will explain\nthese differences in Economic and Investment Principles and won't digress into them now.\n\nAs former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan put it, \u201cThe models failed at a time when we needed them most... JP Morgan had the\nAmerican economy accelerating three days before [the Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse|\u2014their model failed. The Fed model failed. The\nIMF model failed . .. So that left me asking myself: What happened?\u201d Bill Dudley, president of the New York Fed, homed in on the\nproblem when he said, \u201cI think there\u2019s a fundamental problem in terms of how macroeconomists look at the economic outlook,\ngrowth, and inflation ... If you look at the big macro models, they don\u2019t have a financial sector typically in them. They don\u2019t admit\nthe possibility that the financial sector could essentially melt down, and therefore the monetary policy impulse could be com-\npletely impaired. So I think the lesson of the crisis is to do a lot more work to make sure that the finance people are talking to the\nmacroeconomist people and building models that are more robust.\u201d He was right. We \u201cfinance people\u201d see the world very differ-\nently from the way economists do. As a result of our success, policymakers reached out to us more, which led me to have alot more\n\ncontact with senior economic policymakers in the U.S. and around the world.

I met with these leaders without\nmaking judgments and without regard for their particular ideologies. I approached them like a doctor, just wanting to make the\nmost beneficial impact.\n\nThey wanted my help because my global macroeconomic perspective as an investor was very different from theirs as policy-\nmakers. We were both products of our environments. Investors think independently, anticipate things that haven\u2019t happened\nyet, and put real money at stake with their bets. Policymakers come from environments that nurture consensus, not dissent, that\ntrain them to react to things that have already occurred, and that prepare them for negotiations, not placing bets. Because they\ndon\u2019t benefit from the constant feedback about the quality of their decisions that investors get, it\u2019s not clear who the good and bad\ndecision makers among them are. They also have to be politicians.

These systems worked far better than we could with just our brains. Without them, we would have had to manage\nmoney the old and painful way: by trying to weigh in our heads all the markets and all the influences on them and then bring them\ntogether into a portfolio of bets. We would have had to hire and supervise a bunch of different investment managers, and because\nwe couldn't have blind faith in them, we'd have had to understand how each one made their decisions, which would mean watch-\ning what they were doing and why so we could know what to expect from them, while dealing with all their different personality\nissues. Why would I want to do that? It seemed to me that that way of investing or managing an organization was obsolete, like\nreading a map instead of following a GPS. Of course, building our system was hard work\u2014it had taken us over thirty years to do it.\n\nHaving too much money to manage can hurt performance, since the costs of getting in and out of positions can be high because\nbeing too big can push the markets. Making over 40 percent in 2010 had put us in the position of having to return a lot of money to\nclients who actually wanted to give us more to manage. We were always careful to stay safely short of being too big, lest we kill the\ngoose that lays the golden eggs.\n\nOur clients didn\u2019t want their money back\u2014they wanted us to grow it. So we were presented with the puzzle of how to maximize\nour capacity without hurting our performance. We hadn't looked at that before, because we'd never had that much money. We\nquickly discovered that if we just tweaked what we did and created a new fund that managed money the same way as Pure Alpha\nbut invested it solely in the most liquid markets, our expected returns would be the same and the expected risk (ie., volatility) only\nslightly higher.\n\nWe programmed this new approach into our computers, back-tested it to see how it worked in all countries and time frames,\nand explained it to our clients in detail so they could thoroughly understand the logic behind it. As much as I love and have ben-\nefited from artificial intelligence, I believe that only people can discover such things and then program computers to do them.\nThat\u2019s why I believe that the right people, working with each other and with computers, are the key to success.\n\nToward the end of the year, we opened \u201cPure Alpha Major Markets\u201d and clients invested $15 billion in it. Since then its returns\nhave been as expected\u2014that is, about the same as Pure Alpha\u2019s (actually better, but only slightly). Our clients were delighted.

As a result, I tended to hire people who were the same way\u2014who would dive right into challenges, figure out what to do\nabout them, and then do it. I figured that if they had great character, common sense, and creativity, and were driven to achieve our\nshared mission, they would discover what it took to be successful if I gave them the freedom to figure out how to make the right\ndecisions. I knew that micromanaging and handcuffing them wouldn't work because neither of us would like it. If I was the one\ntelling them what to do, I wouldn't be getting any leverage from them.

But in 2010, I was\nsixty years old and had been running Bridgewater for thirty-five years. Though I expected to be good for another ten years or so,\nI was ready to put my energy into other things. While I always wanted to be deep into the markets, I wanted to spend more time\nwith my family and friends, to help policymakers, and to pursue a few growing passions (like ocean exploration and philanthropy)\nas well as whatever else interested me. My plan was to step out as CEO while helping my replacements as a mentor, remain in my\ninvestment role, and take the time I gained from no longer managing the company to suck the marrow out of life while I still could.\nAs with all organizations, whether Bridgewater would succeed would come down to the people and the culture.

How they make those choices determines the character of the company,\n\f"}, "001311.png": {"text": "the quality of its relationships, and the outcomes it produces.

In the first, we are dependent on others and we learn. In the second, others depend\non us and we work. And in the third and last, when others no longer depend on us and we no longer have to work, we are free to\nsavor life.\n\nIwas beginning my transition from my second to my third phase. Both intellectually and emotionally, I was no longer as excited\nabout being successful as I was excited about having the people I cared about be successful without me.\n\nThad two jobs at Bridgewater to transition out of: overseeing the management of the company as chief executive officer, and\noverseeing the management of our investments as a chief investment officer. I wasn\u2019t going to stop playing the markets, because\nthat\u2019s a game I\u2019ve loved playing since I was twelve and I will keep playing until I die. But I didn\u2019t want to be needed in either role, be-\ncause of the key-man risk that would create for the company.\n\nMy partners and I understood that transitioning from the first generation of leadership to the next in a founder-led organization\nwith a unique culture is difficult, especially if the leader has been in place for along time. Bill Gates\u2019s transition out of the CEO role\n\nat Microsoft in 2008 was the most recent example of that but there have been many others.\n\f"}, "001313.png": {"text": "The biggest question I wrestled with was whether I should leave management completely or stay involved as a mentor. On the\none hand, I liked the idea of stepping out completely because it would give the new leadership the freedom to find their own ways\nof succeeding without me looking over their shoulder. My friends urged me to do that\u2014to \u201cdeclare victory,\u201d collect my chips, and\nmove on. But I wasn\u2019t confident that the transition would go well, as I hadn\u2019t done such a thing before. I do things through trial\nand error\u2014making mistakes, figuring out what I did wrong, coming up with new principles, and finally succeeding\u2014and I didn\u2019t\nsee why my transition should be any different. I also didn\u2019t believe that it would be fair for me to dump the heavy workload I was\ncarrying on those I was passing my CEO responsibilities to. I knew that Lee Kuan Yew, the wise founder and leader of Singapore for\nforty-one years, had transitioned out of his leadership responsibilities to be a mentor, and I had seen how well that went. For all\nthose reasons, I decided I would stay on as a mentor. That meant I would either not speak at all or speak last, but always be avail-\nable to provide advice. My partners liked the idea.\n\nWe agreed we should begin as soon as possible, so those replacing me could gain experience and we could make adjustments as\nneeded. Since what we didn\u2019t know about transitioning was greater than what we did know about it, we knew we would need to\nbe careful. We expected that transitioning well would take a number of years\u2014perhaps two or three, perhaps as many as ten. Since\nwe had worked together for many years, we were optimistic that it would be on the shorter end of that range.\n\nOn the first day of 2011 I announced to the company that I would be stepping down as CEO, with Greg Jensen and David Mc-\nCormick replacing me. On July 1, I handed over my management responsibilities to Greg, David, and the rest of the Management\n\nCommittee. Simultaneously, we explained our \u201cup-to-ten-year transition plan\u201d to our clients.\n\nLEARNING WHAT SHAPERS ARE LIKE\n\nNaturally the new management team struggled over the next eighteen months or so. We diagnosed why in the same way an engi-\n\nneer would diagnose why a machine is operating suboptimally so it could be reengineered to perform better.

Everyone agreed the gap was in what we called \u201cshaping.\u201d\n\nTo visualize what I mean by \u201cshaping\u201d and \u201cshapers,\u201d think of Steve Jobs, who was probably the greatest and most iconic shaper\nof our time, as measured by the size and success of his shaping. A shaper is someone who comes up with unique and valuable\nvisions and builds them out beautifully, typically over the doubts and opposition of others. Jobs built the world\u2019s largest and\nmost successful company by revolutionizing computing, music, communications, animation, and photography with beautifully\ndesigned products. Elon Musk (of Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity), Jeff Bezos (of Amazon), and Reed Hastings (of Netflix) are other\ngreat shapers from the business world. In philanthropy, Muhammad Yunus (of Grameen), Geoffrey Canada (of Harlem Children\u2019s\nZone), and Wendy Kopp (of Teach for America) come to mind; and in government, Winston Churchill, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,\nLee Kuan Yew, and Deng Xiaoping. Bill Gates has been a shaper in both business and philanthropy, as was Andrew Carnegie. Mike\nBloomberg has been a shaper in business, philanthropy, and government. Einstein, Freud, Darwin, and Newton were giant shapers\nin the sciences. Christ, Muhammad, and the Buddha were religious shapers. They all had original visions and successfully built\nthem out.\n\nWhile these are the biggest shapers, I saw that shapers come in varying sizes. You probably know a few personally. They might\nbe your local business, nonprofit, or community leaders\u2014the people who drive change and build lasting organizations. My objec-\ntive was to identify who the future shapers of Bridgewater would be\u2014either by helping the people who were replacing me in the\nCEO job become them or by finding shapers on the outside and bringing them in.\n\nOn October 5, 2011, a few months after I began to think about what makes a shaper, Steve Jobs died. I wrote about him in our\n\nDaily Observations, one of the very few times I used the space to address noninvestment-related content, because I admired him as\n\f"}, "001315.png": {"text": "aman who could visualize and execute in breathtakingly wonderful ways. Soon after, Walter Isaacson published his biography of\nJobs. I noticed a number of similarities between us, especially when he quoted Jobs\u2019s own words. Soon after that, an article titled\n\u201cIs Ray Dalio the Steve Jobs of Investing?\u201d came out in aiCIO, a prominent investment-industry publication. It also pointed out a\nnumber of similarities between us\u2014that I, like Jobs, started my businesses from scratch (his from a garage, mine from the second\nbedroom of my apartment), that we both came up with innovative products that reshaped how our industries did things, and that\nwe had unique management styles. Bridgewater has often been called the Apple of the investment world\u2014but to be clear, I didn\u2019t\nthink that Bridgewater or I held a candle to Apple and Jobs.\n\nIsaacson\u2019s book and the article pointed to other parallels in our backgrounds, goals, and approaches to shaping\u2014for example, we\nwere both rebellious, independent thinkers who worked relentlessly for innovation and excellence; we were both meditators who\nwanted to \u201cput a dent in the universe\u201d; and we were both notoriously tough on people. Of course, there were important differences\ntoo. I wished Jobs had shared the principles he had used to achieve his goals.\n\nI wasn\u2019t just interested in Jobs and his principles; I wanted to know about the qualities and principles of all shapers, so I could\nbetter understand the likenesses and differences between them and form an archetype of the typical shaper. I had followed that\napproach for understanding everything; for example, I had made an exhaustive study of recessions so that I could form a timeless\npicture of an archetypal recession and then understand the differences among them. I did that for all economic and market move-\nments and was inclined to do it for just about everything, because this approach helps me understand how things work. So it made\nsense I'd do that to understand shapers too.\n\nI started by exploring the qualities of Jobs and other shapers with Isaacson, at first in a private conversation in his office, and\nlater at a public forum at Bridgewater. Since Isaacson had also written biographies of Albert Einstein and Ben Franklin\u2014two other\ngreat shapers\u2014I read them and probed him about them to try to glean what characteristics they had in common.\n\nThen I spoke with proven shapers I knew\u2014Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Reed Hastings, Muhammad Yunus, Geoffrey Canada, Jack\nDorsey (of Twitter), David Kelley (of IDEO), and more. They had all visualized remarkable concepts and built organizations to\n\nactualize them, and done that repeatedly and over long periods of time. I asked them to take an hour\u2019s worth of personality assess-\n\f"}, "001316.png": {"text": "ments to discover their values, abilities, and approaches. While not perfect, these assessments have been invaluable. (In fact, I have\nbeen adapting and refining them to help us in our recruiting and management.) The answers these shapers provided to the stan-\ndardized questions gave me objective and statistically measurable evidence about their similarities and differences.\n\nIt turns out they have a lot in common. They are all independent thinkers who do not let anything or anyone stand in the way\nof achieving their audacious goals. They have very strong mental maps of how things should be done, and at the same time a will-\ningness to test those mental maps in the world of reality and change the ways they do things to make them work better. They are\nextremely resilient, because their need to achieve what they envision is stronger than the pain they experience as they struggle\nto achieve it. Perhaps most interesting, they have a wider range of vision than most people, either because they have that vision\nthemselves or because they know how to get it from others who can see what they can't. All are able to see both big pictures and\ngranular details (and levels in between) and synthesize the perspectives they gain at those different levels, whereas most people\nsee just one or the other. They are simultaneously creative, systematic, and practical. They are assertive and open-minded at the\nsame time. Above all, they are passionate about what they are doing, intolerant of people who work for them who aren't excellent\nat what they do, and want to have a big, beneficial impact on the world.\n\nTake Elon Musk. When he had just come out with the Tesla and showed me his own car for the first time, he had as much to say\nabout the key fob that opened the doors as he did about his overarching vision for how Tesla fits into the broader future of trans-\nportation and how important that is to our planet. Later on, when I asked him how he came to start his company SpaceX, the au-\ndacity of his answer startled me.\n\n\u201cFor a long time,\u201d he answered, \u201cI\u2019ve thought that it\u2019s inevitable that something bad is going to happen on a planetary scale\u2014a\nplague, a meteor\u2014that will require humanity to start over somewhere else, like Mars. One day I went to the NASA website to see\nwhat progress they were making on their Mars program, and I realized that they weren't even thinking about going there anytime\nsoon.\n\n\u201cThad gotten $180 million when my partners and I sold PayPal,\u201d he continued, \u201cand it occurred to me that if I spent $90 million\n\nand used it to acquire some ICBMs from the former USSR and sent one to Mars, I could inspire the exploration of Mars.\u201d\n\f"}, "001317.png": {"text": "When Lasked him about his background in rocketry, he told me he didn\u2019t have one. \u201cI just started reading books,\u201d he said. That\u2019s\nhow shapers think and act.\n\nAt times, their extreme determination to achieve their goals can make them appear abrasive or inconsiderate, which was\nreflected in their test results. Nothing is ever good enough, and they experience the gap between what is and what could be as both\na tragedy and a source of unending motivation. No one can stand in the way of their achieving what they\u2019re going after. On one\nof the personality assessments there is a category they all ranked low on called \u201cConcern for Others.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean quite\nwhat it sounds like.\n\nConsider Muhammad Yunus, for example. A great philanthropist, he has devoted his life to helping others. He received the\nNobel Peace Prize for pioneering the ideas of microcredit and microfinance and has won the Congressional Gold Medal, the Presi-\ndential Medal of Freedom, the Gandhi Peace Prize, and more. Yet he tested low on \u201cConcern for Others.\u201d Geoffrey Canada, who has\ndevoted most of his adult life to taking care of all the disadvantaged children in a hundred-square-block area of New York's Harlem,\nalso tested low on \u201cConcern for Others.\u201d Bill Gates, who is devoting most of his wealth and energy to saving and improving lives,\ntested low as well. Obviously Yunus, Canada, and Gates care deeply about other people, yet the personality tests they took rated\nthem low. Why was that? In speaking with them and reviewing the questions that led to these ratings, it became clear: When faced\nwith a choice between achieving their goal or pleasing (or not disappointing) others, they would choose achieving their goal every\ntime.\n\nThrough this investigative process, I learned that there are distinctly different types of shapers. The most important difference\nlies in whether their shaping comes in the form of inventing, managing, or both. For example, while Einstein shaped by inventing,\nhe didn\u2019t have to manage, and while Jack Welch (who ran GE) and Lou Gerstner (who ran IBM) were great managers/leaders of\npeople, they didn\u2019t have to be as inventive. The rarest cases were people like Jobs, Musk, Gates, and Bezos, who were inventive vi-\nsionaries and managed big organizations to build those visions out.\n\nThere are a lot of people who look like shapers, in that they came up with a great idea and got it to the point where they could sell\n\nit for a lot of money, but did not shape consistently. Silicon Valley has many of these types; perhaps they should be called \u201cinven-\n\f"}, "001318.png": {"text": "tors.\u201d I also saw that there were wonderful leaders of organizations who weren't classic shapers, in that they didn\u2019t come up with\nthe original visions and build them out; rather, they entered existing organizations and led them well. Only true shapers consis-\ntently move from one success to another and sustain success over decades, and those are the people I want to bring to Bridgewater.\n\nMy examination of shapers and my reflections on my own qualities made clear to me that nobody sees the full range of what\nthey need to see in order to be exceptionally successful, though some see a wider range than others. Those that do best both see a\nwide range themselves while triangulating well with other brilliant people who see things in different, complementary ways.\n\nThis realization has been important in making my transition out of management go well. While in the past I would encounter\nproblems, figure out their causes, and design my own ways to get around them, others who think differently than I do will make\ndifferent diagnoses and designs. My job as mentor was to help them be successful at that.\n\nThis exercise reminded me that there are far fewer types of people in the world than there are people and far fewer different\ntypes of situations than there are situations, so matching the right types of people to the right types of situations is key.\n\nBecause Gates and Jobs had recently left Microsoft and Apple, I watched their former organizations closely to help me better\nunderstand how I could help prepare Bridgewater to thrive without me. Certainly the most notable difference between them and\nBridgewater was in our cultures\u2014how we use the idea meritocracy of radical truth and radical transparency to bring problems and\n\nweaknesses to the surface to prompt forthright dealing with them.\n\nSYSTEMIZING OUR IDEA MERITOCRACY\n\nThe more I did the research on people, the clearer it became that there are different types of people and that, by and large, the same\ntypes of people in the same types of circumstances are going to produce the same types of results. Said differently, by knowing\nwhat someone is like we can have a pretty good idea of what we can expect from them. So I was more motivated than ever to con-\n\ntinue gathering lots of data on what people are like to build pointillist pictures of them to help us match people to responsibilities\n\f"}, "001319.png": {"text": "well. Doing this in an evidence-based way would enhance the idea-meritocratic process of aligning people's responsibilities with\ntheir merits.\n\nWhile this all seemed so clear and commonsensical to me, it was much harder to achieve in practice. About a year into my\ntransition, I saw that many new managers (and some older ones) still couldn't see the patterns of people\u2019s behaviors through time\n(in other words, they couldn\u2019t connect the dots between what people are like and the outcomes they produce). Their reluctance to\nprobe hard to get at what people are like was making things more difficult.\n\nBut then I had a breakthrough, which grew out of an observation that the challenges we were having with making management\ndecisions didn\u2019t exist in our investment decision making. I realized that, by using big data analytics and other algorithms, our\ncomputers could connect those dots more efficiently than any of us could, just as they had helped us make connections in the\nmarkets. These systems also didn\u2019t have personal biases and emotional barriers to overcome, so those being analyzed couldn\u2019t be\noffended by the data-driven conclusions the computers were coming up with. In fact, they could look at the data and algorithms,\nassess them for themselves, and suggest changes if they wanted. We were like scientists trying to develop tests and algorithms for\nanalyzing ourselves objectively.\n\nOn November 10, 2012, I shared my thoughts with the Management Committee in an email. Its subject line was \u201cThe Path Out:\n\nSystemizing Good Management\u201d:\n\nIt is now clear to me that the main difference behind why the investment management part of Bridgewater is likely to continue to\ndo well and most of the other parts of Bridgewater are unlikely to do as well (if we don\u2019t change how we are operating) is that the\ndecision-making processes for investment management have been so systemized that it\u2019s hard for people to screw them up (because\nthey are largely following the systems\u2019 instructions) while the other areas of Bridgewater are much more dependent on the quality\n\nof the people and their decision making.\n\f"}, "001320.png": {"text": "Think about that. Imagine how Bridgewater\u2019s investment decision making would work if it operated the same as Bridgewa-\nter\u2019s management decision making (i.e., dependent on the people we hired and how they collectively made decisions in their own\nways). It would be a mess.\n\nThe way the investment decision-making process works is that a small group of investment managers who created these\nsystems see the systems\u2019 conclusions and the reasoning of the systems while we make our own conclusions and explore our reason-\ning on our own. ... The machine does most of the work and we interact with it in a quality way. .. . [And] we are not dependent on\nmuch more faulty people.\n\nThink about how different management is. While we have principles, we don\u2019t have decision-making systems.\n\nIn other words, I believe that the investment decision-making process is effective because the investment principles have been\nput into decision rules that make decisions that people then follow while the management decision-making process is less effective\nbecause the management principles have not been put into decision rules that people can follow to make management decisions.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Having built the investment systems (with the help of others) and knowing about both invest-\nment decision making and management decision making, I am confident that it can be the same. The only questions are whether it\ncan happen fast enough and what will happen in the meantime.\n\nIam working with Greg (and others) to develop these management systems in the same way I worked with Greg and others\n(Bob, etc.) on the investment systems. You are seeing this happen via the development of the Baseball Cards, Dot Collector, Pain\nButton, testing, job specing, etc. Because I have a limited time to do this, we need to move fast. At the same time we will have to fight\nthe battles in the trenches, with hand-to-hand combat, to clean out those who are incapable and bring in or promote those who are\n\nexcellent.\n\nOne of the great things about algorithmic decision making is that it focuses people on cause-effect relationships and, in that\n\nway, helps foster a real idea meritocracy.

The good habits come from thinking repeatedly in a principled way, like\nlearning to speak a language. The good thinking comes from exploring the reasoning behind the principles.\n\nThe ultimate goal of all this was to help the people I cared about be more successful without me, which was becoming increas-\ningly pressing as life\u2019s milestones continued to remind me of my stage in life. For example, I became a grandfather with the birth\nof Christopher Dalio on May 31, 2013. And in the summer of 2013, I had a serious health scare that turned out to be nothing but\nreminded me of my mortality. At the same time, I still loved playing the markets, which I plan to do until I die, making me even\n\nmore eager to speed the transition from the second to the third phase of my life.\n\nANTICIPATING THE EUROPEAN DEBT CRISIS\n\nBeginning in 2010, my Bridgewater colleagues and I began to see the emergence of a debt crisis in Europe. We had looked at how\nmuch debt had to be sold and how much could be bought for a number of countries and determined that many Southern European\nnations were likely to come up short. The resulting crisis could be as bad as or worse than the one in 2008-09.\n\nAs in 1980 and 2008, while our calculations clearly pointed to a debt crisis ahead, I knew that I could be wrong. Because it would\nbe a big deal if I was right, I wanted to discuss what I was seeing with top policymakers both to alert them and to have them correct\nme if they saw things differently. I encountered the same sort of resistance without good explanations that I had encountered in\n\nWashington in 2008, only this time in Europe. Things were stable at the time, and though I knew there was no reason to believe\n\f"}, "001322.png": {"text": "they would stay that way, most of the people I spoke to weren't ready to listen to my reasoning. I remember a meeting I had with\nthe head of the International Monetary Fund when we were still in the calm before the storm. He doubted my seemingly crazy con-\nclusions, and he wasn\u2019t interested in going through the numbers.\n\nJust as U.S. policymakers had before 2008, the Europeans did not fear what they hadn\u2019t experienced before. Because things\nwere good at the time and the picture I was painting was worse than anything they\u2019d experienced in their lifetimes, they found\nwhat I was saying implausible. They also didn\u2019t possess a granular understanding of who the borrowers and lenders were and\nhow their abilities to borrow and lend would change with changing market conditions. Their understandings of how markets and\neconomies work were oversimplified, like those of academics. For example, they looked at investors as a single thing they called\n\u201cthe market,\u201d rather than an amalgam of different players who bought and sold for different reasons. When the markets did badly,\nthey wanted to do things that increased confidence, figuring that if they built confidence the money would come and the problems\nwould disappear. They didn\u2019t see that whether they were confident or not, specific buyers didn\u2019t have enough money and credit to\nbuy all the debt that had to be sold.\n\nJust as all human bodies work in essentially the same way, so do the economic machines in different countries. And just as phys-\nical diseases infect people without regard to nationality, so do economic diseases. So, while the policymakers were at first skeptical,\nI approached my conversations with them by looking at the physiology of the case at hand. I would diagnose the economic disease\nthey were suffering from, and show them how its symptoms progress by referencing prior analogous cases. Then I\u2019d explain the\nbest practices for treating the disease at its different stages. We would have high-quality back-and-forths about the linkages and\nthe evidence.\n\nYet even when I did succeed in helping them see the linkages, the political decision-making systems they had to work within\nwere dysfunctional. Not only did they have to decide what they would do as individual countries, the nineteen countries of the\nEuropean Union had to agree with each other before they could act\u2014in many cases unanimously. There was often no clear way of\nresolving disagreements, which was a big problem because what needed to be done (printing money) was objectionable to German\n\neconomic conservatives. As a result, crises would intensify to breaking points while Europe's leaders grappled in long closed-door\n\f"}, "001323.png": {"text": "meetings. Those power struggles tested the nerves of everyone involved. I can\u2019t possibly convey the amount of bad behavior these\npolicymakers had to endure for the benefit of the people they represented.\n\nFor example, in January 2011, a few weeks after he\u2019d been appointed minister of economy and competitiveness by Spain\u2019s new\npresident, I met Luis de Guindos, a man I learned to admire for his forthrightness, intelligence, and heroic willingness to sacrifice\nhimself for his country\u2019s well-being. The old government in Spain had been thrown out and the new government took office as\nSpanish banks were about to collapse. The new Spanish policymakers were immediately forced to haggle with representatives\nfrom the IMF, the European Union, and the European Central Bank (the \u201cTroika\u201d as it was called). They did this into the wee hours\nof the morning and at the end were required to sign a loan agreement that essentially handed over control of their banking system\nto the Troika in exchange for the financial support they desperately needed.\n\nMy meeting with Minister de Guindos took place the morning after the first and most difficult of these negotiations. With\nbloodshot eyes but a very alert mind, he patiently and forthrightly answered all my difficult questions and shared his thoughts\nabout what reforms Spain should undertake to deal with their problems. During the next couple of years, over considerable objec-\ntions, he and his government pushed these controversial reforms through. He never got the praise he deserved, but he didn\u2019t care\nbecause his satisfaction came from seeing the results he produced. To me, that is a hero.\n\nAs time passed, the European debtor countries fell into deeper depressions. This led Mario Draghi, the president of the European\nCentral Bank, to make the bold decision to buy bonds in September 2012. This move averted the imminent debt crisis, saved the\neuro, and, as it would turn out, made a lot of money for the ECB. But it failed to immediately stimulate credit and economic growth\nin the countries that were in depression. Inflation, which the ECB was mandated to get to about 2 percent, was below that target\nand falling. While the ECB had offered loans on attractive terms to banks in an attempt to solve this issue, banks weren't taking\nthem up on the offer sufficiently to make a difference. I believed that things would continue to worsen unless the ECB \u201cprinted\nmoney\u201d and pushed it into the system by buying more bonds. The move toward quantitative easing appeared obvious and neces-\n\nsary to me, so I visited Draghi and the ECB\u2019s executive board to share my concerns.\n\f"}, "001324.png": {"text": "At the meeting, I told them why this approach would not be inflationary (because it is the level of spending, which is money\nplus credit, and not just the amount of money, that drives spending and inflation). I focused on how the economic machine works\nbecause I felt that if we could agree on that\u2014most importantly, how buying bonds moves money through the system\u2014we could\nagree on its impacts on inflation and economic growth. In that meeting, and in all such meetings, I shared our calculations as well\nas the important cause-effect relationships as I saw them, so that together we could assess whether the conclusions made sense.\n\nA major impediment to this action was that there is no single bond market for the entire Eurozone, and the ECB, like most\ncentral banks, isn\u2019t supposed to favor one area/country over another. Given those conditions, I shared my theory for how the ECB\ncould do quantitative easing without breaking its rules by buying bonds proportionately across every member country, even\nthough Germany didn\u2019t need or want the easing that such purchases would bring them. (The German economy was doing rela-\ntively well and inflation fears were beginning to emerge there.)\n\nIn the course of those eighteen months, I met with several top European economic policymakers, perhaps most importantly\nGerman finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, whom I judged to be exceptionally thoughtful and selfless. I also saw how politics\nwithin Germany and Europe worked.2 When push came to shove, the ECB would have to do what was best for Europe, which was\nto print the money and buy the bonds in the way I had suggested. Doing that was consistent with the ECB\u2019s mandate, and the\nSouthern European debtor countries had the votes to allow it to do that, so I figured that it would be the Germans who would get\noverruled and face the decision to leave the Eurozone, which they would ultimately not do because their leaders had a strong com-\nmitment to the Eurozone with Germany as part of it.\n\nDraghi finally announced the move in January 2015. It had a great effect and created a precedent that would allow more quan-\ntitative easings in the future if they were needed. The market reaction was very positive. On the day of Draghi\u2019s announcement\nEuropean equities were up a percent and a half, government bond yields fell across the major European economies, and the euro\nfell 2 percent against the dollar (which helped stimulate the economy). These moves continued over the following months, stimu-\n\nlating European economies, supporting a pickup in growth, and reversing the decline in inflation.\n\f"}, "001325.png": {"text": "The ECB\u2019s decision was obviously the right thing to do, for reasons that were relatively simple. But seeing how controversial its\nmove was, it occurred to me that the world needed a simple explanation of how the economic machine works, because if everyone\nunderstood the basics, then economic policymakers would be able to do the right things a lot faster and with less angst in the\nfuture. That led me to make a thirty-minute video, How the Economic Machine Works, which I released in 2013. Besides explaining\nhow the economy works it provides a template that helps people assess their economies and gives them guidance about what to do\nand what to expect during a crisis. It had a much bigger impact than I expected, as it was watched by more than five million people\nin eight languages. A number of policymakers told me in private that they found it helpful for their own understanding, for deal-\ning with their constituents, and for finding better paths forward. This was very rewarding to me.\n\nFrom my contacts with policymakers in a number of countries I learned quite a bit about how international relations really\nworks. It is quite different from what most people imagine. Countries behave in a more self-interested and less considerate way\nthan what most of us would consider appropriate for individuals. When countries negotiate with one another, they typically oper-\nate as if they are opponents in a chess match or merchants in a bazaar in which maximizing one\u2019s own benefit is the sole objective.\nSmart leaders know their own countries\u2019 vulnerabilities, take advantage of others\u2019 vulnerabilities, and expect the other countries\u2019\nleaders to do the same.\n\nMost people who haven't had direct contact with the leadership of their own and other countries form their views based on\nwhat they learn in the media, and become quite naive and inappropriately opinionated as a result. That\u2019s because dramatic stories\nand gossip draw more readers and viewers than does clinical objectivity. Also, in some cases \u201cjournalists\u201d have their own ideologi-\ncal biases that they are trying to advance. As a result, most people who see the world through the lens of the media tend to look for\nwho is good and who is evil rather than what the vested interests and relative powers are and how they are being played out. For\nexample, people tend to embrace stories about how their own country is moral and the rival country is not, when most of the time\nthese countries have different interests that they are trying to maximize. The best behaviors one can hope for come from leaders\nwho can weigh the benefits of cooperation, and who have long enough time frames that they can see how the gifts they give this\n\nyear may bring them benefits in the future.\n\f"}, "001326.png": {"text": "These conflicts of vested interests don\u2019t just play out internationally; it can also be nasty within countries. Finding out what\u2019s\ntrue and trying to do what\u2019s in everyone's best interests is rare, though most policymakers pretend that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. More\ntypically, they act in support of their constituents\u2019 interests. For example, representatives of those with greater income will say\nhigher taxes stifle growth while representatives of those with less income will say the opposite. It\u2019s hard to get everyone to even try\nto look at the whole picture objectively, let alone to operate in the interests of the whole.\n\nNonetheless, I came to respect most of the policymakers I worked with and to feel sorry for them because of the terrible\npositions they were in. Most are highly principled people who are forced to operate in unprincipled environments. The job of a\npolicymaker is challenging under the best of circumstances, and it\u2019s almost impossible during a crisis. The politics are horrendous\nand distortions and outright misinformation from the media make things worse. A number of the policymakers I met\u2014including\nDraghi, de Guindos, Schauble, Bernanke, Geithner, Summers, and many others\u2014were real heroes, meaning that they put others\nand the mission they committed to above themselves. Unfortunately, most policymakers enter their careers as idealists and leave\ndisillusioned.\n\nOne of those heroes I have been fortunate enough to learn from and, I hope, help is China\u2019s Wang Qishan, who has been a re-\nmarkable force for good for decades. To explain what he is like and the journey that took him to the top of China\u2019s leadership would\ntake more of this book than I can spare. In brief, Wang is a historian, a very high-level thinker, and a very practical man. I have\nrarely known a person to be both extremely wise and extremely practical. A leading shaper of the Chinese economy for decades\nwho is also responsible for eliminating corruption, he is known to be a no-nonsense man who can be trusted to get stuff done.\n\nEvery time I go to China, we meet for sixty to ninety minutes. We talk about what's happening in the world, and how that relates\nto thousands of years of history and the never-changing nature of mankind. We discuss a wide range of other topics as well, rang-\ning from physics to artificial intelligence. We are both keenly interested in how most everything happens over and over again, the\nforces behind those patterns, and the principles that work and don\u2019t work in dealing with them.\n\nI gave Wang a copy of Joseph Campbell's great book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, because he is a classic hero and I thought\n\nit might help him. I also gave him The Lessons of History, a 104-page distillation of the major forces through history by Will and\n\f"}, "001327.png": {"text": "Ariel Durant, and River Out of Eden by the insightful Richard Dawkins, which explains how evolution works. He gave me Georgi\nPlekhanov\u2019s classic On the Role of the Individual in History. All these books showed how the same things happened over and over\nagain throughout history.\n\nMost of my conversations with Wang are at the principle level; he sees the rhyme of history and puts the particulars we speak\nof in that context. \u201cUnattainable goals appeal to heroes,\u201d he once told me. \u201cCapable people are those who sit there worrying about\nthe future. The unwise are those who worry about nothing. If conflicts got resolved before they became acute, there wouldn't be\nany heroes.\u201d His advice has helped me in my planning for Bridgewater\u2019s future. For example, when I asked him about checks and\nbalances of power, he pointed to Julius Caesar\u2019s overthrow of the Roman Senate and Republic as an illustration of how important it\nis to make sure no one person is more powerful than the system. I took his advice to heart as I set out to improve Bridgewater\u2019s gov-\nernance model.\n\nEvery time I speak with Wang, I feel like I get closer to cracking the unifying code that unlocks the laws of the universe. He uses\nhis timeless perspective to see the present and the likely future more clearly.\n\nBeing around such people, especially if I can help them, is thrilling to me.\n\nRETURNING THE BOON\n\nJoseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces, one of the books I gave to Wang as well as a number of other heroes I know, was\nintroduced to me by my son Paul in 2014. While I had seen Campbell on television nearly thirty years earlier and remembered\nbeing impressed by him, I hadn\u2019t read his book. In it, Campbell looks at large numbers of \u201cheroes\u201d from different cultures\u2014some\nreal and some mythical\u2014and describes their archetypal journeys through life. Campbell\u2019s description of how heroes become he-\nroes aligned with my thinking about shapers. And it gave me powerful insights about the heroes I know and the patterns of my\n\nown life.\n\f"}, "001328.png": {"text": "For Campbell, a \u201chero\u201d isn\u2019t a perfect person who always gets things right. Far from it. A hero is someone who \u201cfound or achieved\nor [did] something beyond the normal range of achievement,\u201d and who \u201chas given his life to something bigger than himself or\nother than himself.\u201d I had met a number of such people throughout my life. What was most interesting about Campbell\u2019s work was\nhis description of how they got that way. Heroes don\u2019t begin as heroes; they just become them because of the way one thing leads\nto another. The diagram on the following page shows the archetypal hero\u2019s journey.\n\nThey typically start out leading ordinary lives in an ordinary world and are drawn by a \u201ccall to adventure.\u201d This leads them\ndown a \u201croad of trials\u201d filled with battles, temptations, successes, and failures. Along the way, they are helped by others, often by\nthose who are further along the journey and serve as mentors, though those who are less far along also help in various ways. They\nalso gain allies and enemies and learn how to fight, often against convention. Along the way, they encounter temptations and have\nclashes and reconciliations with their fathers and their sons. They overcome their fear of fighting because of their great determi-\nnation to achieve what they want, and they gain their \u201cspecial powers\u201d (i.e., skills) from both \u201cbattles\u201d that test and teach them,\nand from gifts (such as advice) that they receive from others. Over time, they both succeed and fail, but they increasingly succeed\nmore than they fail as they grow stronger and keep striving for more, which leads to ever-bigger and more challenging battles.\n\nHeroes inevitably experience at least one very big failure (which Campbell calls an \u201cabyss\u201d or the \u201cbelly of the whale\u201d experi-\nence) that tests whether they have the resilience to come back and fight smarter and with more determination. If they do, they un-\ndergo a change (have a \u201cmetamorphosis\u201d) in which they experience the fear that protects them, without losing the aggressiveness\nthat propels them forward. With triumphs come rewards. Though they don\u2019t realize it when they are in their battles, the hero\u2019s\nbiggest reward is what Campbell calls the \u201cboon,\u201d which is the special knowledge about how to succeed that the hero has earned\n\nthrough his journey.\n\f"}, "001329.png": {"text": "RETURNING ADVENTURE\nTHE BOON\n\n \n\nADVENTURE THe THRESHOLD\n\n \n  \n \n \n\nTH ETAT TH E H ERO\u2019'S\nJOURNEY\n\nMETAMORPHOSIS\n\n\u2122 ABYSS\n\nJoseph Campbell\u2019s Hero's Journey schema from The Hero with a Thousand Faces (New World Library), copyright \u00a9 2008 by the Joseph Campbell Foundation (jcf.ore),\n\nused with permission.\n\f"}, "001330.png": {"text": "Late in life, winning more battles and acquiring more rewards typically becomes less exciting to heroes than passing along that\nknowledge to others\u2014\u201creturning the boon\u201d as Campbell called it. Once the boon is returned, the hero is free to live and then free\nto die, or, as I see it, to transition from the second phase in life to the third phase (in which one is free to savor life until one passes\naway).\n\nReading Campbell, I saw that heroes, like shapers, come in varying sizes\u2014there are big ones and small ones\u2014that they are real\npeople, and that we all know some. I also saw that being a hero is typically not all it\u2019s cracked up to be\u2014they get beat up a lot, and\nmany are attacked, humiliated, or killed even after they triumph. In fact, it\u2019s hard to see the logic for choosing this hero role, if one\nwere to choose. But I could see and relate to how a certain type of person would start and stay on that path.\n\nWhile Campbell\u2019s description of the hero\u2019s journey captured the essence of my own journey through life and the journeys of\nmany of the people I call shapers, \u201chero\u201d is not a word that I would use to describe myself and I certainly would not put my own\naccomplishments on the level of the heroes Campbell wrote about.\u2019 But learning about the hero\u2019s journey did help me crystallize\nmy understanding of where I was in my own journey, and what I should do next. The section on returning the boon spoke to me in\na personal way, as though Campbell knew exactly what I was wrestling with. With the reflections it prompted, I could see that my\nlife would be over in a relatively short time and that what I'd leave behind could be more important, last longer, and affect many\nmore people than just those at Bridgewater and my family. That helped make clear that I needed to pass along the things I had that\ncould help others beyond me, most importantly the principles in this book, but also my money.\n\nAs the saying goes, \u201cYou can\u2019t take it with you.\u201d My need to start thinking about who should get what wasn\u2019t just because of\nmy age and the time it would take to do it well; it was also instinctive. Over time, the circle of people and things I cared about had\n\nbroadened from just me when I was young, to me and my family when I became a parent, to my community when I was a bit more\n\nmature, to people beyond my community and the whole environment now.\n\nWRESTLING WITH THE QUESTIONS OF PHILANTHROPY\n\f"}, "001331.png": {"text": "My first exposure to \u201cphilanthropy\u201d\" occurred back in the late 1990s when I was approaching fifty. At that time, Matt was sixteen,\nspoke Mandarin, and visited a Chinese orphanage to help someone, where he learned that a $500 surgery could save or radically\nimprove some lives. We and our friends gave him money to help. Then, my friend Paul Tudor Jones taught Matt how to create a\n501(c)(3) foundation and Matt, just a junior in high school, created the China Care Foundation in 2000. Matt brought our family to\nthe orphanages, so we had close contact with these special-needs children and fell in love with them. We also watched Matt strug-\ngle to decide which children would live and which would die because there wasn\u2019t enough money to save them all. Imagine being\nfaced with the choice between a big night out on the town or saving a child\u2019s life. That was essentially the choice we constantly\nfaced. This experience led us to become more involved with philanthropy, so in 2003 we set up our own foundation to provide sup-\nport in more organized ways. We wanted to do our philanthropy together, as a family activity, which has proven to be fabulous.\n\nFiguring out how to best give away money is as complex an undertaking as figuring out how to make it. Though we now know a\nlot more about it than we did when we started, we still don\u2019t always feel capable to make the best decisions possible, so my family\nand Lare still feeling our way through it. I will give you a few examples of the questions we have been wrestling with and how our\nthinking about them has evolved, starting with the question of how much money should be saved for my family relative to how\nmuch should go to people and causes that are more distant, yet more desperately in need.\n\nLong before I had a lot of money, I had determined that I wanted my sons to have only enough to afford excellent health care, ex-\ncellent education, and an initial boost to help their careers get started. My perspective was influenced by my own journey through\nlife, which took me from having nothing to having a lot. That taught me to struggle well and made me strong. I wanted the same\nfor the people I loved. So, when I had earned a lot of money, I felt I had plenty of money to give away to others.\n\nOver time, as we gained experience in trying to help in a number of areas, I learned how fast money goes and that we didn\u2019t\nhave nearly enough to take care of everything we cared about. Additionally, when my first grandchild was born, it prompted me\nto wonder how many generations I should budget to protect. Speaking to others in comparable positions, I discovered that even\n\nthe richest people feel short of the money they need to do the things they want to do. So I studied how other families approach the\n\f"}, "001332.png": {"text": "question of how much to set aside for family and how much to give away at what pace. While our family still has not answered\nthese questions definitely, I know that I personally will give more than half of my money to those beyond my family.\n\nWhich causes we should donate to was another big question. Barbara\u2019s biggest passion has been helping students in the most\nstressed public school districts in Connecticut, especially those students who are called \u201cdisengaged and disconnected.\u201d2 A study\nshe funded showed that 22 percent of high school students fall into one of these two categories, which was shocking because most\nwill probably become adults who will suffer and be burdens on society rather than flourishing contributors to it. Because she has\na lot of direct contact with these children and their teachers, she understands their needs. When she learned that 10,000 of them\ndidn\u2019t have winter coats, she felt compelled to provide them. What she showed me opened my eyes. How can clothing and nutri-\ntion be so severely deficient in this \u201cland of opportunity\u201d? Everyone in our family believes that equal opportunity, which is one\nof the most fundamental human rights, requires equal educational opportunity\u2014and that educational opportunities are terribly\nunequal. The economic costs\u2014in the forms of crime and incarceration\u2014as well as the social costs of not investing in improving\nthese conditions are immense. While we have felt compelled to help, we\u2019ve discovered it is very difficult to have a significant im-\npact relative to the size of the problem.\n\nI feel deeply connected to nature, especially the oceans. The oceans are our world\u2019s greatest asset, covering 72 percent of its\nsurface and comprising 99 percent of its livable space. It thrills me to support scientists who are exploring the oceans and media\nshowing them in the incredible environments they visit. I\u2019m on a mission to make clear that ocean exploration is even more im-\nportant and exciting than space exploration so that our oceans get more support and will be more sensibly managed. To add to my\nexcitement, my son Mark is a wildlife filmmaker who shares my passion, so we get to pursue it together.\n\nMatt\u2019s passion is to bring inexpensive, effective computing to the developing world as a way of expanding and improving educa-\ntion and health care. Paul\u2019s passion is mental health and his wife\u2019s is fighting climate change. Devon is more focused on his career\nthan on philanthropy now, but his wife cares deeply about animal welfare. Our family continues to support special-needs children\n\nin China, as well as an institute that teaches best practices to Chinese philanthropists. We also support the teaching of meditation\n\f"}, "001333.png": {"text": "to children in stressful environments and to veterans with PTSD, cutting-edge heart research, microfinance and other social enter-\nprises, and much more.\n\nWe view our donations as investments and want to make sure that we have high philanthropic returns on our money. So an-\nother big question we wrestle with is how to measure those returns. It\u2019s much easier to measure efficiency in a business by seeing\nhow much its revenue exceeds its cost. Because of this, we developed an attraction to sustainable social enterprises. Still, I saw\nthat so many philanthropic investments could pay off economically as well as socially, and it tormented me that our society passes\nthem up.\n\nWe also wrestled with how big our organization should be and what governance controls we should have in order to ensure the\nquality of our philanthropic decision making. I approached these decisions the same way I explain in Work Principles\u2014by creating\nformalized principles and policies for our decision making. For example, because we are bombarded with more requests for grants\nthan we can intelligently look at, I mandated a policy not to review unsolicited requests so our staff has the time to sort through\nthe areas we want to be focused on. We are continuously improving all our principles and policies, and I dream about building de-\ncision-making algorithms for our philanthropic efforts, though that\u2019s beyond my reach at the moment.\n\nAs you might have guessed, we also seek advice from the most experienced and respected people possible. Bill Gates and the\npeople we met through our participation in his, Melinda Gates\u2019s, and Warren Buffett\u2019s Giving Pledge have been enlightening. Oth-\ners such as Muhammad Yunus, Paul Jones, Jeff Skoll, the Omidyar folks, and the people at TED have been very helpful. The most\nimportant thing we\u2019ve learned is that there\u2019s no one right way to do philanthropy, though there are plenty of wrong ways.\n\nGiving away the money that I acquired during my lifetime\u2014and doing that well\u2014has been a joy, a challenge, and the appropri-\n\nate thing to do at this stage in my life.\n\nBRIDGEWATER TURNS FORTY\n\f"}, "001334.png": {"text": "InJune 2015, Bridgewater marked its fortieth anniversary, an amazing milestone we celebrated by throwing a big party.

While the investment part of Bridgewater\nwas better than ever, other parts of the business, like the technology and recruiting areas, were slipping.\n\nIwas no longer CEO, so it was not my job to manage the company. As chairman, my job was to oversee the CEOs, to make sure\nthat they were managing it well. And Greg Jensen and Eileen Murray, the CEOs at the time, were clearly overstretched.

That is why we have\nprinciples and processes for resolving them.\n\nSo, over a period of several weeks, we exchanged our views.

The pain of this failure was made worse, especially for Greg, by the\nsensational and inaccurate accounts that appeared in the media.

So I began to think about governance in a way that I never had\nbefore.\n\nSimply put, governance is the system of checks and balances ensuring that an organization will be stronger than whoever\nhappens to be leading it at any one time. Because I was a founder-entrepreneur, I had run Bridgewater for thirty-five years with no\nformal rules to check and balance me (though I had created an informal governance system by having me report to our Manage-\nment Committee as a check on my decision making).\n\nWhile that informal system had worked for me, it could not work well without me. Clearly, we needed to build a new gover-\nnance system that would allow Bridgewater to retain its unique way of being and its uncompromising standards no matter who\nwas in charge\u2014and build it to be resilient enough to change the company\u2019s management if that was required. I went on to do that\nwith the help of others, and we are doing that still.\n\nThad learned that it\u2019s wrong to assume either that a person in one role will be successful in another role or that the ways one\nperson operates will work well for another. This difficult year also taught me a lot about the people around me, especially David\nMcCormick and Eileen Murray, who showed their commitments to our shared mission, as numerous other people did. There were\nsome failures that we would have rather not had, but that was to be expected, given our unique culture of trial and error and learn-\ning from mistakes. Thanks to the changes we put into place, I was able to step out of my temporary stint as CEO after one year, in\nApril 2017.\n\nAs I write these words in 2017, I view this year as the final one in my transition from the second phase of my life to the third,\nwhen I will have finished passing along the knowledge I have gathered along the way, and, as Joseph Campbell described it, I will\nbe free to live and free to die. But right now I\u2019m not thinking about the dying part; I\u2019m thinking about how to live freely, and I\u2019m ex-\n\ncited about it.\n\f"}, "001339.png": {"text": "CHAPTER 8\n\nLOOKING BACK FROM A HIGHER LEVEL\n\nAs I look back on my experiences, it\u2019s interesting to reflect on how my perspectives have changed.\n\nWhen I started out, each and every twist and turn I encountered, whether in the markets or in my life in general, looked really\nbig and dramatic up close, like unique life-or-death experiences that were coming at me fast.\n\nWith time and experience, I came to see each encounter as \u201canother one of those\u201d that I could approach more calmly and analyt-\nically, like a biologist might approach an encounter with a threatening creature in the jungle: first identifying its species and then,\ndrawing on his prior knowledge about its expected behaviors, reacting appropriately. When I was faced with types of situations I\nhad encountered before, I drew on the principles I had learned for dealing with them. But when I ran into ones I hadn\u2019t seen before,\nI would be painfully surprised. Studying all those painful first-time encounters, I learned that even if they hadn\u2019t happened to me,\nmost of them had happened to other people in other times and places, which gave me a healthy respect for history, a hunger to\nhave a universal understanding of how reality works, and the desire to build timeless and universal principles for dealing with it.\n\nWatching the same things happen again and again, I began to see reality as a gorgeous perpetual motion machine, in which\ncauses become effects that become causes of new effects, and so on. I realized that reality was, if not perfect, at least what we are\ngiven to deal with, so that any problems or frustrations I had with it were more productively directed to dealing with them effec-\ntively than complaining about them. I came to understand that my encounters were tests of my character and creativity. Over\ntime, I came to appreciate what a tiny and short-lived part of that remarkable system I am, and how it\u2019s both good for me and good\n\nfor the system for me to know how to interact with it well.\n\f"}, "001340.png": {"text": "In gaining this perspective, I began to experience painful moments in a radically different way. Instead of feeling frustrated or\noverwhelmed, I saw pain as nature\u2019s reminder that there is something important for me to learn. Encountering pains and figuring\nout the lessons they were trying to give me became sort of a game to me. The more I played it, the better I got at it, the less painful\nthose situations became, and the more rewarding the process of reflecting, developing principles, and then getting rewards for\nusing those principles became. I learned to love my struggles, which I suppose is a healthy perspective to have, like learning to love\nexercising (which I haven\u2019t managed to do yet).\n\nIn my early years, I looked up to extraordinarily successful people, thinking that they were successful because they were extra-\nordinary. After I got to know such people personally, I realized that all of them\u2014like me, like everyone\u2014make mistakes, struggle\nwith their weaknesses, and don\u2019t feel that they are particularly special or great. They are no happier than the rest of us, and they\nstruggle just as much or more than average folks. Even after they surpass their wildest dreams, they still experience more struggle\nthan glory. This has certainly been true for me. While I surpassed my wildest dreams decades ago, I am still struggling today. In\ntime, I realized that the satisfaction of success doesn\u2019t come from achieving your goals, but from struggling well. To understand\nwhat I mean, imagine your greatest goal, whatever it is\u2014making a ton of money, winning an Academy Award, running a great\norganization, being great at a sport. Now imagine instantaneously achieving it. You'd be happy at first, but not for long. You would\nsoon find yourself needing something else to struggle for. Just look at people who attain their dreams early\u2014the child star, the lot-\ntery winner, the professional athlete who peaks early. They typically don\u2019t end up happy unless they get excited about something\nelse bigger and better to struggle for. Since life brings both ups and downs, struggling well doesn\u2019t just make your ups better; it\nmakes your downs less bad. I\u2019m still struggling and I will until I die, because even if I try to avoid the struggles, they will find me.\n\nThanks to all that struggling and learning, I have done everything I wanted to do, gone everywhere I wanted to go, met\nwhomever I wanted to meet, gotten everything I wanted to own, had a career that has been enthralling, and, most rewardingly,\nhad many wonderful relationships. I have experienced the full range, from having nothing to having an enormous amount, and\nfrom being a nobody to being a somebody, so I know the differences. While I experienced them going from the bottom up rather\n\nthan from the top down (which was preferable and probably influenced my perspective), my assessment is that the incremental\n\f"}, "001341.png": {"text": "benefits of having a lot and being on top are not nearly as great as most people think.

And the people one meets at the top aren\u2019t necessarily more special than those one\nmeets at the bottom or in between.\n\nThe marginal benefits of having more fall off pretty quickly. In fact, having a lot more is worse than having a moderate amount\nmore because it comes with heavy burdens. Being on top gives you a wider range of options, but it also requires more of you. Being\nwell-known is probably worse than being anonymous, all things considered. And while the beneficial impact one can have on oth-\ners is great, when you put it in perspective, it is still infinitesimally small. For all those reasons, I cannot say that having an intense\nlife filled with accomplishments is better than having a relaxed life filled with savoring, though I can say that being strong is better\nthan being weak, and that struggling gives one strength. My nature being what it is, I would not have changed my life, but I can\u2019t\ntell you what is best for you. That is for you to choose. What I have seen is that the happiest people discover their own nature and\nmatch their life to it.\n\nNow that my desire to succeed has given way to a desire to help others succeed, that\u2019s become my current struggle.

The key\n\nis to know which path will yield better results.\u201c I believe that:\n\na. Radical open-mindedness and radical transparency are invaluable for rapid learning and effective change. Learning is the product of a continuous real-\ntime feedback loop in which we make decisions, see their outcomes, and improve our understanding of reality as a result. Being\nradically open-minded enhances the efficiency of those feedback loops, because it makes what you are doing, and why, so clear to\nyourself and others that there can\u2019t be any misunderstandings. The more open-minded you are, the less likely you are to deceive\nyourself\u2014and the more likely it is that others will give you honest feedback.

It can also be difficult because being\nradically transparent rather than more guarded exposes one to criticism. It\u2019s natural to fear that.

As you'll see, I\u2019ve learned firsthand how powerful this kind of\nradical truth and transparency is in improving my decision making and my relationships.

Man didn\u2019t create these laws, but by understanding them we can use them to\nfoster our own evolution and achieve our goals. For example, our ability to fly or to send cell phone signals around the world came\n\nfrom understanding and applying the existing rules of reality\u2014the physical laws or principles that govern the natural world.\n\f"}, "001351.png": {"text": "While I spend most of my time studying the realities that affect me most directly\u2014those that drive economies, the markets, and\nthe people I deal with\u2014I also spend time in nature and can\u2019t help reflecting on how it works by observing, reading, and speaking\nwith some of the greatest specialists on the subject. I\u2019ve found it both interesting and valuable to observe which laws we humans\nhave in common with the rest of nature and which differentiate us. Doing that has had a big impact on my approach to life.\n\nFirst of all, I see how cool it is that the brain\u2019s evolution gave us the ability to reflect on how reality works in this way. Man\u2019s\nmost distinctive quality is our singular ability to look down on reality from a higher perspective and synthesize an understanding\nof it. While other species operate by following their instincts, man alone can go above himself and look at himself within his cir-\ncumstances and within time (including before and after his existence). For example, we can ponder the ways that nature\u2019s flying\nmachines, swimming machines, and billions of other machines, from the microscopic to the cosmic, interact with one another to\nmake up a working whole that evolves through time. This is because the evolution of the brain gave man a much more developed\nneocortex, which gives us the power to think abstractly and logically.\n\nWhile our higher-level thinking makes us unique among species, it can also make us uniquely confused. Other species have\nmuch simpler and more straightforward lives, without any of man\u2019s wrestling with what\u2019s good and what's bad. In contrast with\nanimals, most people struggle to reconcile their emotions and their instincts (which come from the animal parts of their brains)\nwith their reasoning (which comes from parts of the brain more developed in humans). This struggle causes people to confuse\nwhat they want to be true with what actually is true. Let\u2019s look at this dilemma to try to understand how reality works.\n\nWhen trying to understand anything\u2014economies, markets, the weather, whatever\u2014one can approach the subject with two\n\nperspectives:\n\n1. Top down: By trying to find the one code/law that drives them all. For example, in the case of markets, one could study univer-\nsal laws like supply and demand that affect all economies and markets. In the case of species, one could focus on learning\n\nhow the genetic code (DNA) works for all species.\n\f"}, "001352.png": {"text": "2. Bottom up: By studying each specific case and the codes/laws that are true for them, for example, the codes or laws particular\n\nto the market for wheat or the DNA sequences that make ducks different from other species.\n\nSeeing things from the top down is the best way to understand ourselves and the laws of reality within the context of overarch-\ning universal laws. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not worth having a bottom-up perspective. In fact, to understand the world accurately you\nneed both. By taking a bottom-up perspective that looks at each individual case, we can see how it lines up with our theories about\nthe laws that we expect to govern it. When they line up, we're good.\n\nBy looking at nature from the top down, we can see that much of what we call human nature is really animal nature. That\u2019s\nbecause the human brain is programmed with millions of years of genetic learning that we share with other species. Because we\nshare common roots and common laws, we and other animals have similar attributes and constraints. For example, the male/\nfemale sexual reproduction process, using two eyes to provide depth perception, and many other systems are shared by many\nspecies in the animal kingdom. Similarly, our brains have some \u201canimal\u201d parts that are much older in evolutionary terms than\nhumanity is. These laws that we have in common are the most overarching ones. They wouldn't be apparent to us if we just looked\nat ourselves.\n\nIf you just looked at one species\u2014ducks, for example\u2014to try to understand the universal laws, you'd fail. Similarly, if you just\nlooked at mankind to understand the universal laws, you'd fail. Man is just one of ten million species and just one of the billions of\nmanifestations of the forces that bring together and take apart atoms through time. Yet most people are like ants focused only on\nthemselves and their own anthill; they believe the universe revolves around people and don\u2019t pay attention to the universal laws\nthat are true for all species.\n\nTo try to figure out the universal laws of reality and principles for dealing with it, I\u2019ve found it helpful to try to look at things\nfrom nature's perspective. While mankind is very intelligent in relation to other species, we have the intelligence of moss growing\n\non a rock compared to nature as a whole. We are incapable of designing and building a mosquito, let alone all the species and most\n\f"}, "001353.png": {"text": "of the other things in the universe.

It\u2019s important not to let our biases stand\nin the way of our objectivity. To get good results, we need to be analytical rather than emotional.\n\nWhenever I observe something in nature that I (or mankind) think is wrong, I assume that J\u2019m wrong and try to figure out why\nwhat nature is doing makes sense.

Would the world be a better or\nworse place if what I\u2019d seen hadn\u2019t occurred? That perspective drove me to consider the second- and third-order consequences so\nthat I could see that the world would be worse. I now realize that nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual, but most\npeople judge good and bad based only on how it affects them. What I had seen was the process of nature at work, which is much\nmore effective at furthering the improvement of the whole than any process man has ever invented.\n\nMost people call something bad if it is bad for them or bad for those they empathize with, ignoring the greater good. This\ntendency extends to groups: One religion will consider its beliefs good and another religion's beliefs bad to such an extent that\ntheir members might kill each other in the mutual conviction that each is doing what\u2019s right. Typically, people's conflicting beliefs\nor conflicting interests make them unable to see things through another\u2019s eyes. That\u2019s not good and it doesn\u2019t make sense. While I\ncould understand people liking something that helps them and disliking things that hurt them, it doesn\u2019t make sense to call some-\n\nthing good or bad in an absolute sense based only on how it affects individuals.

To be \u201cgood\u201d something must operate consistently with the laws of reality and contribute to the evolution of the whole; that is what is most rewarded. For example, if\nyou come up with something the world values, you almost can\u2019t help but be rewarded. Conversely, reality tends to penalize those\n\npeople, species, and things that don\u2019t work well and detract from evolution.\u201d\nIn looking at what is true for everything, I have come to believe that:\n\nc. Evolution is the single greatest force in the universe; it is the only thing that is permanent and it drives everything..\u00b0 Everything from the smallest subatomic\nparticle to the entire galaxy is evolving. While everything apparently dies or disappears in time, the truth is that it all just gets\nreconfigured in evolving forms. Remember that energy can\u2019t be destroyed\u2014it can only be reconfigured. So the same stuff is contin-\nuously falling apart and coalescing in different forms. The force behind that is evolution.\n\nFor example, the primary purpose of every living thing is to act as a vessel for the DNA that evolves life through time. The DNA\nthat exists within each individual came from an eternity ago and will continue to live long after its individual carriers pass away,\nin increasingly evolved forms.2\n\nAs I thought about evolution, I realized that it exists in other forms than life and is carried out through other transmission\nmechanisms than DNA. Technologies, languages, and everything else evolves. Knowledge, for example, is like DNA in that it is\npassed from generation to generation and evolves; its impact on people over many generations can be as great or greater than that\nof the genetic code.\n\nEvolution is good because it is the process of adaptation that generally moves things toward improvement. All things such as\nproducts, organizations, and human capabilities evolve through time in a similar way. It is simply the process by which things ei-\n\nther adapt and improve or die. To me this evolutionary process looks like what you see on the right:\n\f"}, "001355.png": {"text": " \n\f"}, "001356.png": {"text": " \n\f"}, "001357.png": {"text": " \n\nEvolution consists of adaptations/inventions that provide spurts of benefits that decline in value. That painful decline leads\neither to new adaptations and new inventions that bring new products, organizations, and human capabilities to new and higher\nlevels of development (as shown in the top diagram on the facing page); or decline and death, which looks like the diagram at bot-\ntom left.\n\f"}, "001358.png": {"text": "Think of any product, organization, or person you know and you will see that this is true. The world is littered with once-great\nthings that deteriorated and failed; only a rare few have kept reinventing themselves to go on to new heights of greatness. All ma-\nchines eventually break down, decompose, and have their parts recycled to create new machines. That includes us. Sometimes this\nmakes us sad because we've become attached to our machines, but if you look at it from the higher level, it\u2019s really beautiful to ob-\nserve how the machine of evolution works.\n\nFrom this perspective, we can see that perfection doesn\u2019t exist; it is a goal that fuels a never-ending process of adaptation. If\nnature, or anything, were perfect it wouldn't be evolving. Organisms, organizations, and individual people are always highly im-\nperfect but capable of improving. So rather than getting stuck hiding our mistakes and pretending we're perfect, it makes sense\nto find our imperfections and deal with them. You will either learn valuable lessons from your mistakes and press on, better\nequipped to succeed\u2014or you won't and you will fail.\n\nAs the saying goes:\n\nd. Evolve or die. This evolutionary cycle is not just for people but for countries, companies, economies\u2014for everything. And it is natu-\nrally self-correcting as a whole, though not necessarily for its parts. For example, if there is too much supply and waste in a market,\nprices will go down, companies will go out of business, and capacity will be reduced until the supply falls in line with the demand,\nat which time the cycle will start to move in the opposite direction. Similarly, if an economy turns bad enough, those responsible\n\nfor running it will make the political and policy changes that are needed\u2014or they will not survive, making room for their replace-\n\nments to come along. These cycles are continuous and play out in logical ways\u2014and they tend to be self-reinforcing.\n\f"}, "001359.png": {"text": " \n\f"}, "001360.png": {"text": "The key is to fail, learn, and improve quickly.

History has shown that all species will either go extinct or evolve into other\nspecies, though with our limited time window that is hard for us to see. But we do know that what we call mankind was simply the\nresult of DNA evolving into a new form about two hundred thousand years ago, and we know that mankind will certainly either\ngo extinct or evolve into a higher state. I personally believe there is a good chance man will begin to evolve at an accelerating pace\nwith the help of man-made technologies that can analyze vast amounts of data and \u201cthink\u201d faster and better than we can. I wonder\nhow many centuries it will take for us to evolve into a higher-level species that will be much closer to omniscience than we are now\n\u2014if we don\u2019t destroy ourselves first.\n\nOne of the great marvels of nature is how the whole system, which is full of individual organisms acting in their own self-inter-\nest and without understanding or guiding what\u2019s going on, can create a beautifully operating and evolving whole. While I\u2019m not\nan expert at this, it seems that it\u2019s because evolution has produced a) incentives and interactions that lead to individuals pursuing\ntheir own interests and resulting in the advancement of the whole, b) the natural selection process, and c) rapid experimentation\n\nand adaptation.\n\na. The individual's incentives must be aligned with the group's goals. To give you a quick example of nature creating incentives that lead to individu-\n\nals pursuing their own interests that result in the advancement of the whole, look at sex and natural selection. Nature gave us one\n\f"}, "001361.png": {"text": "hell of an incentive to have sex in the form of the great pleasure it provides, even though the purpose of having sex is to contribute\n\nto the advancement of the DNA. That way, we individually get what we want while contributing to the evolution of the whole.\n\nb. Reality is optimizing for the whole\u2014not for you. Contribute to the whole and you will likely be rewarded. Natural selection leads to better\nqualities being retained and passed along (e.g., in better genes, better abilities to nurture others, better products, etc.). The result is\n\naconstant cycle of improvement for the whole.\n\nc. Adaptation through rapid trial and error is invaluable. Natural selection\u2019s trial-and-error process allows improvement without anyone\nunderstanding or guiding it. The same can apply to how we learn. There are at least three kinds of learning that foster evolution:\nmemory-based learning (storing the information that comes in through one\u2019s conscious mind so that we can recall it later); sub-\nconscious learning (the knowledge we take away from our experiences that never enters our conscious minds, though it affects\nour decision making); and \u201clearning\u201d that occurs without thinking at all, such as the changes in DNA that encode a species\u2019 adap-\ntations. I used to think that memory-based, conscious learning was the most powerful, but I\u2019ve since come to understand that\nit produces less rapid progress than experimentation and adaptation. To give you an example of how nature improves without\nthinking, just look at the struggle that mankind (with all its thinking) has experienced in trying to outsmart viruses (which don\u2019t\neven have brains). Viruses are like brilliant chess opponents. By evolving quickly (combining different genetic material across\ndifferent strains), they keep the smartest minds in the global health community busy thinking up countermoves to hold them off.\nUnderstanding that is especially helpful in an era when computers can run large numbers of simulations replicating the evolu-\ntionary process to help us see what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nIn the next chapter I will describe a process that has helped me, and I believe can help you, evolve quickly. But first I want to\n\nemphasize how important your perspective is in trying to decide what is important to you and what to go after.\n\f"}, "001362.png": {"text": "d. Realize that you are simultaneously everything and nothing\u2014and decide what you want to be. It is a great paradox that individually we are simultane-\nously everything and nothing. Through our own eyes, we are everything\u2014e.g., when we die, the whole world disappears. So to\nmost people (and to other species) dying is the worst thing possible, and it is of paramount importance that we have the best life\npossible. However, when we look down on ourselves through the eyes of nature we are of absolutely no significance. It is a reality\nthat each one of us is only one of about seven billion of our species alive today and that our species is only one of about ten million\nspecies on our planet. Earth is just one of about 100 billion planets in our galaxy, which is just one of about two trillion galaxies\nin the universe. And our lifetimes are only about 1/3,000 of humanity's existence, which itself is only 1/20,000 of the Earth\u2019s ex-\nistence. In other words, we are unbelievably tiny and short-lived and no matter what we accomplish, our impact will be insignifi-\ncant. At the same time, we instinctually want to matter and to evolve, and we can matter a tiny bit\u2014and it\u2019s all those tiny bits that\nadd up to drive the evolution of the universe.\n\nThe question is how we matter and evolve. Do we matter to others (who also don\u2019t matter in the grand scope of things) or in\nsome greater sense that we will never actually achieve? Or does it not matter if we matter so we should forget about the question\n\nand just enjoy our lives while they last?\n\ne. What you will be will depend on the perspective you have. Where you go in life will depend on how you see things and who and what you feel\nconnected to (your family, your community, your country, mankind, the whole ecosystem, everything). You will have to decide to\nwhat extent you will put the interests of others above your own, and which others you will choose to do so for. That\u2019s because you\n\nwill regularly encounter situations that will force you to make such choices.\n\nWhile such decisions might seem too erudite for your taste, you will make them either consciously or subliminally, and they will\nbe very important.\nFor me personally, I now find it thrilling to embrace reality, to look down on myself through nature's perspective, and to be an\n\ninfinitesimally small part of the whole.

Most importantly, it has helped me deal\nwith my realities more effectively and make difficult choices. When I began to look at reality through the perspective of figuring\nout how it really works, instead of thinking things should be different, I realized that most everything that at first seemed \u201cbad\u201d\nto me\u2014like rainy days, weaknesses, and even death\u2014was because I held preconceived notions of what I personally wanted. With\ntime, I learned that my initial reaction was because I hadn't put whatever I was reacting to in the context of the fact that reality is\n\nbuilt to optimize for the whole rather than for me.\n\na. Maximize your evolution. Earlier, I mentioned that the unique abilities of thinking logically, abstractly, and from a higher level are\ncarried out in structures located in the neocortex. These parts of the brain are more developed in humans and allow us to reflect on\nourselves and direct our own evolution. Because we are capable of conscious, memory-based learning, we can evolve further and\nfaster than any other species, changing not just across generations but within our own lifetimes.\n\nThis constant drive toward learning and improvement makes getting better innately enjoyable and getting better fast exhilarat-\ning. Though most people think that they are striving to get the things (toys, bigger houses, money, status, etc.) that will make them\nhappy, for most people those things don\u2019t supply anywhere near the long-term satisfaction that getting better at something does.\u201d\nOnce we get the things we are striving for, we rarely remain satisfied with them. The things are just the bait. Chasing after them\n\nforces us to evolve, and it is the evolution and not the rewards themselves that matters to us and to those around us.

Consider what acquiring money is like. People\nwho earn so much that they derive little or no marginal gains from it will experience negative consequences, as with any other\nform of excess, like gluttony. If they are intellectually healthy, they will begin seeking something new or seeking new depths in\nsomething old\u2014and they will get stronger in the process. As Freud put it, \u201cLove and work are the cornerstones of our humanness.\u201d\n\nThe work doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a job, though I believe it\u2019s generally better if it is a job. It can be any kind of long-term\nchallenge that leads to personal improvement. As you might have guessed, I believe that the need to have meaningful work is\nconnected to man\u2019s innate desire to improve. And relationships are the natural connections to others that make us relevant to each\n\nother and to society more broadly.\n\nb.

So what is its purpose?\n\nIt alerts us and helps direct us.\n\nc. Itis a fundamental law of nature that in order to gain strength one has to push one\u2019s limits, which is painful. As Carl Jung put it, \u201cMan needs difficulties.\nThey are necessary for health.\u201d Yet most people instinctually avoid pain. This is true whether we are talking about building the\nbody (e.g., weight lifting) or the mind (e.g., frustration, mental struggle, embarrassment, shame)\u2014and especially true when peo-\n\nple confront the harsh reality of their own imperfections.\n\n1.7 Pain + Reflection = Progress.\n\f"}, "001365.png": {"text": " \n\nThere is no avoiding pain, especially if you\u2019re going after ambitious goals.

If you can develop a reflexive\nreaction to psychic pain that causes you to reflect on it rather than avoid it, it will lead to your rapid learning/evolving.\u2122 After see-\ning how much more effective it is to face the painful realities that are caused by your problems, mistakes, and weaknesses, I believe\nyou won\u2019t want to operate any other way. It\u2019s just a matter of getting in the habit of doing it.\n\nMost people have a tough time reflecting when they are in pain and they pay attention to other things when the pain passes, so\nthey miss out on the reflections that provide the lessons. If you can reflect well while you're in pain (which is probably too much to\nask), great. But if you can remember to reflect after it passes, that\u2019s valuable too. (I created a Pain Button app to help people do this,\nwhich I describe in the appendix.)\n\nThe challenges you face will test and strengthen you.

The fourth path, changing what you are going after, is also a great path, though it requires flexibility on your part to get\n\npast your preconceptions and enjoy the good fit when you find it.\n\n{. Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a great skill that you should develop no matter what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will\n\nprevent you from doing what you shouldn't be doing. All successful people are good at this.\n\ng. Because it is difficult to see oneself objectively, you need to rely on the input of others and the whole body of evidence. I know that my own life has been full\nof mistakes and lots of great feedback. It was only by looking down on this body of evidence from a higher level that I was able to\nget around my mistakes and go after what I wanted. For as long as I have been practicing this, I still know I can\u2019t see myself objec-\n\ntively, which is why I continue to rely so much on the input of others.\n\nh. If you are open-minded enough and determined, you can get virtually anything you want. So I certainly don\u2019t want to dissuade you from going after\nwhatever you want. At the same time, I urge you to reflect on whether what you are going after is consistent with your nature.\nWhatever your nature is, there are many paths that will suit you, so don\u2019t fixate on just one. Should a particular path close, all you\nhave to do is find another good one consistent with what you're like. (You'll learn a lot about how to determine what you're like\nlater, in Understand That People Are Wired Very Differently.)\n\nBut most people lack the courage to confront their own weaknesses and make the hard choices that this process requires. Ulti-\n\nmately, it comes down to the following five decisions:\n\n1. Don't confuse what you wish were true with what is really true.\n2. Don't worry about looking good\u2014worry instead about achieving your goals.\n\n3. Don't overweight first-order consequences relative to second- and third-order ones.\n\f"}, "001374.png": {"text": "4. Don't let pain stand in the way of progress.\n\n5.

While it is up to us to know what we want,\nothers may know how to get it better than we do because they have strengths where we have weaknesses, or more relevant knowledge and experience. For example,\nit's probably better for you to follow your doctor's advice than your own if you have a medical condition.

Let\u2019s look at this process more granularly.\nFirst you have to pick what you are going after\u2014your goals. Your choice of goals will determine your direction. As you move\ntoward them, you will encounter problems. Some of those problems will bring you up against your own weaknesses. How you\n\nreact to the pain that causes is up to you.

To evolve quickly, you will have to do this fast\nand continuously, setting your goals successively higher.\n\nYou will need to do all five steps well to be successful and you must do them one at a time and in order. For example, when\nsetting goals, just set goals. Don\u2019t think about how you will achieve them or what you will do if something goes wrong. When you\nare diagnosing problems, don\u2019t think about how you will solve them\u2014just diagnose them. Blurring the steps leads to suboptimal\noutcomes because it interferes with uncovering the true problems. The process is iterative: Doing each step thoroughly will pro-\nvide you with the information you need to move on to the next step and do it well.\n\nIt is essential that you approach this process in a clearheaded, rational way, looking down on yourself from a higher level and\nbeing ruthlessly honest. If your emotions are getting the better of you, step back and take time out until you can reflect clearly. If\nnecessary, seek guidance from calm, thoughtful people.\n\nTo help you stay centered and effective, pretend that your life is a martial art or a game, the object of which is to get arounda\nchallenge and reach a goal. Once you accept its rules, you'll get used to the discomfort that comes with the constant frustration.\nYou will never handle everything perfectly: Mistakes are inevitable and it\u2019s important to recognize and accept this fact of life. The\ngood news is that every mistake you make can teach you something, so there\u2019s no end to learning.

Don\u2019t worry about it because that\u2019s true for everyone. You just have\n\n \n\n1 GOALS\n\n4 DESIGN\n\nto know when they are needed and where you can go to get them. With practice, you will eventually play this game with a calm un-\nstoppable centeredness in the face of adversity. Your ability to get what you want will thrill you.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at how to approach each of the five steps.\n\n2.1 Have clear goals.\n\f"}, "001384.png": {"text": "a. Prioritize: While you can have virtually anything you want, you can't have everything you want. Life is like a giant smorgasbord with more delicious alter-\nnatives than you can ever hope to taste. Choosing a goal often means rejecting some things you want in order to get other things\nthat you want or need even more. Some people fail at this point, before they\u2019ve even started. Afraid to reject a good alternative for\na better one, they try to pursue too many goals at once, achieving few or none of them. Don\u2019t get discouraged and don\u2019t let yourself\n\nbe paralyzed by all the choices. You can have much more than what you need to be happy. Make your choice and get on with it.\n\nb. Don't confuse goals with desires. A proper goal is something that you really need to achieve. Desires are things that you want that can\nprevent you from reaching your goals. Typically, desires are first-order consequences. For example, your goal might be physical\nfitness, while your desire is to eat good-tasting but unhealthy food. Don\u2019t get me wrong, if you want to be a couch potato, that\u2019s fine\nwith me. You can pursue whatever goals you want. But if you don\u2019t want to be a couch potato, then you better not open that bag of\n\nchips.\n\nc. Decide what you really want in life by reconciling your goals and your desires. Take passion, for example. Without passion, life would be dull; you\nwouldn't want to live without it. But what\u2019s key is what you do with your passion. Do you let it consume you and drive you to ir-\nrational acts, or do you harness it to motivate and drive you while you pursue your real goals? What will ultimately fulfill you are\n\nthings that feel right at both levels, as both desires and goals.\n\nd. Don't mistake the trappings of success for success itself. Achievement orientation is important, but people who obsess over a $1,200 pair\nof shoes or a fancy car are very rarely happy because they don\u2019t know what it is that they really want and hence what will satisfy\n\nthem.\n\ne. Never rule out a goal because you think it\u2019s unattainable. Be audacious. There is always a best possible path. Your job is to find it and have the\n\ncourage to follow it. What you think is attainable is just a function of what you know at the moment. Once you start your pursuit\n\f"}, "001385.png": {"text": "you will learn a lot, especially if you triangulate with others; paths you never saw before will emerge. Of course there are some\nimpossibilities or near-impossibilities, such as playing center on a professional basketball team if you're short, or running a four-\n\nminute mile at age seventy.\n\nf. Remember that great expectations create great capabilities. If you limit your goals to what you know you can achieve, you are setting the bar\n\nway too low.\n\ng. Almost nothing can stop you from succeeding if you have a) flexibility and b) self-accountability. Flexibility is what allows you to accept what reality (or\nknowledgeable people) teaches you; self-accountability is essential because if you really believe that failing to achieve a goal is your\npersonal failure, you will see your failing to achieve it as indicative that you haven't been creative or flexible or determined enough\n\nto do what it takes. And you will be that much more motivated to find the way.\n\nh. Knowing how to deal well with your setbacks is as important as knowing how to move forward. Sometimes you know that you are going over a waterfall\nand there is no way to avoid it. Life will throw you such challenges, some of which will seem devastating at the time. In bad times,\nyour goal might be to keep what you have, to minimize your rate of loss, or simply to deal with a loss that is irrevocable. Your mis-\n\nsion is to always make the best possible choices, knowing that you will be rewarded if you do.\n\n2.2 Identify and don't tolerate problems.\n\na. View painful problems as potential improvements that are screaming at you. Though it won't feel that way at first, each and every problem you\n\nencounter is an opportunity; for that reason, it is essential that you bring them to the surface. Most people don't like to do this,\n\f"}, "001386.png": {"text": "especially if it exposes their own weaknesses or the weaknesses of someone they care about, but successful people know they have\n\nto.\n\nb. Don't avoid confronting problems because they are rooted in harsh realities that are unpleasant to look at. Thinking about problems that are difficult to\nsolve may make you anxious, but not thinking about them (and hence not dealing with them) should make you more anxious still.\nWhen a problem stems from your own lack of talent or skill, most people feel shame. Get over it. I cannot emphasize this enough:\nAcknowledging your weaknesses is not the same as surrendering to them. It\u2019s the first step toward overcoming them. The pains\n\nyou are feeling are \u201cgrowing pains\u201d that will test your character and reward you as you push through them.\n\nc. Be specific in identifying your problems. You need to be precise, because different problems have different solutions. If a problem is due to\ninadequate skill, additional training may be called for; if it arises from an innate weakness, you may need to seek assistance from\nsomeone else or change the role you play. In other words, if you're bad at accounting, hire an accountant. If a problem stems from\n\nsomeone else\u2019s weaknesses, replace them with someone who is strong where it\u2019s needed. That\u2019s just the way it is.\n\nd. Don't mistake a cause of a problem with the real problem. \u201cI can\u2019t get enough sleep\u201d is not a problem; it is a potential cause (or perhaps the\nresult) of a problem. To clarify your thinking, try to identify the bad outcome first; e.g., \u201cIam performing poorly in my job.\u201d Not\nsleeping enough may be the cause of that problem, or the cause may be something else\u2014but in order to determine that, you need\n\nto know exactly what the problem is.\n\ne. Distinguish big problems from small ones. You only have so much time and energy; make sure you are investing them in exploring the\nproblems that, if fixed, will yield you the biggest returns. But at the same time, make sure you spend enough time with the small\n\nproblems to make sure they\u2019re not symptoms of larger ones.\n\f"}, "001387.png": {"text": "f. Once you identify a problem, don\u2019t tolerate it. Tolerating a problem has the same consequences as failing to identify it. Whether you tolerate\nit because you believe it cannot be solved, because you don\u2019t care enough to solve it, or because you can\u2019t muster enough of what-\never it takes to solve it, if you don\u2019t have the will to succeed, then your situation is hopeless. You need to develop a fierce intolerance\n\nof badness of any kind, regardless of its severity.\n\n2.3 Diagnose problems to get at their root causes.\n\na. Focus on the \u201cwhat is\u201d before deciding \u201cwhat to do about it.\u201d It is acommon mistake to move in a nanosecond from identifying a tough problem\nto proposing a solution for it. Strategic thinking requires both diagnosis and design. A good diagnosis typically takes between\nfifteen minutes and an hour, depending on how well it\u2019s done and how complex the issue is. It involves speaking with the relevant\npeople and looking at the evidence together to determine the root causes. Like principles, root causes manifest themselves over\n\nand over again in seemingly different situations. Finding them and dealing with them pays dividends again and again.\n\nb. Distinguish proximate causes from root causes. Proximate causes are typically the actions (or lack of actions) that lead to problems, so they\nare described with verbs (I missed the train because I didn\u2019t check the train schedule). Root causes run much deeper and they are typ-\nically described with adjectives (I didn\u2019t check the train schedule because I am forgetful). You can only truly solve your problems by\n\nremoving their root causes, and to do that, you must distinguish the symptoms from the disease.\n\nc. Recognize that knowing what someone (including you) is like will tell you what you can expect from them. You will have to get over your reluctance to\nassess what people are like if you want to surround yourself with people who have the qualities you need. That goes for yourself\n\ntoo. People almost always find it difficult to identify and accept their own mistakes and weaknesses. Sometimes it\u2019s because\n\f"}, "001388.png": {"text": "they\u2019re blind to them, but more often it\u2019s because their egos get in the way. Most likely your associates are equally reluctant to point\nout your mistakes, because they don\u2019t want to hurt you. You all need to get over this. More than anything else, what differentiates\npeople who live up to their potential from those who don\u2019t is their willingness to look at themselves and others objectively and un-\n\nderstand the root causes standing in their way.\n\n2.4 Design a plan.\n\na. Go back before you go forward. Replay the story of where you have been (or what you have done) that led up to where you are now, and\n\nthen visualize what you and others must do in the future so you will reach your goals.\n\nb. Think about your problem as a set of outcomes produced by a machine. Practice higher-level thinking by looking down on your machine and\n\nthinking about how it can be changed to produce better outcomes.\n\nc. Remember that there are typically many paths to achieving your goals. You only need to find one that works.\n\nd. Think of your plan as being like a movie script in that you visualize who will do what through time. Sketch out the plan broadly at first (e.g., \u201chire great\n\npeople\u201d) and then refine it. You should go from the big picture and drill down to specific tasks and estimated time lines (e.g., \u201cIn the\nnext two weeks, choose the headhunters who will find those great people\u201d). The real-world issues of costs, time, and personnel will\nundoubtedly surface as you do this, and that will lead you to further refine your design until all the gears in the machine are mesh-\n\ning smoothly.\n\f"}, "001389.png": {"text": "e. Write down your plan for everyone to see and to measure your progress against. This includes all the granular details about who needs to do what\ntasks and when. The tasks, the narrative, and the goals are different, so don\u2019t mix them up. Remember, the tasks are what connect\n\nthe narrative to your goals.\n\nf. Recognize that it doesn't take a lot of time to design a good plan. A plan can be sketched out and refined in just hours or spread out over days\nor weeks. But the process is essential because it determines what you will have to do to be effective. Too many people make the\nmistake of spending virtually no time on designing because they are preoccupied with execution. Remember: Designing precedes\n\ndoing!\n\n2.5 Push through to completion.\n\na. Great planners who don't execute their plans go nowhere. You need to push through and that requires self-discipline to follow your script. It\u2019s\nimportant to remember the connections between your tasks and the goals that they are meant to achieve. When you feel yourself\n\nlosing sight of that, stop and ask yourself \u201cwhy?\u201d Lose sight of the why and you will surely lose sight of your goals.\n\nb. Good work habits are vastly underrated. People who push through successfully have to-do lists that are reasonably prioritized, and they\n\nmake certain each item is ticked off in order.\n\nc. Establish clear metrics to make certain that you are following your plan. Ideally, someone other than you should be objectively measuring and\nreporting on your progress. If you're not hitting your targets, that\u2019s another problem that needs to be diagnosed and solved. There\nare many successful, creative people who aren\u2019t good at execution. They succeed because they forge symbiotic relationships with\n\nhighly reliable task-doers.\n\f"}, "001390.png": {"text": "That\u2019s all there is to it!\n\nRemember that all 5 Steps proceed from your values. Your values determine what you want, i.e., your goals. Also keep in mind\nthat the 5 Steps are iterative. When you complete one step, you will have acquired information that will most likely lead you to\nmodify the other steps. When you've completed all five, you'll start again with a new goal. If the process is working, your goals will\nchange more slowly than your designs, which will change more slowly than your tasks.\n\nOne last important point: You will need to synthesize and shape well. The first three steps\u2014setting goals, identifying problems,\nand then diagnosing them\u2014are synthesizing (by which I mean knowing where you want to go and what\u2019s really going on). Design-\n\ning solutions and making sure that the designs are implemented are shaping.\n\n2.6 Remember that weaknesses don't matter if you find solutions.\n\nYou almost certainly can\u2019t do all these steps well, because each requires different types of thinking and virtually nobody can think\nwell in all these ways. For example, goal setting (such as determining what you want your life to be) requires you to be good at\nhigher-level thinking like visualization and prioritization. Identifying and not tolerating problems requires you to be perceptive\nand good at synthesis and maintaining high standards; diagnosis requires you to be logical, able to see multiple possibilities, and\nwilling to have hard conversations with others; designing requires visualization and practicality; doing what you set out to do re-\nquires self-discipline, good work habits, and a results orientation. Who do you know who has all those qualities? Probably no one.\nYet doing all 5 Steps well is required for being really successful. So what do you do? First and foremost, have humility so you can get\nwhat you need from others!\n\nEveryone has weaknesses. They are generally revealed in the patterns of mistakes they make. Knowing what your weaknesses\n\nare and staring hard at them is the first step on the path to success.\n\f"}, "001391.png": {"text": "a. Look at the patterns of your mistakes and identify at which step in the 5-Step Process you typically fail. Ask others for their input too, as nobody can be\n\nfully objective about themselves.\n\nb. Everyone has at least one big thing that stands in the way of their success; find yours and deal with it. Write down what your one big thing is (such as\nidentifying problems, designing solutions, pushing through to results) and why it exists (your emotions trip you up, you can\u2019t\nvisualize adequate possibilities). While you and most people probably have more than one major impediment, if you can remove or\nget around that one really big one, you will hugely improve your life. If you work on it, you will almost certainly be able to deal suc-\ncessfully with your one big thing.\n\nYou can either fix it or you can get the help of others to deal with it well. There are two paths to success: 1) to have what you need\nyourself or 2) to get it from others. The second path requires you to have humility. Humility is as important, or even more impor-\n\ntant, as having the strengths yourself. Having both is best. On the following page is a template that some people find helpful.\n\n2.7 Understand your own and others\u2019 mental maps and humility.\n\nSome people are good at knowing what to do on their own; they have good mental maps.

Humility can be even more\nvaluable than having good mental maps if it leads you to seek out better answers than you could come up with on your own. Hav-\ning both open-mindedness and good mental maps is most powerful of all.\n\nTo convey this simple concept, imagine rating from one to ten how good someone's mental map is (in other words, what they\n\nknow) on the Y-axis and how humble/open-minded they are on the X-axis, as shown on the opposite page.\n\f"}, "001392.png": {"text": "Everyone starts out in the lower left area, with poor mental maps and little open-mindedness, and most people remain tragi-\ncally and arrogantly stuck in that position.

If you have good\nmental maps and low open-mindedness, that will be good but not great. You will still miss a lot that is of value. Similarly, if you\nhave high open-mindedness but bad mental maps, you will probably have challenges picking the right people and points of view\nto follow.

They make you defen-\nsive, especially when it comes to the subject of how good you are.\n\nAt the same time, higher-level consciousness resides in your neocortex, more specifically in the part called the prefrontal cortex.\nThis is the most distinctively human feature of your brain; relative to the rest of the brain, it\u2019s larger in humans than in most other\nspecies. This is where you experience the conscious awareness of decision making (the so-called \u201cexecutive function\u201d), as well as\n\nthe application of logic and reasoning.\n\nb. Your two \u201cyous\u201d fight to control you. It\u2019s like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, though your higher-level you is not aware of your lower-level\nyou. This conflict is universal; if you pay close enough attention, you can actually see when the different parts of a person\u2019s brain\nare arguing with one another. For example, when someone gets \u201cangry with himself,\u201d his prefrontal cortex is sparring with his\namygdala (or other lower-level parts of his brain). When someone asks, \u201cWhy did I let myself eat all that cake?\u201d the answer is \u201cBe-\ncause the lower-level you won out over the thoughtful, higher-level you.\u201d\n\nOnce you understand how your a) logical/conscious you and b) emotional/subconscious you fight with each other, you can\nimagine what it\u2019s like when your two yous deal with other people and their own two \u201cthems.\u201d It\u2019s a mess. Those lower-level selves\nare like attack dogs\u2014they want to fight even when their higher-level selves want to figure things out. This is very confusing be-\ncause you and the people you are dealing with typically don\u2019t even know that these lower-level beasts exist, never mind that they\nare trying to hijack everyone's behavior.\n\nLet\u2019s look at what tends to happen when someone disagrees with you and asks you to explain your thinking. Because you are\n\nprogrammed to view such challenges as attacks, you get angry, even though it would be more logical for you to be interested in the\n\f"}, "001396.png": {"text": "other person\u2019s perspective, especially if they are intelligent. When you try to explain your behavior, your explanations don\u2019t make\nany sense. That\u2019s because your lower-level you is trying to speak through your upper-level you. Your deep-seated, hidden motiva-\ntions are in control, so it is impossible for you to logically explain what \u201cyou\u201d are doing.\n\nEven the most intelligent people generally behave this way, and it\u2019s tragic. To be effective you must not let your need to be right\nbe more important than your need to find out what\u2019s true. If you are too proud of what you know or of how good you are at some-\n\nthing you will learn less, make inferior decisions, and fall short of your potential.\n\nc. Understand your blind spot barrier. In addition to your ego barrier, you (and everyone else) also have blind spots\u2014areas where your way\nof thinking prevents you from seeing things accurately. Just as we all have different ranges for hearing pitch and seeing colors, we\nhave different ranges for seeing and understanding things. We each see things in our own way. For example, some people naturally\nsee big pictures and miss small details while others naturally see details and miss big pictures; some people are linear thinkers\nwhile others think laterally, and so on.\n\nNaturally, people can\u2019t appreciate what they can\u2019t see. A person who can\u2019t identify patterns and synthesize doesn\u2019t know what\nit\u2019s like to see patterns and synthesize any more than a color-blind person knows what it\u2019s like to see color. These differences in how\nour brains work are much less apparent than the differences in how our bodies work. Color-blind people eventually find out that\nthey are color-blind, whereas most people never see or understand the ways in which their ways of thinking make them blind. To\nmake it even harder, we don\u2019t like to see ourselves or others as having blind spots, even though we all have them. When you point\nout someone\u2019s psychological weakness, it\u2019s generally about as well received as if you pointed out a physical weakness.\n\nIf you're like most people, you have no clue how other people see things and aren\u2019t good at seeking to understand what they\nare thinking, because you're too preoccupied with telling them what you yourself think is correct. In other words, you are closed-\nminded; you presume too much. This closed-mindedness is terribly costly; it causes you to miss out on all sorts of wonderful pos-\nsibilities and dangerous threats that other people might be showing you\u2014and it blocks criticism that could be constructive and\n\neven lifesaving.\n\f"}, "001397.png": {"text": "The end result of these two barriers is that parties in disagreements typically remain convinced that they\u2019re right\u2014and often\nend up angry at each other. This is illogical and leads to suboptimal decision making. After all, when two people reach opposite\nconclusions, someone must be wrong. Shouldn\u2019t you want to make sure that someone isn\u2019t you?\n\nThis failure to benefit from others\u2019 thinking doesn\u2019t just occur when disagreements arise; it occurs when people encounter prob-\nlems that they are trying to solve. When trying to figure things out, most people spin in their own heads instead of taking in all\nthe wonderful thinking available to them. As a result, they continually run toward what they see and keep crashing into what they\nare blind to until the crashing leads them to adapt. Those who adapt do so by a) teaching their brains to work in a way that doesn\u2019t\ncome naturally (the creative person learns to become organized through discipline and practice, for instance), b) using compensat-\ning mechanisms (such as programmed reminders), and/or c) relying on the help of others who are strong where they are weak.\n\nDifferences in thinking can be symbiotic and complementary instead of disruptive. For example, the lateral approach to think-\ning common among creative people can lead them to be unreliable, while more linear thinkers are often more dependable; some\npeople are more emotional while others are more logical, and so on. None of these individuals would be able to succeed at any kind\nof complex project without the help of others who have complementary strengths.\n\nAristotle defined tragedy as a terrible outcome arising from a person\u2019s fatal flaw\u2014a flaw that, had it been fixed, instead would\nhave led to a wonderful outcome.

You can do it; everybody can. Here\u2019s how.\n\n3.2 Practice radical open-mindedness.\n\nIf you know that you are blind, you can figure out a way to see, whereas if you don\u2019t know that you're blind, you will continue to\n\nbump into your problems. In other words, if you can recognize that you have blind spots and open-mindedly consider the possi-\n\f"}, "001398.png": {"text": "bility that others might see something better than you\u2014and that the threats and opportunities they are trying to point out really\nexist\u2014you are more likely to make good decisions.\n\nRadical open-mindedness is motivated by the genuine worry that you might not be seeing your choices optimally. It is the\nability to effectively explore different points of view and different possibilities without letting your ego or your blind spots get\nin your way. It requires you to replace your attachment to always being right with the joy of learning what\u2019s true. Radical open-\nmindedness allows you to escape from the control of your lower-level you and ensures your upper-level you sees and considers all\nthe good choices and makes the best possible decisions. If you can acquire this ability\u2014and with practice you can\u2014you'll be able to\ndeal with your realities more effectively and radically improve your life.\n\nMost people don\u2019t understand what it means to be radically open-minded. They describe open-mindedness as being \u201copen to\nbeing wrong,\u201d but stubbornly cling to whatever opinion is in their head and fail to seek an understanding of the reasoning behind\n\nalternative points of view. To be radically open-minded you must:\n\na. Sincerely believe that you might not know the best possible path and recognize that your ability to deal well with \u201cnot knowing\u201d is more important than whatever it is you\ndo know. Most people make bad decisions because they are so certain that they\u2019re right that they don\u2019t allow themselves to see the\nbetter alternatives that exist. Radically open-minded people know that coming up with the right questions and asking other smart\npeople what they think is as important as having all the answers. They understand that you can\u2019t make a great decision without\nswimming for a while in a state of \u201cnot knowing.\u201d That is because what exists within the area of \u201cnot knowing\u201d is so much greater\n\nand more exciting than anything any one of us knows.\n\nb. Recognize that decision making is a two-step process: First take in all the relevant information, then decide. Most people are reluctant to take in informa-\ntion that is inconsistent with what they have already concluded. When I ask why, acommon answer is: \u201cI want to make up my own\n\nmind.\u201d These people seem to think that considering opposing views will somehow threaten their ability to decide what they want\n\f"}, "001399.png": {"text": "to do. Nothing could be further from the truth. Taking in others\u2019 perspectives in order to consider them in no way reduces your\n\nfreedom to think independently and make your own decisions. It will just broaden your perspective as you make them.\n\nc. Don't worry about looking good; worry about achieving your goal.\nPeople typically try to prove that they have the answer even when they don\u2019t. Why do they behave in this unproductive way? It\u2019s\ngenerally because they believe the senseless but common view that great people have all the answers and don\u2019t have any weak-\nnesses. Not only does this view not square with reality, it stands in the way of their progress. People interested in making the best\npossible decisions are rarely confident that they have the best answers. They recognize that they have weaknesses and blind spots,\n\nand they always seek to learn more so that they can get around them.\n\nd. Realize that you can't put out without taking in. Most people seem much more eager to put out (convey their thinking and be productive)\nthan to take in (learn). That\u2019s a mistake even if one\u2019s primary goal is to put out, because what one puts out won't be good unless one\n\ntakes in as well.\n\ne. Recognize that to gain the perspective that comes from seeing things through another's eyes, you must suspend judgment for a time\u2014only by empathizing can you properly\nevaluate another point of view. Open-mindedness doesn\u2019t mean going along with what you don\u2019t believe in; it means considering the rea-\nsoning of others instead of stubbornly and illogically holding on to your own point of view. To be radically open-minded, you need\n\nto be so open to the possibility that you could be wrong that you encourage others to tell you so.\n\nf. Remember that you're looking for the best answer, not simply the best answer that you can come up with yourself. The answer doesn\u2019t have to be in your\nhead; you can look outside yourself. If you're truly looking at things objectively, you must recognize that the probability of you\nalways having the best answer is small and that, even if you have it, you can\u2019t be confident that you do before others test you. So it\nis invaluable to know what you don\u2019t know. Ask yourself: Am I seeing this just through my own eyes? If so, then you should know\n\nthat you're terribly handicapped.\n\f"}, "001400.png": {"text": "g. Be clear on whether you are arguing or seeking to understand, and think about which is most appropriate based on your and others\u2019 believability. If both parties are\npeers, it\u2019s appropriate to argue. But if one person is clearly more knowledgeable than the other, it is preferable for the less knowl-\nedgeable person to approach the more knowledgeable one as a student and for the more knowledgeable one to act as a teacher.\nDoing this well requires you to understand the concept of believability. I define believable people as those who have repeatedly and\nsuccessfully accomplished the thing in question\u2014who have a strong track record with at least three successes\u2014and have great ex-\nplanations of their approach when probed.\n\nIf you have a different view than someone who is believable on the topic at hand\u2014or at least more believable than you are (if,\nsay, you are in a discussion with your doctor about your health)\u2014you should make it clear that you are asking questions because\nyou are seeking to understand their perspective. Conversely, if you are clearly the more believable person, you might politely re-\n\nmind the other of that and suggest that they ask you questions.\n\nAll these strategies come together in two practices that, if you seek to become radically open-minded, you must master.\n\n3.3 Appreciate the art of thoughtful disagreement.\n\nWhen two people believe opposite things, chances are that one of them is wrong. It pays to find out if that someone is you. That\u2019s\nwhy I believe you must appreciate and develop the art of thoughtful disagreement. In thoughtful disagreement, your goal is not\nto convince the other party that you are right\u2014it is to find out which view is true and decide what to do about it. In thoughtful\ndisagreement, both parties are motivated by the genuine fear of missing important perspectives. Exchanges in which you really\nsee what the other person is seeing and they really see what you are seeing\u2014with both your \u201chigher-level yous\u201d trying to get to the\n\ntruth\u2014are immensely helpful and a giant source of untapped potential.\n\f"}, "001401.png": {"text": "To do this well, approach the conversation in a way that conveys that you're just trying to understand. Use questions rather\nthan make statements. Conduct the discussion in a calm and dispassionate manner, and encourage the other person to do that as\nwell. Remember, you are not arguing; you are openly exploring what\u2019s true. Be reasonable and expect others to be reasonable. If\nyou're calm, collegial, and respectful you will do a lot better than if you are not. You'll get better at this with practice.\n\nTo me, it\u2019s pointless when people get angry with each other when they disagree because most disagreements aren't threats as\nmuch as opportunities for learning. People who change their minds because they learned something are the winners, whereas\nthose who stubbornly refuse to learn are the losers. That doesn\u2019t mean that you should blindly accept others\u2019 conclusions. You\nshould be what I call open-minded and assertive at the same time\u2014you should hold and explore conflicting possibilities in your\nmind while moving fluidly toward whatever is likely to be true based on what you learn. Some people can do this easily while oth-\ners can\u2019t. A good exercise to make sure that you are doing this well is to describe back to the person you are disagreeing with their\nown perspective. If they agree that you've got it, then you're in good shape. I also recommend that both parties observe a \u201ctwo-\nminute rule\u201d in which neither interrupts the other, so they both have time to get all their thoughts out.\n\nSome people worry that operating this way is time consuming. Working through disagreements does take time but it\u2019s just\nabout the best way you can spend it. What\u2019s important is that you prioritize what you spend time on and who you spend it with.\nThere are lots of people who will disagree with you, and it would be unproductive to consider all their views. It doesn\u2019t pay to be\nopen-minded with everyone. Instead, spend your time exploring ideas with the most believable people you have access to.\n\nIf you find you're at an impasse, agree on a person you both respect and enlist them to help moderate the discussion. What\u2019s\nreally counterproductive is spinning in your own head about what\u2019s going on, which most people are prone to do\u2014or wasting time\ndisagreeing past the point of diminishing returns. When that happens, move on to a more productive way of getting to a mutual\nunderstanding, which isn\u2019t necessarily the same thing as agreement. For example, you might agree to disagree.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t thoughtful disagreement like this typically occur? Because most people are instinctively reluctant to disagree. For\nexample, if two people go to a restaurant and one says he likes the food, the other is more likely to say \u201cI like it too\u201d or not say any-\n\nthing at all, even if that\u2019s not true.

That\u2019s why radical open-mindedness isn\u2019t easy: You need to teach yourself the art of having exchanges in ways that don\u2019t\ntrigger such reactions in yourself or others. This was what I had to learn back when Bob, Giselle, and Dan told me I made people feel\nbelittled.\n\nHolding wrong opinions in one\u2019s head and making bad decisions based on them instead of having thoughtful disagreements is\none of the greatest tragedies of mankind. Being able to thoughtfully disagree would so easily lead to radically improved decision\n\nmaking in all areas\u2014public policy, politics, medicine, science, philanthropy, personal relationships, and more.\n\n3.4 Triangulate your view with believable people who are willing to disagree.\n\nBy questioning experts individually and encouraging them to have thoughtful disagreement with each other that I can listen to\nand ask questions about, I both raise my probability of being right and become much better educated. This is most true when the\nexperts disagree with me or with each other. Smart people who can thoughtfully disagree are the greatest teachers, far better than\na professor assigned to stand in front of a board and lecture at you. The knowledge I acquire usually leads to principles that I de-\nvelop and refine for similar cases that arise in the future.\n\nIn some cases in which the subjects are just too complex for me to understand in the time required, I will turn over the decision\nmaking to knowledgeable others who are more believable than me, but I still want to listen in on their thoughtful disagreement. I\nfind that most people don\u2019t do that\u2014they prefer to make their own decisions, even when they\u2019re not qualified to make the kinds of\njudgments required. In doing so, they\u2019re giving in to their lower-level selves.\n\nThis approach of triangulating the views of believable people can have a profound effect on your life. I know it has made the\ndifference between life and death for me. In June 2013, I went to Johns Hopkins for an annual physical, where I was told that I had\na precancerous condition called Barrett\u2019s esophagus with high-grade dysplasia. Dysplasia is an early stage in the development of\n\ncancer, and the probability that it will turn into esophageal cancer is relatively high\u2014about 15 percent of cases per year. Cancer of\n\f"}, "001403.png": {"text": "the esophagus is deadly, so if left untreated, the odds were that in something like three to five years I'd develop cancer and die. The\nstandard protocol for cases like mine is to remove the esophagus, but I wasn\u2019t a candidate for that because of something specific to\nmy condition. The doctor advised that I wait and see how things progressed.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, I started to plan for my eventual death, while also fighting to live. I like to:\n\na. Plan for the worst-case scenario to make it as good as possible. I felt fortunate because this prognosis gave me enough time to ensure that the\npeople I cared most about would be okay without me, and to savor life with them in the years I had left. I would have time to get to\nknow my first grandson, who had just been born, but not so much time that I could take it for granted.\n\nBut as you know by now, rather than following what I am told is best, even by an expert, I like to triangulate opinions with be-\nlievable people. So I also had my personal physician, Dr. Glazer, set up visits with four other experts on this particular disease.\n\nThe first call was with the head of thoracic surgery at a major cancer hospital. She explained that my condition had advanced\nquickly and that, contrary to what the first physician said, there was a surgery that could cure me. It would involve removing both\nmy esophagus and my stomach and attaching my intestines to the remaining little bit of my esophagus I'd have left. She estimated\nI'd have a 10 percent chance of dying on the operating table and a 70 percent chance of a crippling outcome. But the odds were in\nfavor of my living, so her recommendation was clearly worth taking seriously. Naturally I wanted her to speak with the doctor\nfrom Johns Hopkins who originally diagnosed me and recommended a watch-and-wait approach, so right then and there I called\nthe other doctor to see what each would say about the other\u2019s views. This was eye-opening. While the two doctors had told me\ncompletely different things when I met with them in person, when they were on the phone together, they sought to minimize their\ndisagreement and make the other look good, putting professional courtesy ahead of thrashing things out to get at the best answer.\nStill, the differences in their views were clear, and listening to them deepened my understanding.\n\nThe next day I met with a third doctor who was a world-renowned specialist and researcher at another esteemed hospital. He\ntold me that my condition would basically cause me no problems so long as I came in for an endoscopic examination every three\n\nmonths. He explained that it was like skin cancer but on the inside\u2014if it was watched and any new growth was clipped before it\n\f"}, "001404.png": {"text": "metastasized into the bloodstream, I\u2019d be okay.

Life went on as normal for them\nexcept for those occasional examinations and procedures.\n\nTo recap: Over the course of forty-eight hours, I had gone from a likely death sentence to a likely cure that would essentially\ninvolve disemboweling me, and then finally to a simple, and only slightly inconvenient, way of watching for abnormalities and re-\nmoving them before they could cause any harm. Was this doctor wrong?\n\nDr. Glazer and I went on to meet two other world-class specialists and they both agreed that undergoing the scoping procedure\nwould do no harm, so I decided to go ahead with it. During the procedure, they clipped some tissue from my esophagus and sent it\nto the laboratory for testing. A few days after the procedure, exactly a week before my sixty-fourth birthday, I got the results. They\nwere shocking to say the least. After analyzing the tissue, it turned out there wasn\u2019t any high-grade dysplasia at all!\n\nEven experts can make mistakes; my point is simply that it pays to be radically open-minded and triangulate with smart people.\nHad I not pushed for other opinions, my life would have taken a very different course. My point is that you can significantly raise\n\nyour probabilities of making the right decisions by open-mindedly triangulating with believable people.\n\n3.5 Recognize the signs of closed-mindedness and open-mindedness that you should watch out for.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to tell an open-minded person from a closed-minded person because they act very differently. Here are some cues to tell\n\nyou whether you or others are being closed-minded:\n\n1. Closed-minded people don\u2019t want their ideas challenged. They are typically frustrated that they can\u2019t get the other person to agree with\nthem instead of curious as to why the other person disagrees. They feel bad about getting something wrong and are more\n\ninterested in being proven right than in asking questions and learning others\u2019 perspectives.\n\f"}, "001405.png": {"text": "Open-minded people are more curious about why there is disagreement. They are not angry when someone disagrees.They understand\nthat there is always the possibility that they might be wrong and that it\u2019s worth the little bit of time it takes to consider\n\nthe other person\u2019s views in order to be sure they aren\u2019t missing something or making a mistake.\n\n2. Closed-minded people are more likely to make statements than ask questions. While believability entitles you to make statements in certain\n\ncircumstances, truly open-minded people, even the most believable people I know, always ask a lot of questions. Nonbe-\n\n \n\nlievable people often tell me that their statements are actually implicit questions, though they\u2019re phrased as low-confi-\ndence statements. While that\u2019s sometimes true, in my experience it\u2019s more often not.\nOpen-minded people genuinely believe they could be wrong; the questions that they ask are genuine. They also assess their relative believability\n\nto determine whether their primary role should be as a student, a teacher, or a peer.\n\n3. Closed-minded people focus much more on being understood than on understanding others. When people disagree, they tend to be quicker to as-\nsume that they aren\u2019t being understood than to consider whether they\u2019re the ones who are not understanding the other\nperson\u2019s perspective.\n\nOpen-minded people always feel compelled to see things through others\u2019 eyes.\n\n4, Closed-minded people say things like \u201cI could be wrong . . . but here's my opinion.\u201d This is a classic cue I hear all the time. It\u2019s often a perfunctory\ngesture that allows people to hold their own opinion while convincing themselves that they are being open-minded. If\nyour statement starts with \u201cI could be wrong\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not believable,\u201d you should probably follow it with a question and\nnot an assertion.\n\nOpen-minded people know when to make statements and when to ask questions.\n\n5. Closed-minded people block others from speaking. If it seems like someone isn\u2019t leaving space for the other person in a conversation, it\u2019s\n\npossible they are blocking. To get around blocking, enforce the \u201ctwo-minute rule\u201d I mentioned earlier.\n\f"}, "001406.png": {"text": "Open-minded people are always more interested in listening than in speaking; they encourage others to voice their views.\n\n6. Closed-minded people have trouble holding two thoughts simultaneously in their minds. They allow their own view to crowd out those of others.\nOpen-minded people can take in the thoughts of others without losing their ability to think well\u2014they can hold two or more conflicting concepts in their mind and\n\ngo back and forth between them to assess their relative merits.\n\n7. Closed-minded people lack a deep sense of humility. Humility typically comes from an experience of crashing, which leads to an enlight-\nened focus on knowing what one doesn\u2019t know.\n\nOpen-minded people approach everything with a deep-seated fear that they may be wrong.\n\nOnce you can sort out open-minded from closed-minded people, you'll find that you want to surround yourself with open-minded\nones. Doing so will not only make your decision making more effective but you'll also learn a tremendous amount. A few good de-\ncision makers working effectively together can significantly outperform a good decision maker working alone\u2014and even the best\n\ndecision maker can significantly improve his or her decision making with the help of other excellent decision makers.\n\n3.6 Understand how you can become radically open-minded.\n\nNo matter how open-minded you are now, it is something you can learn. To practice open-mindedness:\n\na. Regularly use pain as your guide toward quality reflection. Mental pain often comes from being too attached to an idea when a person or an\nevent comes along to challenge it. This is especially true when what is being pointed out to you involves a weakness on your part.\nThis kind of mental pain is a clue that you are potentially wrong and that you need to think about the question in a quality way. To\n\ndo this, first calm yourself down. This can be difficult: You will probably feel your amygdala kicking in through a tightening in your\n\f"}, "001407.png": {"text": "head, tension in your body, or an emerging sense of annoyance, anger, or irritability. Note these feelings when they arise in you. By\nbeing aware of such signals of closed-mindedness, you can use them as cues to control your behavior and guide yourself toward\nopen-mindedness. Doing this regularly will strengthen your ability to keep your \u201chigher-level you\u201d in control. The more you do it,\n\nthe stronger you will become.\n\nb. Make being open-minded a habit. The life that you will live is most simply the result of habits you develop. If you consistently use\nfeelings of anger/frustration as cues to calm down, slow down, and approach the subject at hand thoughtfully, over time you'll ex-\nperience negative emotions much less frequently and go directly to the open-minded practices I just described.\n\nOf course, this can be very hard for people to do in the moment because your \u201clower-level you\u201d emotions are so powerful. The\ngood news is that these \u201camygdala hijackings\u201d\u2122 don\u2019t last long so even if you're having trouble controlling yourself in the moment,\nyou can also allow a little time to pass to give your higher-level you space to reflect in a quality way. Have others whom you respect\n\nhelp you too.\n\nc. Get to know your blind spots. When you are closed-minded and form an opinion in an area where you have a blind spot, it can be deadly.\nSo take some time to record the circumstances in which you've consistently made bad decisions because you failed to see what\n\nothers saw. Ask others\u2014especially those who've seen what you\u2019ve missed\u2014to help you with this. Write a list, tack it up on the wall,\nand stare at it.

At first I thought that hiring\nsmart people\u2014for instance, the top students out of the top schools\u2014should get me capable employees, but as often as not, those\npeople didn\u2019t turn out well. \u201cBook smarts\u201d didn\u2019t typically equate to the type of smarts I needed.\n\nI wanted to work with independent thinkers who were creative, conceptual, and had a lot of common sense. But I had a hard\ntime finding those sorts of people and even when I did, I was shocked at how differently their brains seemed to work. It was as\nthough we were speaking different languages. For example, those who were \u201cconceptual\u201d and imprecise spoke one language while\nthose who were literal and precise spoke another. At the time, we chalked this up to \u201ccommunication problems,\u201d but the differ-\nences were much deeper than that\u2014and they were painful for all of us, particularly when we were trying to achieve big things\ntogether.\n\nIremember one research project\u2014an ambitious attempt to systemize our global understanding of the bond markets\u2014that took\nplace years ago. Bob Prince was running it, and while we agreed conceptually on what we were trying to do, the project didn\u2019t get\npushed through to results. We'd meet with Bob and his team to agree on the goal and lay out how to get there. But when they\u2019d go\noff to work on it, they\u2019d make no progress. The problem was that conceptual people who visualized what should be done in vague\nways expected more literal people to figure out for themselves how to do it. When they didn\u2019t, the more conceptual people thought\nthe more literal people had no imagination, and the more literal people thought the more conceptual people had their heads in the\nclouds. To make matters worse, none of them knew which were which\u2014the more literal people thought that they were as concep-\ntual as the conceptual people and vice versa. In short, we were gridlocked, and everyone thought it was someone else\u2019s fault\u2014that\nthe people they were locking horns with were blind, stubborn, or just plain stupid.\n\nThose meetings were painful for everyone. Because no one was clear about what they were good or bad at, everybody expressed\nopinions about everything and there wasn\u2019t any sensible way of sorting through them. We discussed why the group was failing,\nwhich led us to see that the individuals Bob had chosen for his team reflected his own strengths and weaknesses in their own roles.\nWhile that took frankness and open-mindedness and was a big step forward, it wasn\u2019t recorded and systematically converted into\n\nadequate changes, so the same people kept making the same sort of mistakes, over and over again.\n\f"}, "001415.png": {"text": "Isn\u2019t it obvious that our different ways of thinking, our emotional responses, and our not having ways of dealing with them is\ncrippling us?

Good people with good intentions get angry and emotional; it is frustrating and often becomes personal. Most com-\npanies avoid this by suppressing open debate and having those with the most authority simply make the calls. I didn\u2019t want that\nkind of company. I knew we needed to dig more deeply into what was preventing us from working together more effectively, bring\nthose things to the surface, and explore them.\n\nBridgewater's roughly 1,500 employees do many different things\u2014some strive to understand the global markets; others develop\ntechnologies; still others serve clients, manage health insurance and other benefits for employees, provide legal guidance, manage\nIT and facilities, and so on. All these activities require different types of people to work together in ways that harvest the best ideas\nand throw away the worst. Organizing people to complement their strengths and compensate for their weaknesses is like conduct-\ning an orchestra. It can be magnificent if done well and terrible if done poorly.\n\nWhile \u201cknow thyself\u201d and \u201cto thine own self be true\u201d are fundamental tenets I had heard long before I began looking into the\nbrain, I had no idea how to go about getting that knowledge or how to act on it until we made these discoveries about how people\nthink differently. The better we know ourselves, the better we can recognize both what can be changed and how to change it, and\nwhat can\u2019t be changed and what we can do about that. So no matter what you set out to do\u2014whether on your own, as a member of\n\nan organization, or as its director\u2014you need to understand how you and other people are wired.\n\n4.1 Understand the power that comes from knowing how you and others are wired.\n\nAs I related in the first part of this book, my first breakthrough in understanding how people think differently occurred when I\n\n\u2018was a young father and had my kids tested by Dr. Sue Quinlan. I found the results remarkable, because she not only confirmed my\n\f"}, "001416.png": {"text": "own observations of the ways that their minds were working at the time but also predicted how they would develop in the future.\nFor example, one of my kids was struggling with arithmetic. Because he tested well in mathematical reasoning, she correctly told\nhim that if he pushed through the boredom of rote memorization required in elementary school, he would love the higher-level\nconcepts he would be exposed to when he got older. These insights opened my eyes to new possibilities. I turned to her and others\nyears later when I was trying to figure out the different thinking styles of my employees and colleagues.\n\nAt first, the experts gave me both bad and good advice. Many seemed as if they were more interested in making people feel good\n(or not feel bad) than they were at getting at the truth. Even more startling, I found that most psychologists didn\u2019t know much\nabout neuroscience and most neuroscientists didn\u2019t know much about psychology\u2014and both were reluctant to connect the phys-\niological differences in people\u2019s brains to the differences in their aptitudes and behaviors. But eventually I found Dr. Bob Eichinger,\nwho opened the world of psychometric testing to me. Using Myers-Briggs and other assessments, we evolved a much clearer and\nmore data-driven way of understanding our different types of thinking.\n\nOur differences weren't a product of poor communication; it was the other way around. Our different ways of thinking led to\nour poor communications.\n\nFrom conversations with experts and my own observations, I learned that many of our mental differences are physiological.\nJust as our physical attributes determine the limits of what we are able to do physically\u2014some people are tall and others are short,\nsome muscular and others weak\u2014our brains are innately different in ways that set the parameters of what we are able to do men-\ntally. As with our bodies, some parts of our brains cannot be materially affected by external experience (in the same way that your\nskeleton isn\u2019t changed much through working out), while other parts can be strengthened through exercise (I will have more to\nsay about brain plasticity later in this chapter).\n\nThis was driven home to me by my son Paul's three-year struggle with bipolar disorder. As terrifying and frustrating as his\nbehavior was, I came to realize that it was due to his brain\u2019s chemistry (specifically, its secreting serotonin and dopamine in spurts\nand sputters). As I went through that terrible journey with him, I experienced the frustration and anger of trying to reason with\n\nsomeone who wasn\u2019t thinking well. I constantly had to remind myself that there was no basis for my anger because his distorted\n\f"}, "001417.png": {"text": "logic was a product of his physiology\u2014and I saw for myself how the doctors who approached it that way brought him to a state\n\nof crystal clarity. The experience not only taught me a lot about how brains work but why creative genius often exists at the edge\nof insanity. Many highly productive and creative people have suffered from bipolar disorder, among them Ernest Hemingway,\nBeethoven, Tchaikovsky, Vincent van Gogh, Jackson Pollock, Virginia Woolf, Winston Churchill, and the psychologist Kay Redfield\nJamison (who has written frankly about her own experiences with the disease in her book An Unquiet Mind). I learned that we are\nall different because of the different ways that the machine that is our brain works\u2014and that nearly one in five Americans are clin-\nically mentally ill in one way or another.\n\nOnce I understood that it\u2019s all physiological, many things became clearer to me. While I used to get angry and frustrated at\npeople because of the choices they made, I came to realize that they weren't intentionally acting in a way that seemed counterpro-\nductive; they were just living out things as they saw them, based on how their brains worked. I also realized that as off-base as they\nseemed to me, they saw me the same way. The only sensible way of behaving with each other was to look down upon ourselves\nwith mutual understanding so we could make objective sense of things. Not only did this make our disagreements less frustrating,\nit also allowed us to maximize our effectiveness.\n\nEveryone is like a Lego set of attributes, with each piece reflecting the workings of a different part of their brain. All these pieces\ncome together to determine what each person is like, and if you know what a person is like, you'll have a pretty good idea of what\n\nyou can expect from them.\n\na. We are born with attributes that can both help us and hurt us, depending on their application. Most attributes are a double-edged sword that bring\npotential benefits and potential harm. The more extreme the attribute, the more extreme the potential good or bad outcomes it is\nlikely to produce. For example, a highly creative, goal-oriented person good at imagining new ideas might undervalue the minu-\ntiae of daily life, which is also important; he might be so driven in his pursuit of long-term goals that he might have disdain for\npeople who focus on the details of daily life. Similarly, a task-oriented person who is great with details might undervalue creativity\n\n\u2014and worse still, may squelch it in the interests of efficiency. These two people might make a great team, but are likely to have\n\f"}, "001418.png": {"text": "trouble taking advantage of the ways they\u2019re complementary, because the ways their minds work make it difficult for them to see\nthe value of each other\u2019s ways of thinking.\n\nHaving expectations for people (including yourself) without knowing what they are like is a sure way to get in trouble. I learned\nthis the hard way, through years of frustrating conversations and the pain of expecting things from people who were constitution-\nally incapable of delivering them. I\u2019m sure that I caused them plenty of pain too. Over time, I realized that I needed a systematic\napproach to capturing and recording our differences so that we could actively take them into consideration when putting people\ninto different roles at Bridgewater.\n\nThis led to one of my most valuable management tools: Baseball Cards, which I mentioned in the first part of this book. Just as a\nbaseball card compiles the relevant data on a baseball player, helping fans know what that player is good and bad at, I decided that\nit would be similarly helpful for us to have cards for all of our players at Bridgewater.\n\nIn creating the attributes for our baseball cards, I used a combination of adjectives we already used to describe people, like \u201ccon-\nceptual,\u201d \u201creliable,\u201d \u201ccreative,\u201d and \u201cdetermined\u201d; the actions people took or didn\u2019t take such as \u201cholding others accountable\u201d and\n\u201cpushing through to results\u201d; and terms from personality tests such as \u201cextroverted\u201d or \u201cjudging.\u201d Once the cards were established,\nI created a process to have people evaluate each other, with the people rated highest in each dimension (e.g., \u201cmost creative\u201d)\nhaving more weight on the ratings of other people in that dimension. People with proven track records in a certain area would\nget more believability, or decision-making weight, within that area. By recording these qualities in people\u2019s Baseball Cards, others\nwho'd never worked with them before could know what to expect from them. When people changed, their rating would change.\nAnd when they didn\u2019t change, we were even more sure of what we could expect of them.\n\nNaturally when I introduced this tool, people were skeptical or scared of it for various reasons. Some were afraid that the cards\nwould be inaccurate; others thought it would be uncomfortable to have their weaknesses made so apparent, or that it would lead\nto their being pigeonholed, inhibiting their growth; still others thought it would be too complex to be practical. Imagine how you\nwould feel if you were asked to force-rank all your colleagues on creativity, determination, or reliability. Most people at first find\n\nthat prospect frightening.\n\f"}, "001419.png": {"text": "Still, I knew that we needed to be radically open in recording and considering what people were like, and that things would\neventually evolve to address people\u2019s concerns if we were sensible about how we approached the process. Today, most everyone\nat Bridgewater finds these Baseball Cards to be essential, and we have built a whole suite of other tools, which will be further de-\nscribed in Work Principles, to support our drive to understand what people are like and who is believable at what.\n\nT\u2019ve already noted that our unique way of operating and the treasure trove of data we accumulated brought us to the attention of\nsome world-renowned organizational psychologists and researchers. Bob Kegan of Harvard University, Adam Grant of the Whar-\nton School, and Ed Hess of the University of Virginia have written about us extensively, and I have learned a great deal from them\nin turn. In a way I never intended, our trial-and-error discovery process has put us at the cutting edge of academic thinking about\npersonal development within organizations. As Kegan wrote in his book An Everyone Culture, \u201cfrom the individual experience of\nprobing in every one-on-one meeting, to the technologically integrated processes for discussing . . . issues and baseball cards, to\nthe company-wide practices of daily updates and cases, Bridgewater has built an ecosystem to support personal development. The\nsystem helps everyone in the company confront the truth about what everyone is like.\u201d\n\nOur journey of discovery has coincided with an incredibly fertile epoch in neuroscience, when, thanks to rapid advances in\nbrain imaging and the ability to gather and process big data, our understanding has accelerated dramatically. As with all sciences\non the cusp of breakthroughs, I am sure that much of what is thought to be true today will soon be radically improved. But what I\ndo know is how incredibly beautiful and useful it is to understand how the thinking machine between our ears works.\n\nHere\u2019s some of what I\u2019ve learned:\n\nThe brain is even more complex than we can imagine. It has an estimated eighty-nine billion tiny computers (called neurons)\nthat are connected to each other through many trillions of \u201cwires\u201d called axons and chemical synapses. As David Eagleman de-\n\nscribes it in his wonderful book Incognito:\n\nYour brain is built of cells called neurons and glia\u2014hundreds of billions of them. Each one of them is as complex as acity.... The\n\ncells [neurons] are connected in a network of such staggering complexity that it bankrupts human language and necessitates new\n\f"}, "001420.png": {"text": "strains of mathematics. A typical neuron makes about ten thousand connections to neighboring neurons. Given billions of neu-\nrons, this means that there are as many connections in a single cubic centimeter of brain tissue as there are stars in the Milky Way\n\ngalaxy.\n\nWhen we are born our brains are preprogrammed with learning accumulated over hundreds of millions of years. For example,\nresearchers at the University of Virginia have shown that while many people have an instinctual fear of snakes, no one has an\ninstinctual fear of flowers. The brains that we were born with had learned that snakes are dangerous and flowers are not. There\u2019s a\nreason for that.\n\nThere is one grand design for the brains of all mammals, fish, birds, amphibians, and reptiles, which was established nearly 300\nmillion years ago and has been evolving ever since. Just as cars have evolved into different versions\u2014sedans, SUVs, sports cars, etc.\n\u2014that rely on many of the same underlying parts, all vertebrate brains have similar parts that do similar things but that are well\nadapted to the needs of their own particular species. For example, birds have superior occipital lobes because they need to spot\nprey (and predators) from great heights. While we humans think of ourselves as superior overall because we overemphasize the\nimportance of our own advantages, other species could justifiably make the same claims on their own behalf\u2014birds for flight, eye-\nsight, and instinctual magnetic navigation; most animals for smell; and several for appearing to have particularly enjoyable sex.\n\nThis \u201cuniversal brain\u201d has evolved from the bottom up, meaning that its lower parts are evolutionarily the oldest and the top\nparts are the newest. The brainstem controls the subconscious processes that keep us and other species alive\u2014heartbeat, breath-\ning, nervous system, and our degree of arousal and alertness. The next layer up, the cerebellum, gives us the ability to control our\nlimb movements by coordinating sensory input with our muscles. Then comes the cerebrum, which includes the basal ganglia\n(which controls habit) and other parts of the limbic system (which controls emotional responses and some movement) and the\ncerebral cortex (which is where our memories, thoughts, and sense of consciousness reside).

It is one of the\ndefining characteristics of being human.\n\nLeonard Mlodinow, in his excellent book Subliminal, writes, \u201cWe usually assume that what distinguishes us [from other species]\nis IQ But it is our social 1Q that ought to be the principal quality that differentiates us.\u201d He points out that humans have a unique\nability to understand what other people are like and how they are likely to behave.

This sort of human understand-\ning and cooperation is what makes us so accomplished as a species.

Wilson surmises that between one\nmillion and two million years ago, when our ancestors were somewhere between chimpanzees and modern homo sapiens, the\nbrain evolved in ways supporting cooperation so man could hunt and do other activities. This led the centers of memory and\nreasoning in the prefrontal cortex to develop beyond those of our primate relatives. As groups became more powerful than indi-\nviduals and our brains evolved in ways that made larger groups manageable, competition between groups became more important\nthan competition between individuals and groups that had more cooperative individuals did better than those without them.

For example, the brain evolution that I described has given us (some people more than others) the ability to see ourselves\nand our circumstances from a higher holistic level and, in some cases, to value the whole that we are part of even more than\nourselves.\n\nA few years ago, I had a conversation with the Dalai Lama in which I explained to him the contemporary neuroscience view that\nall of our thinking and feeling is due to physiology (in other words, the chemicals, electricity, and biology in our brains working\nlike a machine). This implied that spirituality is due to these physiological mechanics rather than something coming from above,\nso asked him what he thought about that. Without hesitation, he responded \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d and told me that the next day he was\nmeeting with the University of Wisconsin professor of neuroscience who had helped him learn about this, and he asked me if\nI wanted to join him. Regrettably, I couldn\u2019t but I recommended to him a book I'd read on the subject called The Spiritual Brain\n(which I also recommend to you). In our conversation, we went on to discuss the similarities and differences between spirituality\nand religion. His view was that prayer and meditation seemed to have similar effects on the brain in producing feelings of spiritu-\nality (the rising above oneself to feel a greater connection to the whole) but that each religion adds its own different superstitions\non top of that common feeling of spirituality. Rather than trying to squeeze my own summary of his thinking in here, I'll simply\n\nrecommend the Dalai Lama\u2019s book, Beyond Religion, if you're interested in learning more.\n\f"}, "001424.png": {"text": "In imagining what the future of our thinking will be like, it\u2019s also interesting to consider how man himself might change how\nthe brain works. We are certainly doing that with drugs and technology. Given advances in genetic engineering, it\u2019s reasonable to\nexpect that someday genetic engineers might mix and match features of different species\u2019 brains for different purposes\u2014if you\nwant to have a heightened sense of sight, say, genetic engineers might be able to manipulate the human brain so it grows optic\nlobes more like those of birds. But since such things won't happen anytime soon, let\u2019s get back to the practical question of how all\n\nthis can help us better deal with ourselves and each other.\n\n4.3 Understand the great brain battles and how to control them to get what \u201cyou\u201d want.\n\nThe following sections explore the different ways your brain fights for control of \u201cyou.\u201d While I will refer to the specific parts of the\nbrain that neurophysiologists believe are responsible for specific types of thinking and emotions, the actual physiology is much\n\nmore complex\u2014and scientists are only beginning to understand it.\n\na. Realize that the conscious mind is in a battle with the subconscious mind. Earlier in the book, I introduced the concept of the \u201ctwo yous\u201d and ex-\nplained how your higher-level you can look down on your lower-level you to make sure that your lower-level you isn\u2019t sabotaging\nwhat your higher-level you wants. Though I\u2019ve often seen these two yous in action in myself and others, it wasn\u2019t until I learned\nwhy they exist that I really understood them.\n\nAs with animals, many of our decision-making drivers are below the surface. An animal doesn\u2019t \u201cdecide\u201d to fly or hunt or sleep\nor fight in the way that we go about making many of our own choices of what to do\u2014it simply follows the instructions that come\nfrom the subconscious parts of its brain. These same sorts of instructions come to us from the same parts of our brains, sometimes\n\nfor good evolutionary reasons and sometimes to our detriment. Our subconscious fears and desires drive our motivations and\n\f"}, "001425.png": {"text": "actions through emotions such as love, fear, and inspiration. It\u2019s physiological. Love, for example, is a cocktail of chemicals (such as\noxytocin) secreted by the pituitary gland.\n\nWhile I had always assumed that logical conversation is the best way for people to get at what is true, armed with this new\nknowledge about the brain, I came to understand that there are large parts of our brains that don\u2019t do what is logical. For exam-\nple, I learned that when people refer to their \u201cfeelings\u2019\u2014such as saying \u201cI feel that you were unfair with me\u2019\u2014they are typically\nreferring to messages that originate in the emotional, subconscious parts of their brains. I also came to understand that while\nsome subconscious parts of our brains are dangerously animalistic, others are smarter and quicker than our conscious minds. Our\ngreatest moments of inspiration often \u201cpop\u201d up from our subconscious. We experience these creative breakthroughs when we are\nrelaxed and not trying to access the part of the brain in which they reside, which is generally the neocortex. When you say, \u201cI just\nthought of something,\u201d you noticed your subconscious mind telling your conscious mind something. With training, it\u2019s possible\nto open this stream of communication.\n\nMany people only see the conscious mind and aren\u2019t aware of the benefits of connecting it to the subconscious. They believe that\nthe way to accomplish more is to cram more into the conscious mind and make it work harder, but this is often counterproductive.\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive, clearing your head can be the best way to make progress.\n\nKnowing this, I now understand why creativity comes to me when I relax (like when I\u2019m in the shower) and how meditation\nhelps open this connection. Because it is physiological, I can actually feel the creative thoughts coming from elsewhere and flowing\ninto my conscious mind. It\u2019s a kick to understand how that works.\n\nBut a note of caution is in order too: When thoughts and instructions come to me from my subconscious, rather than acting on\nthem immediately, I have gotten into the habit of examining them with my conscious, logical mind. I have found that in addition\nto helping me figure out which thoughts are valid and why I am reacting to them as I do, doing this opens further communication\nbetween my conscious and subconscious minds. It\u2019s helpful to write down the results of this process. In fact that\u2019s how my Princi-\n\nples came about.\n\f"}, "001426.png": {"text": "If you take nothing else away from this chapter, be aware of your subconscious\u2014of how it can both harm you and help you,\nand how by consciously reflecting on what comes out of it, perhaps with the help of others, you can become happier and more\n\neffective.\n\nb. Know that the most constant struggle is between feeling and thinking. There are no greater battles than those between our feelings (most impor-\ntantly controlled by our amygdala, which operates subconsciously) and our rational thinking (most importantly controlled by our\nprefrontal cortex, which operates consciously). If you understand how those battles occur you will understand why it is so impor-\ntant to reconcile what you get from your subconscious with what you get from your conscious mind.\n\nThat damned amygdala, which is a little almond-shaped structure that lies deeply embedded in the cerebrum, is one of the most\npowerful parts of your brain. It controls your behavior, even though you're not conscious of it. How does it work? When some-\nthing upsets us\u2014and that something could be a sound, a sight, or just a gut feeling\u2014the amygdala sends notice to our bodies to\nprepare to fight or flee: the heartbeat speeds up, the blood pressure rises, and breathing quickens. During an argument, you'll often\nnotice a physical response similar to how you react to fear (for instance, rapid heartbeats and tensing muscles). Recognizing that,\nyour conscious mind (which resides in the prefrontal cortex) can refuse to obey its instructions. Typically, these amygdala hijack-\nings come on fast and dissipate quickly, except in rare cases, such as when a person develops post-traumatic stress disorder from\na particularly horrible event or series of events. Knowing how these hijackings work, you know that if you allow yourself to react\nspontaneously, you will be prone to overreact. You can also comfort yourself with the knowledge that whatever psychological pain\n\nyou are experiencing will go away before very long.\n\nc. Reconcile your feelings and your thinking. For most people, life is a never-ending battle between these two parts of the brain. While the\namygdala\u2019s reactions come in spurts and then subside, reactions from the prefrontal cortex are more gradual and constant. The\nbiggest difference between people who guide their own personal evolution and achieve their goals and those who don\u2019t is that\n\nthose who make progress reflect on what causes their amygdala hijackings.\n\f"}, "001427.png": {"text": "d. Choose your habits well. Habit is probably the most powerful tool in your brain\u2019s toolbox. It is driven by a golf-ball-sized lump of tissue\ncalled the basal ganglia at the base of the cerebrum. It is so deep-seated and instinctual that we are not conscious of it, though it\ncontrols our actions.\n\nIf you do just about anything frequently enough over time, you will form a habit that will control you. Good habits are those\nthat get you to do what your \u201cupper-level you\u201d wants, and bad habits are those that are controlled by your \u201clower-level you\u201d and\nstand in the way of your getting what your \u201cupper-level you\u201d wants. You can create a better set of habits if you understand how\nthis part of your brain works. For example, you can develop a habit that will make you \u201cneed\u201d to work out at the gym.\n\nDeveloping this skill takes some work. The first step is recognizing how habits develop in the first place. Habit is essentially in-\nertia, the strong tendency to keep doing what you have been doing (or not doing what you have not been doing). Research suggests\nthat if you stick with a behavior for approximately eighteen months, you will build a strong tendency to stick to it nearly forever.\n\nFor a long time, I didn\u2019t appreciate the extent to which habits control people\u2019s behavior. I experienced this at Bridgewater in\nthe form of people who agreed with our work principles in the abstract but had trouble living by them; I also observed it with\nfriends and family members who wanted to achieve something but constantly found themselves working against their own best\ninterests.\n\nThen I read Charles Duhigg\u2019s best-selling book The Power of Habit, which really opened my eyes. I recommend that you read\nit yourself if your interest in this subject goes deeper than what I\u2019m able to cover here. Duhigg\u2019s core idea is the role of the three-\nstep \u201chabit loop.\u201d The first step is a cue\u2014some \u201ctrigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use,\u201d\naccording to Duhigg. Step two is the routine, \u201cwhich can be physical or mental or emotional.\u201d Finally, there is a reward, which helps\nyour brain figure out if this particular loop is \u201cworth remembering for the future.\u201d Repetition reinforces this loop until over time it\nbecomes automatic. This anticipation and craving is the key to what animal trainers call operant conditioning, which is a method\nof training that uses positive reinforcement. For example, dog trainers use a sound (typically a clicker) to reinforce behavior by\n\npairing that sound with a more desirable reward (typically food) until the dog will perform the desired behavior when it merely\n\f"}, "001428.png": {"text": "hears the click. In humans, Duhigg says, rewards can be just about anything, ranging \u201cfrom food or drugs that cause physical sen-\n\nsations, to emotional payoffs, such as the feelings of pride that accompany praise or self-congratulation.\u201d\n\f"}, "001429.png": {"text": "LEFT BRAIN\n\nLOGICAL\n\nMATH\n+ SCIENCE-MINDED\n\nREALISM\nPREDOMINATES\n\nPLANNED\n+ ORDERLY\n\nPREFERS\nNON-FICTION\n\nFOCUSED\nON FACTS\n\nRIGHT BRAIN\n\nEMOTIONAL\n\nARTISTIC\n+ CREATIVE\n\nIMAGINATION\nPREDOMINATES\n\nOCCASIONALLY\nABSENTMINDED\n\nPREFERS\nFICTION\n\nENJOYS CREATIVE\nSTORYTELLING\n\f"}, "001430.png": {"text": "Habits put your brain on \u201cautomatic pilot.\u201d In neuroscientific terms, the basal ganglia takes over from your cortex, so that you\ncan execute activities without even thinking about them.\n\nReading Duhigg\u2019s book taught me that if you really want to change, the best thing you can do is choose which habits to acquire\nand which to get rid of and then go about doing that. To help you, I recommend that you write down your three most harmful\nhabits. Do that right now. Now pick one of those habits and be committed to breaking it. Can you do that? That would be extraordi-\nnarily impactful. If you break all three, you will radically improve the trajectory of your life. Or you can pick habits that you want\nto acquire and then acquire them.\n\nThe most valuable habit I\u2019ve acquired is using pain to trigger quality reflections. If you can acquire this habit yourself, you will\n\nlearn what causes your pain and what you can do about it, and it will have an enormous impact on your effectiveness.\n\ne. Train your \u201clower-level you\u201d with kindness and persistence to build the right habits. I used to think that the upper-level you needed to fight with the\nlower-level you to gain control, but over time I\u2019ve learned that it is more effective to train that subconscious, emotional you the\nsame way you would teach a child to behave the way you would like him or her to behave\u2014with loving kindness and persistence so\n\nthat the right habits are acquired.\n\nf. Understand the differences between right-brained and left-brained thinking. Just as your brain has its conscious upper part and its subconscious\nlower part, it also has two halves called hemispheres.*\u00b0 You might have heard it said that some people are more left-brained while\nothers are more right-brained. That\u2019s not just a saying\u2014Caltech professor Roger Sperry won the Nobel Prize in medicine for discov-\n\nering it. In a nutshell:\n\n1. The left hemisphere reasons sequentially, analyzes details, and excels at linear analysis. \u201cLeft-brained\u201d or \u201clinear\u201d thinkers\n\nwho are analytically strong are often called \u201cbright.\u201d\n\f"}, "001431.png": {"text": "2. The right hemisphere thinks across categories, recognizes themes, and synthesizes the big picture. \u201cRight-brained\u201d or \u201clat-\n\neral\u201d thinkers with more street smarts are often called \u201csmart.\u201d\n\nThe diagram on the left summarizes the qualities of \u201cright-brained\u201d and \u201cleft-brained\u201d thinking types.\n\nMost people tend to get more of their instructions from one side than the other and they have trouble understanding people\nwho get theirs from the opposite side. Our experience has been that left-brained folks tend to see right-brained folks as \u201cspacey\u201d or\n\u201cabstract,\u201d while right-brained thinkers tend to find left-brained thinkers \u201cliteral\u201d or \u201cnarrow.\u201d I have seen wonderful results occur\nwhen people know where their own and others\u2019 inclinations lie, realize that both ways of thinking are invaluable, and assign re-\n\nsponsibilities accordingly.\n\ng. Understand how much the brain can and cannot change. This brings us to an important question: Can we change?! We can all learn new facts\nand skills, but can we also learn to change how we are inclined to think? The answer is a qualified yes.\n\nBrain plasticity is what allows your brain to change its \u201csoftwiring.\u201d For a long time, scientists believed that after a certain criti-\ncal period in childhood, most of our brain\u2019s neurological connections were fixed and highly unlikely to change. But recent research\nhas suggested that a wide variety of practices\u2014from physical exercise to studying to meditation\u2014can lead to physical and physio-\nlogical changes in our brains that affect our abilities to think and form memories. In a study of Buddhist monks who had practiced\nmore than ten thousand hours of meditation, researchers at the University of Wisconsin measured significantly higher levels of\ngamma waves in their brains; these waves are associated with perception and problem solving.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the brain is infinitely flexible. If you have a preference for a certain way of thinking, you might be able to\ntrain yourself to operate another way and find that easier to do over time, but you're very unlikely to change your underlying pref-\nerence. Likewise, you may be able to train yourself to be more creative, but if you\u2019re not naturally creative, there\u2019s likely a limit to\nwhat you can do. That is simply reality, so we all might as well accept it and learn how to deal with it. There are coping techniques\n\nthat we can use\u2014for example, the creative, disorganized person who is likely to lose track of time can develop the habit of using\n\f"}, "001432.png": {"text": "alarms; the person who isn\u2019t good at some type of thinking can train himself to rely on the thinking of others who are better at it.\nThe best way to change is through doing mental exercises. As with physical exercise, this can be painful unless you enlist the habit\nloop discussed earlier to connect the rewards to the actions, \u201crewiring\u201d your brain to love learning and beneficial change.\n\nRemember that accepting your weaknesses is contrary to the instincts of those parts of your brain that want to hold on to the\nillusion that you are perfect. Doing the things that will reduce your instinctual defensiveness takes practice, and requires operat-\ning in an environment that reinforces open-mindedness.\n\nAs you'll see when we get into Work Principles, I've developed a number of tools and techniques that help overcome that re-\nsistance, individually and across organizations. Instead of expecting yourself or others to change, I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s often most\neffective to acknowledge one\u2019s weaknesses and create explicit guardrails against them. This is typically a faster and higher-proba-\n\nbility path to success.\n\n4.4 Find out what you and others are like.\n\nBecause of the biases with which we are wired, our self-assessments (and our assessments of others) tend to be highly inaccurate.\nPsychometric assessments are much more reliable. They are important in helping explore how people think during the hiring\nprocess and throughout employment. Though psychometric assessments cannot fully replace speaking with people and looking\nat their backgrounds and histories, they are far more powerful than traditional interviewing and screening methods. If I had to\nchoose between just the assessments or just traditional job interviews to get at what people are like, I would choose the assess-\nments. Fortunately, we don\u2019t have to make that choice.\n\nThe four main assessments we use are the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the Workplace Personality Inventory, the Team\nDimensions Profile, and Stratified Systems Theory.? But we are constantly experimenting (for example, with the Big Five) so our\n\nmix will certainly change. Whatever the mix, they all convey people\u2019s preferences for thinking and action. They also provide us\n\f"}, "001433.png": {"text": "with new attributes and terminologies that clarify and amplify those we had identified on our own. I will describe a few of them\nbelow. These descriptions are based on my own experiences and learnings, which are in many ways different from the official de-\n\nscriptions used by the assessment companies.**\n\na. Introversion vs. extroversion. Introverts focus on the inner world and get their energy from ideas, memories, and experiences while\nextroverts are externally focused and get their energy from being with people. Introversion and extroversion are also linked to\ndifferences in communication styles. If you have a friend who loves to \u201ctalk out\u201d ideas (and even has trouble thinking through\nsomething if there isn\u2019t someone around to work it through with), he or she is likely an extrovert. Introverts will usually find such\nconversations painful, preferring to think privately and share only after they\u2019ve worked things out on their own. I\u2019ve found that it\nis important to help each communicate in the way that they feel most comfortable. For example, introverts often prefer communi-\n\ncating in writing (such as email) rather than speaking in group settings and tend to be less open with their critical thoughts.\n\nb. Intuiting vs. sensing. Some people see big pictures (forests) and others see details (trees). In the Myers-Briggs framework, these ways\nof seeing are best represented by the continuum from intuiting to sensing. You can get an idea of people\u2019s preferences by observ-\ning what they focus on. For example, when reading, a sensing person who focuses on details can be thrown off by typos such as\n\u201cthere\u201d instead of \u201ctheir,\u201d while intuitive thinkers won\u2019t even notice the mistake. That is because the intuitive thinker\u2019s attention is\nfocused on the context first and the details second. Naturally, you'd rather have a sensing person than an intuitor preparing your\n\nlegal documents, where every \u201ci\u201d must be properly dotted and every \u201ct\u201d crossed just so.\n\nc. Thinking vs. feeling. Some people make decisions based on logical analysis of objective facts, considering all the known, provable\nfactors important to a given situation and using logic to determine the best course of action. This approach is an indicator of a\npreference for thinking and is how you'd hope your doctor thinks when he makes a diagnosis. Other people\u2014who prefer feeling\n\n\u2014focus on harmony between people. They are better suited to roles that require lots of empathy, interpersonal contact, and rela-\n\f"}, "001434.png": {"text": "tionship building, for example HR and customer service. Before we had assessments to identify these differences, conversations\nbetween \u201cTs\u201d and \u201cFs\u201d were really frustrating. Now we laugh as we bump up against our differences, because we know what they\n\nare and can see them playing out in classic ways.\n\nd. Planning vs. perceiving. Some people like to live in a planned, orderly way and others prefer flexibility and spontaneity.*= Planners (or\n\u201cJudgers\u201d in Myers-Briggs terms) like to focus on a plan and stick with it, while perceivers are prone to focus on what\u2019s happening\naround them and adapt to it. Perceivers work from the outside in; they see things happening and work backward to understand\nthe cause and how to respond; they also see many possibilities that they compare and choose from\u2014often so many that they are\nconfused by them. In contrast, planners work from the inside out, first figuring out what they want to achieve and then how\nthings should unfold. Planners and perceivers have trouble appreciating each other. Perceivers see new things and change direc-\ntion often. This is discomforting to planners, who weigh precedent much more heavily in their decision making, and assume if it\nwas done in a certain way before, it should be done in the same way again. Similarly, planners can discomfort perceivers by being\n\nseemingly rigid and slow to adapt.\n\ne. Creators vs. refiners vs. advancers vs. executors vs. flexors. By identifying talents and preferences that lead people to feel a particular way,\nyou can place them in jobs at which they will likely excel. At Bridgewater, we use a test called the \u201cTeam Dimensions Profile\u201d (TDP)\nto connect people with their preferred role. The five types identified by the TDP are Creators, Refiners, Advancers, Executors, and\n\nFlexors.\n\n+ Creators generate new ideas and original concepts. They prefer unstructured and abstract activities and thrive on innovation\nand unconventional practices.\n+ Advancers communicate these new ideas and carry them forward. They relish feelings and relationships and manage the\n\nhuman factors. They are excellent at generating enthusiasm for work.\n\f"}, "001435.png": {"text": "+ Refiners challenge ideas. They analyze projects for flaws, then refine them with a focus on objectivity and analysis. They love\nfacts and theories and working with a systematic approach.\n\n+ Executors can also be thought of as Implementers. They ensure that important activities are carried out and goals accom-\nplished; they are focused on details and the bottom line.\n\n+ Flexors are a combination of all four types. They can adapt their styles to fit certain needs and are able to look at a problem\n\nfrom a variety of perspectives.\n\nTriangulating what I learn from each test reinforces or raises questions about the pictures of people I\u2019m forming in my head.\nFor example, when people\u2019s MBTI results suggest a preference for \u201cS\u201d (focus on details) and \u201cJ\u201d (planful), and they come out as ex-\necutors on the Team Dimension assessment, there is a very good chance that they are more detail-focused than right-brained and\n\nimaginative, which means that they would likely fit better in jobs that have less ambiguity and more structure and clarity.\n\nf. Focusing on tasks vs. focusing on goals. Some people are focused on daily tasks while others are focused on their goals and how to achieve\nthem. I\u2019ve found these differences to be quite similar to the differences between people who are intuitive vs. sensing. Those who\ntend to focus on goals and \u201cvisualize\u201d best can see the big pictures over time and are also more likely to make meaningful changes\nand anticipate future events. These goal-oriented people can step back from the day-to-day and reflect on what and how they\u2019re\ndoing. They are the most suitable for creating new things (organizations, projects, etc.) and managing organizations that have lots\nof change. They typically make the most visionary leaders because of their ability to take a broad view and see the whole picture.\nIn contrast, those who tend to focus on daily tasks are better at managing things that don\u2019t change much or that require pro-\ncesses to be completed reliably. Task-oriented people tend to make incremental changes that reference what already exists. They\nare slower to depart from the status quo and more likely to be blindsided by sudden events. On the other hand, they\u2019re typically\n\nmore reliable. Although it may seem that their focus is narrower than higher-level thinkers, the roles they play are no less critical. 1\n\f"}, "001436.png": {"text": "would never have gotten this book out or accomplished hardly anything else worthwhile if I didn\u2019t work with people who are won-\n\nderful at taking care of details.\n\ng. Workplace Personality Inventory. Another assessment we use is the Workplace Personality Inventory, a test based on data from the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor. It anticipates behavior and predicts job fit and satisfaction, singling out certain key characteristics/qualities,\nincluding persistence, independence, stress tolerance, and analytical thinking. This test helps us understand what people value\nand how they will make trade-offs between their values. For example, someone with low Achievement Orientation and high Con-\ncern for Others might be unwilling to step on others\u2019 toes in order to accomplish their goals. Likewise, someone who is bad at Rule\nFollowing may be more likely to think independently.\n\nWe have found that something like twenty-five to fifty attributes can pretty well describe what a person is like. Each one comes\nin varying degrees of strength (like color tones). If you know what they are and put them together correctly, they will paint a\npretty complete picture of a person. Our objective is to use test results and other information to try to do just that. We prefer to\ndo it in partnership with the person being looked at, because it helps us be more accurate and at the same time it\u2019s very helpful to\nthem to see themselves objectively.\n\nCertain attributes combine frequently to produce recognizable archetypes. If you think about it, you can probably come up\nwith a handful of archetypal people you meet over and over again in life: the spacey, impractical Artist; the tidy Perfectionist; the\nCrusher who runs through brick walls to get things done; the Visionary who pulls amazing big ideas seemingly out of the air. Over\ntime I came up with a list of others, including Shaper, Chirper, Tweaker, and Open-Minded Learner, as well as Advancer, Creator,\nCat-Herder, Gossiper, Loyal Doer, Wise Judge, and others.\n\nTo be clear, archetypes are less useful than the better fleshed-out pictures created through the assessments. They are not\nprecise; they are more like simple caricatures, but they can be useful when it comes to assembling teams. Individual people will\n\nalways be more complex than the archetypes that describe them, and they may well match up with more than one. For example,\n\f"}, "001437.png": {"text": "the Spacey Artist may or may not also be a Perfectionist or may be a Crusher too. While I won't go over all of them, I will describe\n\nShapers\u2014the one that best represents me\u2014in some depth.\n\nh. Shapers are people who can go from visualization to actualization. I wrote a lot about the people I call \u201cshapers\u201d in the first part of this book. I use\nthe word to mean someone who comes up with unique and valuable visions and builds them out beautifully, typically over the\ndoubts of others. Shapers get both the big picture and the details right. To me, it seems that Shaper = Visionary + Practical Thinker\n+ Determined.\n\nT\u2019ve found that shapers tend to share attributes such as intense curiosity and a compulsive need to make sense of things, inde-\npendent thinking that verges on rebelliousness, a need to dream big and unconventionally, a practicality and determination to\npush through all obstacles to achieve their goals, and a knowledge of their own and others\u2019 weaknesses and strengths so they can\norchestrate teams to achieve them. Perhaps even more importantly, they can hold conflicting thoughts simultaneously and look at\nthem from different angles.

For example, think about how you choose and maintain a safe dis-\ntance behind the car in front of you when you are driving. Now describe the process in enough detail that someone who has never\ndriven a car before can do it as well as you can, or so that it can be programmed into the computer that controls an autonomous car.\nIbet you can\u2019t.\n\nNow think about the challenge of making all of your decisions well, in a systematic, repeatable way, and then being able to de-\nscribe the processes so clearly and precisely that anyone else can make the same quality decisions under the same circumstances.\nThat is what I aspire to do and have found to be invaluable, even when highly imperfect.\n\nWhile there is no one best way to make decisions, there are some universal rules for good decision making.

As explained in Chapter One, your brain stores different types of learning in your subcon-\nscious, your rote memory bank, and your habits. But no matter how you acquire your knowledge or where you store it, what\u2019s most\nimportant is that what you know paints a true and rich picture of the realities that will affect your decision. That\u2019s why it always\npays to be radically open-minded and seek out believable others as you do your learning. Many people have emotional trouble\ndoing this and block the learning that could help them make better decisions. Remind yourself that it\u2019s never harmful to at least\nhear an opposing point of view.\n\nDeciding is the process of choosing which knowledge should be drawn upon\u2014both the facts of this particular \u201cwhat is\u201d and\nyour broader understanding of the cause-effect machinery that underlies it\u2014and then weighing them to determine a course of\naction, the \u201cwhat to do about it.\u201d This involves playing different scenarios through time to visualize how to get an outcome con-\nsistent with what you want. To do this well, you need to weigh first-order consequences against second- and third-order conse-\nquences, and base your decisions not just on near-term results but on results over time.\n\nFailing to consider second- and third-order consequences is the cause of a lot of painfully bad decisions, and it is especially\ndeadly when the first inferior option confirms your own biases. Never seize on the first available option, no matter how good it\nseems, before you\u2019ve asked questions and explored. To prevent myself from falling into this trap, I used to literally ask myself\nquestions: Am I learning? Have I learned enough yet that it\u2019s time for deciding? After a while, you will just naturally and open-\nmindedly gather all the relevant info, but in doing so you will have avoided the first pitfall of bad decision making, which is to sub-\nconsciously make the decision first and then cherry-pick the data that supports it.\n\nBut how does one learn well?\n\f"}, "001443.png": {"text": "LEARNING WELL\n\nFor me, getting an accurate picture of reality ultimately comes down to two things: being able to synthesize accurately and know-\ning how to navigate levels.\n\nSynthesis is the process of converting a lot of data into an accurate picture. The quality of your synthesis will determine the\nquality of your decision making. This is why it always pays to triangulate your views with people who you know synthesize well.\nThis raises your chances of having a good synthesis, even if you feel like you've already done it yourself. No sensible person should\nreject a believable person's views without great fear of being wrong.\n\nTo synthesize well, you must 1) synthesize the situation at hand, 2) synthesize the situation through time, and 3) navigate lev-\n\nels effectively.\n\n5.2 Synthesize the situation at hand.\n\nEvery day you are faced with an infinite number of things that come at you.

For example, when choosing which movie to watch or what book to read, are you drawn to proven\n\nclassics or the newest big thing? In my opinion, it is smarter to choose the great over the new.\n\ne. Don't oversqueeze dots. A dot is just one piece of data from one moment in time; keep that in perspective as you synthesize.

They say \u201cit\u2019s\n\ngetting better\u201d without noticing how far below the bar it is and whether the rate of change will get it above the bar in an acceptable\namount of time. If someone who has been getting grades of 30s and 40s on their tests raised their scores to 50s over the course of a\nfew months it would be accurate to say that they are getting better, but they would still be woefully inadequate.

To make good decisions, you need to understand the reality of which of these two cases is happening.\n\nb. Be imprecise. Understand the concept of \u201cby-and-large\u201d and use approximations. Because our educational system is hung up on\nprecision, the art of being good at approximations is insufficiently valued. This impedes conceptual thinking. For example, when\nasked to multiply 38 by 12, most people do it the slow and hard way rather than simply rounding 38 up to 40, rounding 12 down\nto 10, and quickly determining that the answer is about 400. Look at the ice cream shop example and imagine the value of quickly\nseeing the approximate relationships between the dots versus taking the time to see all the edges precisely. It would be silly to\nspend time doing that, yet that\u2019s exactly what most people do. \u201cBy-and-large\u201d is the level at which you need to understand most\nthings in order to make effective decisions.

Now let\u2019s go up a level and examine deciding.\n\nDECIDE WELL\n\nUsing decision-making logic to produce the best long-term outcomes has become its own science\u2014one that employs probabilities\nand statistics, game theory, and other tools. While many of these tools are helpful, the fundamentals of effective decision making\nare relatively simple and timeless\u2014in fact they are genetically encoded in our brains to varying degrees. Watch animals in the wild\nand you'll see that they instinctively make expected value calculations to optimize the energy they expend to find food. Those that\ndid this well prospered and passed on their genes through the process of natural selection; those that did it poorly perished. While\nmost humans who do this badly won't perish, they will certainly be penalized by the process of economic selection.\n\nAs previously explained, there are two broad approaches to decision making: evidence/logic-based (which comes from the\n\nhigher- level brain) and subconscious/emotion-based (which comes from the lower-level animal brain).\n\f"}, "001456.png": {"text": "5.5 Logic, reason, and common sense are your best tools for synthesizing\n\nreality and understanding what to do about it.\n\nBe wary of relying on anything else. Unfortunately, numerous tests by psychologists show that the majority of people follow the\nlower-level path most of the time, which leads to inferior decisions without their realizing it. As Carl Jung put it, \u201cUntil you make\nthe unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.\u201d It\u2019s even more important that decision making be ev-\nidence-based and logical when groups of people are working together. If it\u2019s not, the process will inevitably be dominated by the\nmost powerful rather than the most insightful participants, which is not only unfair but suboptimal. Successful organizations\n\nhave cultures in which evidence-based decision making is the norm rather than the exception.\n\n5.6 Make your decisions as expected value calculations.\n\nThink of every decision as a bet with a probability and a reward for being right and a probability and a penalty for being wrong.\nNormally a winning decision is one with a positive expected value, meaning that the reward times its probability of occurring is\ngreater than the penalty times its probability of occurring, with the best decision being the one with the highest expected value.\nLet\u2019s say the reward for being right is $100 and its probability is 60 percent, while the penalty for being wrong is also $100. If\nyou multiply the reward by the probability of being right you get $60 and if you multiply the penalty by the probability of being\nwrong (40 percent) you get $40. If you subtract the penalty from the reward, the difference is the expected value, which in this\ncase is positive (+$20). Once you understand expected value, you also understand that it\u2019s not always best to bet on what\u2019s most\n\nprobable. For example, suppose something that has only a one-in-five chance (20 percent) of succeeding will return ten times (e.g.,\n\f"}, "001457.png": {"text": "$1,000) the amount that it will cost you if it fails ($100). Its expected value is positive ($120), so it\u2019s probably a smart decision,\neven though the odds are against you, as long as you can also cover the loss. Play these probabilities over and over again and they\nwill surely give you winning results over time.\n\nThough we mostly don\u2019t carry out these calculations explicitly, we constantly make them intuitively. For example, when you\ndecide to take an umbrella to the store even though there\u2019s just a 40 percent chance of rain, or you check your phone to confirm the\ndirections somewhere, even though you're almost certain you know the way, you're making expected value calculations.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s smart to take a chance even when the odds are overwhelmingly against you if the cost of being wrong is negligi-\nble relative to the reward that comes with the slim chance of being right. As the saying goes, \u201cIt never hurts to ask.\u201d\n\nThis principle made a big difference in my own life. Years ago, when I was just starting my family, I saw a house that was perfect\nfor us in every way. The problem was that it wasn\u2019t on the market and everyone I asked told me the owner wasn\u2019t interested in\nselling.

The\nexpected value gain from raising the probability of being right from 51 percent to 85 percent (i.e., by 34 percentage points) is sev-\nenteen times more than raising the odds of being right from 49 percent (which is probably wrong) to 51 percent (which is only a\n\nlittle more likely to be right).

If you disagree on the principles, try\nto work through your disagreement based on your respective believabilities.

Even back in the 1970s, when I first started experimenting with computerized\ndecision making, it had already been around for nearly twenty years (the term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d was first introduced in 1956\nat aconference at Dartmouth College). While a lot has changed since then, the basic concepts remain the same.\n\nTo give you just one ultrasimple example of how computerized decision making works, let\u2019s say you have two principles for\nheating your home: You want to turn the heat on when the temperature falls below 68 and you want to turn the heat off between\nmidnight and 5:00 a.m. You can express the relationship between these criteria in a simple decision-making formula: If the tem-\nperature is less than 68 degrees and the time is not between 5:00 a.m. and midnight, then turn on the heat.

In time, we will use\nmachine assistants as much for decision making as we do for information gathering today. As these machines help us, they will\nlearn about what we are like\u2014what we value, what our strengths and weaknesses are\u2014and they will be able to tailor the advice\nthey give us by automatically seeking out the help of others who are strong where we are weak.

We'll soon be able to do\nthis. Before too long, you will be able to tap the highest-quality thinking on nearly every issue you face and get the guidance of a\ncomputerized system that weighs different points of view. For example, you will be able to ask what lifestyle or career you should\nchoose given what you're like, or how to best interact with specific people based on what they\u2019re like. These innovations will help\npeople get out of their own heads and unlock an incredibly powerful form of collective thinking. We are doing this now and have\nfound it way better than traditional thinking.\n\nWhile this kind of view often leads to talk of artificial intelligence competing with human intelligence, in my opinion human\nand artificial intelligence are far more likely to work together because that will produce the best results.

Only you know\nwhat you value most, who you want to share your life with, what kind of environment you want to be in, and ultimately how to\nmake the best choices to bring those things about.

I categorize what is going on in the world of\ncomputer-aided decision making under three broad types: expert systems, mimicking, and data mining (these categories are mine\nand not the ones in common use in the technology world).\n\nExpert systems are what we use at Bridgewater, where designers specify criteria based on their logical understandings of a set of\ncause-effect relationships, and then see how different scenarios would emerge under different circumstances.\n\nBut computers can also observe patterns and apply them in their decision making without having any understanding of the\nlogic behind them.

While this approach is popular, it\u2019s risky in cases when the future might be\ndifferent from the past. Investment systems built on machine learning that is not accompanied by deep understanding are dan-\ngerous because when some decision rule is widely believed, it becomes widely used, which affects the price. In other words, the\nvalue of a widely known insight disappears over time. Without deep understanding, you won't know if what happened in the past\nis genuinely of value and, even if it was, you will not be able to know whether or not its value has disappeared\u2014or worse.

Given enough computing power, all possible variables can be taken into consideration.

A great organization has both great people and a great culture. Companies that get progressively better over time have both. Nothing is more\n\nimportant or more difficult than to get the culture and people right.\n\nb. Great people have both great character and great capabilities. By great character, I mean they are radically truthful, radically transparent, and\ndeeply committed to the mission of the organization. By great capabilities, I mean they have the abilities and skills to do their jobs\nexcellently. People who have one without the other are dangerous and should be removed from the organization. People who have\n\nboth are rare and should be treasured.\n\nc. Great cultures bring problems and disagreements to the surface and solve them well, and they love imagining and building great things that haven't been built before.\nDoing that sustains their evolution. In our case, we do that by having an idea meritocracy that strives for meaningful work and\nmeaningful relationships through radical truth and radical transparency. By meaningful work, I mean work that people are ex-\ncited to get their heads into, and by meaningful relationships I mean those in which there is genuine caring for each other (like an\nextended family). I find that these reinforce each other and that being radically truthful and radically transparent with each other\nmakes both the work and the relationships go better.\n\nBy constantly looking down on the machine, its managers can objectively compare the outcomes it produces with their goals. If\nthose outcomes are consistent with those goals, then the machine is working effectively; if the outcomes are inconsistent with the\ngoals, then something is wrong with either the design of the machine or the people who are a part of it and the problem needs to be\ndiagnosed so the machine can be modified. As laid out in Chapter Two of Life Principles, this ideally happens in a 5-Step Process: 1)\nhaving clear goals, 2) identifying the problems preventing the goals from being achieved, 3) diagnosing what parts of the machine\n(ie., which people or which designs) are not working well, 4) designing changes, and 5) doing what is needed. This is the fastest\nand most efficient way that an organization improves.\n\nIcall this process of converting problems into progress \u201clooping,\u201d and how it happens through time is visualized in the diagrams\n\nto the right. In the first, a problem occurs that takes you off track from your goals and makes things worse than you planned.\n\f"}, "001505.png": {"text": "If you identify the decline, diagnose the problems that caused it so as to get at their root causes, come up with new designs, and\nthen push them through, the trajectory will loop back on itself and continue its upward ascent, like in the second diagram.\n\nIf you don\u2019t identify the problem, design a suboptimal solution, or fail to push it through effectively, the decline will continue as\nshown in the diagram at the bottom.\n\nAmanager\u2019s ability to recognize when outcomes are inconsistent with goals and then modify designs and assemble people to\nrectify them makes all the difference in the world. The more often and more effectively a manager does this, the steeper the up-\nward trajectory.\n\nAs I explained in Life Principles, this is what I believe evolution looks like for all organisms and organizations. Having a culture\nand people that will evolve in this way is critical because the world changes quickly and in ways that can\u2019t possibly be anticipated.\nI\u2019m sure you can think of a number of companies that failed to identify and address their problems on time and ended up ina\nterminal decline (see: BlackBerry and Palm) and a rare few that have consistently looped well.

That is the process I want to\npass along to you.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, nothing is more important or more difficult than to get the culture and the people right. Whatever suc-\ncesses we've had at Bridgewater were the result of doing that well\u2014and whatever failures were due to our not doing it adequately.\nThat might seem odd because, as a global macroeconomic investor, one might think that, above all else, I had to get the economics\nand investments right, which is true. But to do that, I needed to get the people and culture right first. And, to inspire me to do what\nI did, Ineeded to have meaningful work and meaningful relationships.\n\nAs the entrepreneur/builder of Bridgewater, I naturally shaped the organization to be consistent with my values and principles.\nI went after what I wanted most, in the way that seemed most natural to me with the people I chose to be with, and we and Bridge-\nwater evolved together.\n\nIf you had asked me what my objective was when I started out, I would\u2019ve said it was to have fun working with people I like.\nWork was a game I played with passion and I wanted to have a blast playing it with people I enjoyed and respected. I started Bridge-\nwater out of my apartment with a pal I played rugby with who had no experience in the markets and a friend we hired as our as-\nsistant. I certainly wasn\u2019t thinking about management at the time. Management seemed to me like something people in gray suits\nwith slide presentations did. I never set out to manage, let alone to have principles about work and management.\n\nFrom reading Life Principles, you know that I liked to imagine and build out new, practical concepts that never existed before.\n\nI especially loved doing these things with people who were on the same mission with me. I treasured thoughtful disagreement\nwith them as a way of learning and raising our odds of making good decisions, and I wanted all the people I worked with to be my\n\u201cpartners\u201d rather than my \u201cemployees.\u201d In a nutshell, I was looking for meaningful work and meaningful relationships. I quickly\nlearned that the best way to do that was to have great partnerships with great people.\n\nTo me, great partnerships come from sharing common values and interests, having similar approaches to pursuing them, and\n\nbeing reasonable with, and having consideration for, each other. At the same time, partners must be willing to hold each other\n\f"}, "001509.png": {"text": "to high standards and work through their disagreements. The main test of a great partnership is not whether the partners ever\ndisagree\u2014people in all healthy relationships disagree\u2014but whether they can bring their disagreements to the surface and get\nthrough them well. Having clear processes for resolving disagreements efficiently and clearly is essential for business partner-\nships, marriages, and all other forms of partnership.\n\nMy wanting these things attracted others who wanted the same things, which drove how we shaped Bridgewater together.**\nWhen there were five of us it was totally different than when there were fifty of us, which was totally different than it was when\nwe were five hundred, a thousand, and so on. As we grew, most everything changed beyond recognition, except for our core values\nand principles.\n\nWhen Bridgewater was still a small company, the principles by which we operated were more implicit than explicit. But as more\nand more new people came in, I couldn\u2019t take for granted that they would understand and preserve them. I realized that I needed to\nwrite our principles out explicitly and explain the logic behind them. I remember the precise moment when this shift occurred\u2014it\nwas when the number of people at Bridgewater passed sixty-seven. Up until then, I had personally chosen each employee\u2019s holiday\ngift and written them a lengthy personalized card, but trying to do it that year broke my back. From that point on, an increasing\nnumber of people came in who didn\u2019t work closely with me, so I couldn\u2019t assume they would understand where I was coming from\n\nor what I was striving to create, which was an idea meritocracy built on tough love.\n\n* Tough love is effective for achieving both great work and great relationships.\n\nTo give you an idea of what I mean by tough love, think of Vince Lombardi, who for me personified it. From when I was ten years\nold until I was eighteen, Lombardi was head coach of the Green Bay Packers. With limited resources, he led his team to five NFL\n\nchampionships. He won two NFL Coach of the Year awards and many still call him the best coach of all time. Lombardi loved his\n\f"}, "001510.png": {"text": "players and he pushed them to be great. I admired, and still admire, how uncompromising his standards were. His players, their\n\nfans, and he himself all benefited from his approach. I wish Lombardi had written out his principles for me to read.\n\na. In order to be great, one can't compromise the uncompromisable. Yet I see people doing it all the time, usually to avoid making others or them-\nselves feel uncomfortable, which is not just backward but counterproductive. Putting comfort ahead of success produces worse\nresults for everyone. I both loved the people I worked with and pushed them to be great, and I expected them to do the same with\nme.\n\nFrom the very beginning, I felt that the people I worked with at Bridgewater were a part of my extended family. When they or\nmembers of their families got sick, I put them in touch with my personal doctor to make sure that they were well taken care of. Iin-\nvited all of them to stay at my house in Vermont on weekends and loved it when they took me up on it. I celebrated their marriages\nand the births of their children with them and mourned the losses of their loved ones. But to be clear, this was no lovefest. We were\ntough on each other too, so we could all be as great as we could be. I learned that the more caring we gave each other, the tougher\nwe could be on each other, and the tougher we were on each other, the better we performed and the more rewards there were for us\nto share. This cycle was self-reinforcing. I found that operating this way made the lows less low and the highs higher. It even made\nthe bad times better than the good ones in some important ways.\n\nThink about some of your toughest experiences in life. I bet it is as true for you as it has been for me that going through them\nwith people you cared about, who cared about you, and who were working as hard as you were for the same mission, was incred-\nibly rewarding. As hard as they were, we look back on some of these challenging times as our finest moments. For most people,\nbeing part of a great community on a shared mission is even more rewarding than money. Numerous studies have shown there\nis little to no correlation between one\u2019s happiness and the amount of money one accumulates, yet there is a strong correlation be-\ntween one\u2019s happiness and the quality of one\u2019s relationships.\n\nIlaid this out in a memo to Bridgewater in 1996:\n\f"}, "001511.png": {"text": "Bridgewater is not about plodding along at some kind of moderate standard, it is about working like hell to achieve a standard that\nis extraordinarily high, and then getting the satisfaction that comes along with that sort of super-achievement.\n\nOur overriding objective is excellence, or more precisely, constant improvement, a superb and constantly improving company\nin all respects.\n\nConflict in the pursuit of excellence is a terrific thing. There should be no hierarchy based on age or seniority. Power should lie\nin the reasoning, not the position, of the individual. The best ideas win no matter who they come from.\n\nCriticism (by oneself and by others) is an essential ingredient in the improvement process, yet, if handled incorrectly, can be\ndestructive. It should be handled objectively. There should be no hierarchy in the giving or receiving of criticism.\n\nTeamwork and team spirit are essential, including intolerance of substandard performance. This is referring to 1) one\u2019s recog-\nnition of the responsibilities one has to help the team achieve its common goals and 2) the willingness to help others (work within a\ngroup) toward these common goals. Our fates are intertwined. One should know that others can be relied upon to help.

There is comparatively little age- and seniority-based hierarchy.\n\nEach person at Bridgewater should act like an owner, responsible for operating in this way and for holding others accountable\n\nto operate in this way.\n\n+ A believability-weighted idea meritocracy is the best system for making effective decisions.\n\f"}, "001512.png": {"text": "Unlike Lombardi, whose success depended on having his players follow his instructions, I needed my players to be independent\nthinkers who could bang around their different points of view and reach better conclusions than any one of us could come up with\non our own. I needed to create an environment in which everyone had the right and the responsibility to make sense of things for\nthemselves and to fight openly for what they think is best\u2014and where the best thinking won out. I needed a real idea meritocracy,\nnot some theoretical version of one. That\u2019s because an idea meritocracy\u2014i.e., a system that brings together smart, independent\nthinkers and has them productively disagree to come up with the best possible collective thinking and resolve their disagreements\nin a believability-weighted way\u2014will outperform any other decision-making system.\n\nOur idea-meritocratic system evolved over the decades. At first, we just argued like hell with each other about what was best\nand by thrashing through our disagreements came up with better paths than if we had made our decisions individually. But as\nBridgewater grew and our range of disagreements and needs to resolve them changed, we became more explicit in how this idea\nmeritocracy would work. We needed a system that could both effectively weigh the believability of different people to come to\nthe best decisions and do that in a way that was so obviously fair everyone would recognize it as such. I knew that without such a\nsystem, we would lose both the best thinking and the best thinkers, and I\u2019d be stuck with either kiss-asses or subversives who kept\ntheir disagreements and hidden resentments to themselves.\n\nFor this all to work, I believed and still believe that we need to be radically truthful and radically transparent with each other.\n\nRADICAL TRUTH AND RADICAL TRANSPARENCY\n\nBy radical truth, I mean not filtering one\u2019s thoughts and one\u2019s questions, especially the critical ones.

We have always been unwavering in providing this envi-\nronment, and we let the people who didn\u2019t like it self-select themselves out of the company.\n\nBy being radically truthful and radically transparent, we could see that we all have terribly incomplete and/or distorted perspec-\ntives.

At first most people remain stuck in their own heads, stubbornly clinging to the idea that their\nviews are best and that something is wrong with other people who don\u2019t see things their way. But when they repeatedly face the\nquestions \u201cHow do you know that you're not the wrong one?\u201d and \u201cWhat process would you use to draw upon these different\nperspectives to make the best decisions?\u201d they are forced to confront their own believability and see things through others\u2019 eyes as\nwell as their own. This shift in perspective is what produces great collective decision making. Ideally, this takes place in an \u201copen-\nsource\u201d way, with the best ideas flowing freely, living, dying, and producing rapid evolution based on their merits.\n\nMost people initially find this process very uncomfortable.

Also,\nwhen people can\u2019t be totally open, they can\u2019t be themselves.

I have\ndone my best to bring you to this point; now is the time for you to step up and for me to fade away.\n\nIf you are outside Bridgewater and thinking about how these principles might apply to your organization, this book is meant to\nprompt your thinking, not to give you an exact formula to follow. You don\u2019t have to adopt all or any of these principles, though I do\nrecommend that you consider them all. Many people who run other organizations have adopted some of these principles, modified\nothers, and rejected many. Whatever you want to do with them is fine with me. These principles provide a framework you can\nmodify to suit your needs. Maybe you will pursue the same goal and maybe you won't; chances are that, in either case, you will\ncollect some valuable stuff. If you share my goal of having your organization be a real idea meritocracy, I believe this book will be\ninvaluable for you because I\u2019m told that no organization has thought through or pushed the concepts of how to make a real idea\nmeritocracy as far as Bridgewater. If doing that is important to you and you pursue it with unwavering determination you will en-\ncounter your own barriers, you will find your own ways around them, and you will get there, even if imperfectly.\n\nWhile these principles are good general rules, it\u2019s important to remember that every rule has exceptions and that no set of rules\ncan ever substitute for common sense. Think of these principles as being like a GPS. A GPS helps you get where you're going, but if\nyou follow it blindly off a bridge\u2014well, that would be your fault, not the GPS\u2019s.

In this section on culture I will share my thoughts on how to match your culture to your needs, and I will ex-\nplain the type of culture that I wanted and that has worked so well for me: an idea meritocracy.\n\nIn Chapter One, I explain what an idea meritocracy looks like, and explore why radical truth and radical transparency are essen-\ntial for it to work well. Being radically truthful and radically transparent are probably the most difficult principles to internalize,\nbecause they are so different from what most people are used to.

Besides\nbeing rewarding themselves, meaningful relationships enable the radical truth and transparency that allow us to hold each other\naccountable for producing excellence.\n\nIbelieve that great cultures, like great people, recognize that making mistakes is part of the process of learning, and that contin-\nuous learning is what allows an organization to evolve successfully over time.

But like most things in life, being radically truthful and transparent has\ncons as well as pros, which I will describe as accurately as possible in this chapter.\n\nBeing radically truthful and transparent with your colleagues and expecting your colleagues to be the same with you ensures\nthat important issues are apparent instead of hidden. It also enforces good behavior and good thinking, because when you have\nto explain yourself, everyone can openly assess the merits of your logic.

Our back office provides the services we need\n\nto support our trading in the markets, including trade confirmations, settlements, record maintenance, and accounting. We had\nbuilt this team up over many years and it was full of hardworking, close-knit employees who were part of our extended family. But\nat the time we were seeing a need for new capacities that would stretch us beyond what we could do in-house. This led our COO,\nEileen Murray, to devise an innovative strategy for spinning off this team and having them incorporated into a tailor-made group\nwithin the Bank of New York/Mellon. It was just an exploratory conversation at first; we had no idea whether we would pursue it,\nhow we would pursue it, or what that would ultimately mean for the members of our back office team.\n\nPut yourself in the shoes of the Management Committee. When would you tell the back office team that you were thinking of\nspinning off their group into another company? Would you wait until the picture was clear? In most organizations this kind of\nstrategic decision would typically be kept under wraps until it was a done deal, because bosses generally think it\u2019s bad to create\nuncertainty among employees. We believe the opposite: that the only responsible way to operate is truthfully and transparently,\nso that people know what\u2019s really going on and can help us sort through any issues that arise. In this case, Eileen led a town-hall\nmeeting with the back office team right away. In the way typical of leaders at Bridgewater, she explained that there was a lot she\ndidn\u2019t know and there were a lot of questions that she wouldn\u2019t be able to answer. This was the harsh reality at that moment, and\nwhile it did create uncertainty, had she followed the more traditional approach of being less open, the inevitable rumors and spec-\nulation would\u2019ve made things much worse.\n\nThough the group ultimately did get spun off, we continue to have wonderful relationships with the people in it. Not only did\nthey cooperate fully throughout the transition, they still come to our Christmas and Fourth of July parties and remain a part of our\nextended family. Today, we have an award-winning back office because of the innovative things this change allowed us to do. Most\nimportantly, since we were operating openly even while we hadn't figured things out, the back office team had their confidence in\n\nour truthfulness and consideration for them reinforced, and they returned it in kind.\n\f"}, "001531.png": {"text": "For me, not telling people what\u2019s really going on so as to protect them from the worries of life is like letting your kids grow into\nadulthood believing in the Tooth Fairy or Santa Claus. While concealing the truth might make people happier in the short run, it\nwon't make them smarter or more trusting in the long run. It\u2019s a real asset that people know they can trust what we say. For that\nreason I believe that it\u2019s almost always better to shoot straight, even when you don\u2019t have all the answers or when there\u2019s bad news\nto convey.

As scary as the truth\nmay turn out to be, you will be better off knowing it in the long run because it will allow you to seek the most appropriate treat-\nment. The same holds for learning painful truths about your own strengths and weaknesses. Knowing and acting on the truth is\nwhat we call the \u201cbig deal\u201d at Bridgewater. It\u2019s important not to get hung up on all those emotion- and ego-laden \u201clittle deals\u201d that\n\ncan distract you from the overall mission.\n\n1.2 Have integrity and demand it from others.\n\f"}, "001532.png": {"text": "Integrity comes from the Latin word integritas, meaning \u201cone\u201d or \u201cwhole.\u201d People who are one way on the inside and another way\non the outside\u2014i.e., not \u201cwhole\u201d\u2019\u2014lack integrity; they have \u201cduality\u201d instead. While presenting your view as something other than\nit is can sometimes be easier in the moment (because you can avoid conflict, or embarrassment, or achieve some other short-term\ngoal), the second- and third-order effects of having integrity and avoiding duality are immense. People who are one way on the\ninside and another on the outside become conflicted and often lose touch with their own values. It\u2019s difficult for them to be happy\nand almost impossible for them to be their best.\n\nAligning what you say with what you think and what you think with what you feel will make you much happier and much\nmore successful. Thinking solely about what\u2019s accurate instead of how it is perceived pushes you to focus on the most important\nthings. It helps you sort through people and places because you'll be drawn to people and places that are open and honest. It\u2019s also\nfairer to those around you: Making judgments about people so that they are tried and sentenced in your head, without asking for\n\ntheir perspective, is both unethical and unproductive.

Criticism is welcomed and\nencouraged at Bridgewater, but there is never a good reason to bad-mouth people behind their backs.

This is unhealthy and stands in the way of improvement because it prevents people\n\nfrom bringing their mistakes and weaknesses to the surface, encourages deception, and eliminates subordinates\u2019 right of appeal.\n\f"}, "001533.png": {"text": "The same thing applies to the idea of personal loyalty. I have regularly seen people kept in jobs that they don\u2019t deserve because\nof their personal relationship to the boss, and this leads to unscrupulous managers trading on personal loyalties to build fiefdoms\nfor themselves. Judging one person by a different set of rules than another is an insidious form of corruption that undermines the\nmeritocracy.\n\nI believe in a healthier form of loyalty founded on openly exploring what is true. Explicit, principled thinking and radical trans-\nparency are the best antidotes for self-dealing. When everyone is held to the same principles and decision making is done publicly,\nit is difficult for people to pursue their own interests at the expense of the organization\u2019s. In such an environment, those who face\ntheir challenges have the most admirable character; when mistakes and weaknesses are hidden, unhealthy character is rewarded\n\ninstead.\n\n1.3 Create an environment in which everyone has the right to understand what makes sense\n\nand no one has the right to hold a critical opinion without speaking up.\n\nWhether people have the independence and character to fight for the best answers will depend upon their nature, but youcan\n\nencourage them by creating an atmosphere in which everyone's first thought is to ask: \u201cIs it true?\u201d\n\na. Speak up, own it, or get out. In an idea meritocracy, openness is a responsibility; you not only have the privilege to speak up and \u201cfight\nfor right\u201d but are obliged to do so. This extends especially to principles. Just like everything else, principles need to be questioned\nand debated. What you're not allowed to do is complain and criticize privately\u2014either to others or in your own head. If you can't\n\nfulfill this obligation, then you must go.\n\f"}, "001534.png": {"text": "Of course open-mindedly exploring what\u2019s true with others is not the same thing as stubbornly insisting that only you are right,\neven after the decision-making machine has settled an issue and moved on.

Discuss your issues until you are in sync with each other or until you understand each other\u2019s positions and can\n\ndetermine what should be done. As someone I worked with once explained, \u201cIt\u2019s simple\u2014just don\u2019t filter.\u201d\n\nc. Don't be naive about dishonesty. People lie more than most people imagine. I learned that by being in the position of being responsible\nfor everyone in the company. While we have an exceptionally ethical group of people, in all organizations there are dishonest peo-\nple who have to be dealt with in practical ways. For example, don\u2019t believe most people who are caught being dishonest when they\nsay that they\u2019ve seen the light and will never do it again because chances are they will. Dishonest people are dangerous, so keeping\nthem around isn\u2019t smart.\n\nAt the same time, let\u2019s be practical. If I tried to limit my relationships to people who never lied, I\u2019d have nobody to work with.\nWhile I have extremely high standards when it comes to integrity, I don\u2019t view it in a black-white, one-strike-and-you\u2019re-out way.\nI look at the severity, the circumstances, and the patterns to try to understand whether I am dealing with a person who is a ha-\nbitual liar and will lie to me again, or with a person who is fundamentally honest yet imperfect. I consider the significance of the\ndishonesty itself (Was the person stealing a piece of cake or were they committing a felony?) as well as the nature of our existing\nrelationship (Is it my spouse telling the lie, a casual acquaintance, or an employee?). Treating such cases differently is appropriate\n\nbecause a basic law of justice is that the punishment should fit the crime.\n\n1.4 Be radically transparent.\n\f"}, "001535.png": {"text": "If you agree that a real idea meritocracy is an extremely powerful thing, it should not be a great leap for you to see that giving\npeople the right to see things for themselves is better than forcing them to rely on information processed for them by others. Rad-\nical transparency forces issues to the surface\u2014most importantly (and most uncomfortably) the problems that people are dealing\nwith and how they\u2019re dealing with them\u2014and it allows the organization to draw on the talents and insights of all its members to\nsolve them. Eventually, for people who get used to it, living in a culture of radical transparency is more comfortable than living in\nthe fog of not knowing what\u2019s going on and not knowing what people really think. And it is incredibly effective. But, to be clear, like\nmost great things it also has drawbacks. Its biggest drawback is that it is initially very difficult for most people to deal with uncom-\nfortable realities. If unmanaged, it can lead to people getting involved with more things than they should, and can lead people who\naren\u2019t able to weigh all the information to draw the wrong conclusions.\n\nFor example, bringing all an organization\u2019s problems to the surface and regarding every one of them as intolerable may lead\nsome people to wrongly conclude that their organization has more intolerable problems than another organization that keeps its\nissues under wraps. Yet which organization is more likely to achieve excellence? One that highlights its problems and considers\nthem intolerable or one that doesn\u2019t?\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: Radical transparency isn\u2019t the same as total transparency. It just means much more transparency than is\ntypical. We do keep some things confidential, such as private health matters or deeply personal problems, sensitive details about\nintellectual property or security issues, the timing of a major trade, and at least for the short term, matters that are likely to be\ndistorted, sensationalized, and harmfully misunderstood if leaked to the press. In the following principles, you will get a good ex-\nplanation of when and why we've found it helpful to be transparent and when and why we've found it inappropriate.\n\nFrankly, when I started off being so radically transparent, I had no idea how it would go; I just knew that it was extremely impor-\ntant and that I had to fight hard and find ways to make it happen. I pushed the limits and was surprised by how well it worked. For\nexample, when I started taping all our meetings our lawyers told us we were crazy because we were creating evidence that could be\nused against us in court or by regulators such as the SEC. In response, I theorized that radical transparency would reduce the risk\n\nof our doing anything wrong\u2014and of not dealing appropriately with our mistakes\u2014and that the tapes would in fact protect us. If\n\f"}, "001536.png": {"text": "we were handling things well, our transparency would make that clear (provided, of course, that all parties are reasonable, which\nisn\u2019t something you can always take for granted), and if we were handling things badly, our transparency would ensure that we\nwould get what we deserve, which, in the long run, would be good for us.\n\nI didn\u2019t know for sure at the time, but our experience has proven this theory correct time and again. Bridgewater has had\nuncommonly few legal or regulatory encounters, largely because of our radical transparency. That\u2019s because it\u2019s tougher to do bad\nthings and easier to find out what\u2019s true and resolve claims through radical transparency. Over the last several decades, we have\nnot hada single material legal or regulatory judgment against us.\n\nNaturally, growing bigger and more successful attracts more media attention, and reporters know that salacious and controver-\nsial stories draw more eyeballs than balanced ones. Bridgewater is especially vulnerable to this kind of reporting because, with our\nculture of bringing problems to the surface and sharing them transparently within the company, we leave ourselves open to leaks.\nWould it be better not to be transparent and so avoid such problems?\n\nT\u2019ve learned that the people whose opinions matter most are those who know us best\u2014our clients and our employees\u2014and that\nour radical transparency serves us well with them. Not only has it led to our producing better results, but it also builds trust with\nour employees and clients so that mischaracterizations in the press roll off their backs. When we discuss such situations with\nthem, they say that for us to not operate transparently would scare them much more.\n\nHaving this sort of understanding and support to do the right things has been immeasurably valuable. But we wouldn't have\n\nknown about these great payoffs if we hadn't so steadfastly pushed the limits of this truth and transparency.\n\na, Use transparency to help enforce justice. When everyone can follow the discussion leading up to a decision\u2014either in real time in person\nor via taped records and email threads\u2014justice is more likely to prevail. Everyone is held accountable for their thinking and any-\none can weigh in on who should do what according to shared principles. Absent such a transparent process, decisions would be\nsettled behind closed doors by those who have the power to do whatever they want. With transparency, everyone is held to the\n\nsame high standards.\n\f"}, "001537.png": {"text": "b. Share the things that are hardest to share. While it might be tempting to limit transparency to the things that can\u2019t hurt you, it is especially\nimportant to share the things that are most difficult to share, because if you don\u2019t share them you will lose the trust and partner-\nship of the people you are not sharing with. So, when faced with the decision to share the hardest things, the question should not\n\nbe whether to share but how. The following principles will help you do this well.\n\nc. Keep exceptions to radical transparency very rare. While I would like virtually total transparency and wish that everyone would handle\nthe information they have access to responsibly to work out what\u2019s true and what to do about it, I realize that\u2019s an ideal to be ap-\nproached but never fully achieved. There are exceptions to every rule, and in very rare cases, it is better not to be radically transpar-\nent. In those unusual cases, you will need to figure out a way that preserves the culture of radical transparency without exposing\nyou and those you care about to undue risks.\n\nWhen weighing an exception, approach it as an expected value calculation, taking into consideration the second- and third-\norder consequences. Ask yourself whether the costs of making the case transparent and managing the risks of that transparency\noutweigh the benefits. In the vast majority of cases, they don\u2019t. I\u2019ve found that the most common reasons to limit broad trans-\n\nparency are:\n\n1. Where the information is of a private, personal, or confidential nature and doesn\u2019t meaningfully impact the community at\nlarge.\n\n2. Where sharing and managing such information puts the long-term interests of the Bridgewater community, its clients, and\nour ability to uphold our principles at risk (for instance, our proprietary investment logic or a legal dispute).\n\n3. Where the value of sharing the information broadly with the community is very low and the distraction it would cause\n\nwould be significant (compensation, for instance).\n\f"}, "001538.png": {"text": "What I\u2019m saying is that I believe one should push the limits of being transparent while remaining prudent. Because we tape\nvirtually everything\u2014including our mistakes and weaknesses\u2014for everyone to see, we are a target-rich environment for media\nthat thrives on sensationalistic or critical gossip and can find ways of having information leaked to them. In one case when we\nfaced the problem of having information leaked to the press that was intentionally distorted and hurt our recruiting efforts, we\nwere forced to institute some controls on ultrasensitive information, so that only a significant number of ultratrustworthy peo-\nple received it in real time, and it was distributed to others after a delay. The information was the sort that, in a typical company,\nwould be shared with just a handful but at Bridgewater was shared with nearly a hundred trusted people. In other words, while\nour radical transparency in that case wasn\u2019t total, I pushed its limits in a practical way. It served us well because the people who\nmost needed the transparency got it right away and most everyone understood that the commitment to being transparent re-\nmained very much intact, even in challenging circumstances. People know that my intent is to always push the limits of trying to\nbe transparent and that the only things that would prevent me from doing that will be the interests of the company and that I will\ntell them ifI can\u2019t be transparent and why. It is in our culture to be that way and that fosters trust, even when the transparency is\n\nJess than we would like it to be.\n\nd. Make sure those who are given radical transparency recognize their responsibilities to handle it well and to weigh things intelligently.\n\nPeople cannot be given the privilege of receiving information and then use the information to harm the company, so rules and\nprocedures must be in place to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen. For example, we provide great transparency inside Bridgewater on\nthe condition that Bridgewater citizens do not leak it outside; if they do, they will be dismissed for cause (for unethical behavior).\nAdditionally, the rules for how issues are explored and decisions are made must be maintained, and because different people have\ndifferent perspectives, it\u2019s important that the paths for resolving them are followed. For example, some people are going to make\nbig deals out of little deals, come up with their own wrong theories, or have problems seeing how things are evolving.

Management should restrict transparency sparingly and wisely because every time they do, it undermines the\n\nidea meritocracy and people's trust.\n\n\u2018f. Don't share sensitive information with the organization's enemies.\n\nBoth inside and outside of any organization, there are some people who will intentionally cause the organization harm.

When you have\nsuch relationships with those you work with, you pull each other through challenging times; at the same time, sharing challeng-\ning work draws you closer and strengthens your relationships.

If the overwhelming majority of people care about having an excellent\ncommunity, they will take care of it, which will yield both better work and better relationships. Relationships have to be genuine,\nnot forced; at the same time, the culture of the community will have a big influence on how people value relationships and how\nthey behave with each other. To me, a meaningful relationship is one in which people care enough about each other to be there\nwhenever someone needs support and they enjoy each other\u2019s company so much that they can have great times together both in-\nside and outside of work. I literally love many of the people I work with, and I respect them deeply.\n\nIhave often been asked whether relationships at Bridgewater are more like those of a family or those of a team, the implication\nbeing that in a family there is unconditional love and a permanent relationship, while in a team the attachment is only as strong\nas the person\u2019s contribution. Before answering this question, I want to emphasize that either is good by me, because both families\nand teams provide meaningful relationships and that neither is anything like a typical job at a typical company, where the rela-\ntionships are primarily utilitarian. But to answer the question directly, I wanted Bridgewater to be like a family business in which\nfamily members have to perform excellently or be cut. If I had a family business and a family member wasn\u2019t performing well, I\n\nwould want to let them go because I believe that it isn\u2019t good for either the family member (because staying in a job they\u2019re not\n\f"}, "001542.png": {"text": "suited to stands in the way of their personal evolution) or the company (because it holds back the whole community). That\u2019s tough\nlove.\n\nTo give you an idea of how Bridgewater\u2019s culture developed and how it\u2019s different from what you'd find at most companies,\n\nI will tell you about how we handled benefits in our early days. When the company was just me and a small group of people, I\ndidn\u2019t provide employees with health insurance; I assumed that they would buy it on their own. But I did want to help the people\nI shared my life with during their times of need. If someone I worked with got seriously sick and couldn\u2019t afford proper care, what\nwas I going to do, stand by and not help them? Of course I'd help them financially, to whatever extent I could. So when I did begin\nproviding health insurance to my employees, I felt that I was insuring myself against the money I knew I'd give them if they were\ninjured or fell ill as much as I was insuring them.\n\nBecause I wanted to make certain that they received the best care possible, the policies I provided allowed them to go to any\ndoctor they chose and spend whatever amount was required. On the other hand, I didn\u2019t protect them against the little things. For\nexample, I didn\u2019t provide dental insurance any more than I provided car insurance, because I felt that it was their own responsi-\nbility to protect their teeth, just as it was their own responsibility to take care of their car. If they needed dental insurance, they\ncould pay for it out of their own pocket. My main point is that I didn\u2019t approach benefits in the impersonal, transactional way most\ncompanies do, but more like something I provided for my family. I was more than generous with some things and expected people\nto take personal responsibility for others.\n\nWhen I treated my employees like extended family, I found that they typically behaved the same way with each other and our\ncommunity as a whole, which was much more special than having a strictly quid pro quo relationship. I can\u2019t tell you how many\npeople would do anything in their power to help our community/company and wouldn\u2019t want to work anywhere else. This is\ninvaluable.\n\nAs Bridgewater grew, my ability to have quality personal contact with everyone faded, but this wasn\u2019t a problem because the\nbroader community embraced this way of being with each other. This didn\u2019t just happen; we did a lot to help it along. For exam-\n\nple, we put into place a policy that we would pay for half of practically any activities that people want to do together up to a set\n\f"}, "001543.png": {"text": "cap (we now support more than a hundred clubs and athletic and common-interest groups); we paid for food and drink for those\nwho hosted potluck dinners at their houses; and we bought a house that employees can use for events and celebrations. We have\nChristmas, Halloween, Fourth of July, and other parties that often include family members. Eventually, others who valued this\nkind of relationship took responsibility for it and it spread to become a cultural norm so that I could just sit back and watch beauty\nhappen.\n\nWhat about the person who doesn\u2019t give a damn about all of this meaningful relationship stuff, who just wants to go into work,\ndo a good job, and receive fair compensation? Is that okay? Sure it is, and it\u2019s common for a significant percentage of employees.\nNot everyone feels the same or is expected to feel the same about the community. It\u2019s totally okay to opt out. We have all sorts of\npeople and respect whatever they want to do on their own time, as long as they abide by the law and are considerate. But these are\nnot the folks who will provide the community with the skeletal strength of commitment that is essential for it to be extraordinary\nover very long periods of time.\n\nNo matter how much one tries to create a culture of meaningful relationships, the organization is bound to have some bad\n(intentionally harmful) people in it.

Are they working just for their paycheck\nor are they looking for something more? Each of us has our own views about what is most important. I\u2019ve made a lot of money\nthrough my work, but I see my job as much more than as a way to make money\u2014it\u2019s how I choose to live out my values around ex-\ncellence, meaningful work, and meaningful relationships. If the people I worked with were primarily interested in making money,\nwe would have conflicts whenever we had to choose between upholding our values and making an easy buck. Don\u2019t get me wrong\n\u2014of course I understand that people don\u2019t work for personal satisfaction alone, and that a job must be economically viable. But we\nall have definite ideas about what we value and what we want our relationships to be like, and employers and employees have to be\nin sync on such things.\n\nNaturally there will be disagreement and negotiation, but some things cannot be compromised and you and your employees\nmust know what those things are. This is especially true if you\u2019re seeking to create an environment that has shared values, a deep\ncommitment to the mission, and high standards of behavior.\n\nAt Bridgewater, we expect people to behave in a manner that is consistent with how people in high-quality, long-term relation-\nships behave\u2014that is, with a high level of mutual consideration for each other\u2019s interests and a clear understanding of who is\nresponsible for what. On the surface, that sounds nice and straightforward, but what exactly does that mean? It is important to be\nclear.\n\nTake for example a case in which an employee\u2019s family member is diagnosed with a severe illness, or an employee dies tragically,\n\nleaving his or her family in a precarious situation. These things happen far more often than any of us would like them to, and there\n\f"}, "001545.png": {"text": "are of course customs and laws that define the basic accommodations and benefits (such as personal vacation days, short- and\nlong-term disability insurance, and life insurance) that are required. But how do you determine what kinds of assistance should\nbe provided beyond that? What are the principles for deciding how to handle each specific situation fairly\u2014which may not always\nmean doing the same thing in every case?\n\nNone of this is easy, but the following principles provide some guidance.\n\na. Make sure people give more consideration to others than they demand for themselves. This is a requirement.\n\nBeing considerate means allowing other people to mostly do what they want, so long as it is consistent with our principles,\npolicies, and the law. It also means being willing to put others ahead of your own desires. If the people on both sides of an argu-\nment approach their disagreements in this way, we will have many fewer disputes about who is offending whom.\n\nStill, judgments will have to be made and lines will have to be drawn and set down in policies.\n\nThis is the overarching guideline: It is more inconsiderate to prevent people from exercising their rights because you are\noffended by them than it is for them to do whatever it is that offends you. That said, it is inconsiderate not to weigh the impact\nof one\u2019s actions on others, so we expect people to use sensible judgment in not doing obviously offensive things. There are some\nbehaviors that are clearly offensive to many people, and it is appropriate to specify and prohibit them in clear policies. The list of\nthose specifics, and the policies pertaining to them, arise from specific cases. Applying this principle to them is done in much the\n\nsame way that case law is created.\n\nb. Make sure that people understand the difference between fairness and generosity. Sometimes people mistake generosity for not being fair. For\nexample, when Bridgewater arranged for a bus to shuttle people who live in New York City to our Connecticut office, one employee\nasked, \u201cIt seems it would be fair to also compensate those of us who spend hundreds of dollars on gas each month, particularly in\n\nlight of the New York City bus.\u201d This line of thinking mistakes an act of generosity for some for an entitlement for everyone.\n\f"}, "001546.png": {"text": "Fairness and generosity are different things. If you bought two birthday gifts for two of your closest friends, and one cost more\nthan the other, what would you say if the friend who got the cheaper gift accused you of being unfair? Probably something like, \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t have to get you any gift, so stop complaining.\u201d At Bridgewater, we are generous with people (and I am personally generous),\nbut we feel no obligation to be measured and equal in our generosity.\n\nGenerosity is good and entitlement is bad, and they can easily be confused, so be crystal clear on which is which. Decisions\nshould be based on what you believe is warranted in a particular circumstance and what will be most appreciated. If you want to\nhave a community of people who have both high-quality, long-term relationships and a high sense of personal responsibility, you\n\ncan\u2019t allow a sense of entitlement to creep in.\n\nc. Know where the line is and be on the far side of fair. The line is what\u2019s fair, appropriate, or required, as distinct from what's generous, in light\nof the defined quid pro quo relationship between parties. As mentioned earlier, you should expect people to behave in a manner\nconsistent with how people in high-quality, long-term relationships behave\u2014with a high level of mutual consideration for each\nother\u2019s interests and a clear understanding of who is responsible for what. Each should operate on the far side of fair, by which 1\nmean giving more consideration to others than you demand for yourself.

If each party says \u201cYou deserve more,\u201d \u201cNo, you deserve more,\u201d rather than \u201cI deserve more,\u201d you are more likely to have\n\ngenerous, good relationships.\n\nd. Pay for work. While it isn\u2019t all about the quid pro quo between the company and the employee, this balance must be economically\nviable for the relationships to be sustainable. Set policies that clearly define this quid pro quo, and be measured, but not excessively\nprecise, when shifting it around. While you should by and large stick to the arrangement, you should also recognize that there are\nrare, special times when employees will need a bit of extra time off and there are times that the company will require employees\n\nto give it extra hours.

When we grew to\nbetween fifty and a hundred people, we had a community; when we grew beyond that, the sense of community began to slip be-\ncause we didn\u2019t all know each other in the same way.

The main difference is that successful people learn from them and unsuccessful people don't. By creat-\ning an environment in which it is okay to safely make mistakes so that people can learn from them, you'll see rapid progress and\nfewer significant mistakes. This is especially true in organizations where creativity and independent thinking are important, as\nsuccess will inevitably require the acceptance of failure as a part of the process. As Thomas Edison once said, \u201cI have not failed. I've\njust found ten thousand ways that do not work.\u201d\n\nMistakes will cause you pain, but you shouldn't try to shield yourself or others from it. Pain is a message that something is\nwrong and it\u2019s an effective teacher that one shouldn\u2019t do that wrong thing again. To deal with your own and others\u2019 weaknesses\nwell you must acknowledge them frankly and openly and work to find ways of preventing them from hurting you in the future. It\u2019s\nat this point that many people say, \u201cNo thanks, this isn\u2019t for me\u2014I'd rather not have to deal with these things.\u201d But this is against\nyour and your organization's best interests\u2014and will keep you from achieving your goals.

The money just sat there in cash and by the time the mistake was discovered it had cost the client (actually Bridge-\nwater, because we had to make good on it) a Jot of money. It was terrible and I could easily have fired Ross to make the point that\nnothing less than perfection will be accepted. But that would have been counterproductive. I would have lost a good man and it\nwould have only encouraged other employees to hide their mistakes, creating a culture that would not only be dishonest but crip-\npled in its ability to learn and grow. If Ross hadn\u2019t experienced that pain, he and Bridgewater would have been the worse for it.\n\nThe point I made by not firing Ross was much more powerful than firing him would have been\u2014I was demonstrating to him\nand others that it was okay to make mistakes and unacceptable not to learn from them. After the dust settled, Ross and I worked\ntogether to build an error log (we now call it the Issue Log), in which traders recorded all their mistakes and bad outcomes so we\ncould track them and address them systematically. It has become one of the most powerful tools we have at Bridgewater. Our en-\nvironment is one in which people understand that remarks such as \u201cYou handled that badly\u201d are meant to be helpful rather than\npunitive.\n\nOf course, in managing others who make mistakes, it is important to know the difference between 1) capable people who made\nmistakes and are self-reflective and open to learning from them, and 2) incapable people, or capable people who aren't able to\nembrace their mistakes and learn from them. Over time I\u2019ve found that hiring self-reflective people like Ross is one of the most im-\nportant things I can do.\n\nFinding this kind of person isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019ve often thought that parents and schools overemphasize the value of having the right\nanswers all the time. It seems to me that the best students in school tend to be the worst at learning from their mistakes, be-\ncause they have been conditioned to associate mistakes with failure instead of opportunity.

Yet\nalignment can never be taken for granted because people are wired so differently. We all see ourselves and the world in our own\nunique ways, so deciding what\u2019s true and what to do about it takes constant work.\n\nAlignment is especially important in an idea meritocracy, so at Bridgewater we try to attain alignment consciously, continually,\nand systematically. We call this process of finding alignment \u201cgetting in sync,\u201d and there are two primary ways it can go wrong:\ncases resulting from simple misunderstandings and those stemming from fundamental disagreements. Getting in sync is the\nprocess of open-mindedly and assertively rectifying both types.\n\nMany people mistakenly believe that papering over differences is the easiest way to keep the peace. They couldn't be more\nwrong. By avoiding conflicts one avoids resolving differences. People who suppress minor conflicts tend to have much bigger\nconflicts later on, which can lead to separation, while people who address their mini-conflicts head on tend to have the best and\nthe longest-lasting relationships.

If they\u2019re not, the process of sorting through\ndisagreements and knowing who has the authority to decide quickly becomes chaotic. Sometimes people get angry or stuck; a con-\nversation can easily wind up with two or more people spinning unproductively and unable to reach agreement on what to do.\n\nFor these reasons, specific processes and procedures must be followed. Every party to the discussion must understand who has\nwhat rights and which procedures should be followed to move toward resolution. (We've also developed tools for helping do this,\nwhich you can review at the end of this book.) And everyone must understand the most fundamental principle for getting in sync,\nwhich is that people must be open-minded and assertive at the same time. Thoughtful disagreement is not a battle; its goal is not\nto convince the other party that he or she is wrong and you are right, but to find out what is true and what to do about it. It must\nalso be nonhierarchical, because in an idea meritocracy communication doesn\u2019t just flow unquestioned from the top down. Criti-\ncisms must also come from the bottom up.\n\nFor example, this email was sent to me by someone who worked for me after a meeting with clients. All the senior people at\n\nBridgewater, including me, are routinely criticized and judged by our subordinates.\n\nFrom: Jim H\nTo: Ray; Lionel K; Greg J; Randal S; David A\n\nSubject: Feedback on ABC Meeting...\n\nRay- you deserve a \u201cD-\u201d for your performance today in the ABC meeting and everyone that was in the room that saw you agrees\non that harsh assessment (give or take half a grade). This was especially disappointing for two reasons: 1) You have been great in\nprevious meetings where the subject matter to be covered was the same, and 2) We held a specific planning meeting yesterday to ask\nyou to focus tightly on culture and portfolio structuring because we had only 2 hours to have you cover those two topics, me cover\n\nthe investment process, have Greg do the observatory and have Randal do implementation. Instead, you took a total of 62 minutes\n\f"}, "001558.png": {"text": "(I measured) but worse, you rambled for 50 minutes on what I think was portfolio structuring topics and only then got to culture\nand you talked about that for 12 minutes. It was obvious to all of us that you did not prepare at all because there is no way you\n\ncould have been that disorganized at the outset if you had prepared.\n\nSimilarly I\u2019d like to share another case in which one of our senior managers observed a conversation between Greg Jensen, who\nwas then CEO, and a junior employee, and felt that Greg was speaking to that employee in a way that discouraged dissent and inde-\npendent thinking. She raised this in feedback she gave Greg. Greg disagreed, asserting that he was simply reminding the employee\nof relevant principles and her responsibilities to either adhere to them or openly question them. The two sought to get in sync\nthrough a series of emails, and when that didn\u2019t work, they raised their disagreement to the Management Committee. A case based\non the meeting in question was sent to the entire company so everyone could judge for themselves who was right and who was\nwrong. It was a good learning exercise that Greg and the senior manager appreciated. We used it to reflect on our written princi-\nples for handling situations like this and they both got a lot of useful feedback. If we hadn\u2019t laid out our principles and used them\nto judge cases like this, we would have people with power making decisions however they wanted instead of in mutually agreed-\nupon ways.\n\nThe principles that follow flesh out how we do this.

If they are not, it will grind to a halt.\n\n4.1 Recognize that conflicts are essential for great relationships . . .\n\n. .. because they are how people determine whether their principles are aligned and resolve their differences.

Spend lavishly on the time and energy you devote to getting in sync, because it's the best investment you can make. In the long run, it saves time by increas-\ning efficiency, but it\u2019s important that you do it well. You will need to prioritize what you are going to get in sync about and who you\nare going to get in sync with because of time constraints. Your highest priority should be the most important issues with the most\n\nbelievable and most relevant parties.\n\n4.2 Know how to get in sync and disagree well.\n\nIt is harder to run an idea meritocracy in which disagreements are encouraged than a top-down autocracy in which they are\nsuppressed. But when believable parties to disagreements are willing to learn from each other, their evolution is faster and their\ndecision making is far better.\n\nThe key is in knowing how to move from disagreement to decision making. It is important that the paths for doing this are clear\nso that who is responsible for doing what is known. (This is the reason I created a tool called the Dispute Resolver, which lays out\nthe paths and makes clear to everyone if they are holding on to a different point of view rather than moving it along to resolution.\nYou can read about it in the tools appendix.)\n\nIt is essential to know where the ultimate decision-making authority lies\u2014i.e., how far the power of the argument will carry\nrelative to the power of the assigned authority. While arguing and especially after a decision is rendered, everyone in the idea mer-\nitocracy must remain calm and respectful of the process.

Surface areas of possible out-of-syncness.

I personally like to do both, though I encour-\nage people to list their disagreements in order of priority so I/we can more easily direct them to the right party at the right time.\nThe nubbiest questions (the ones that there is the greatest disagreement about) are the most important ones to thrash out, as\nthey often concern differences in people\u2019s values or their approaches to important decisions. It\u2019s especially important to bring\n\nthese issues to the surface and examine their premises thoroughly and unemotionally. If you don't, they will fester and cause rot.\n\nb. Distinguish between idle complaints and complaints meant to lead to improvement. Many complaints either fail to take into account the full picture\nor reflect a closed-minded point of view.

Typically they are more in-\nclined to be assertive than open-minded (because it\u2019s easier to convey how they see things than to understand how others do, and\nalso because people tend to have ego attachments to being right) though some people are too willing to accept others\u2019 views at the\n\nexpense of their own.

Distinguish open-minded people from closed-minded people. Open-minded people seek to learn by asking questions; they realize how little\nthey know in relation to what there is to know and recognize that they might be wrong; they are thrilled to be around people who\nknow more than they do because it represents an opportunity to learn something. Closed-minded people always tell you what they\n\nknow, even if they know hardly anything. They are typically uncomfortable being around those who know a lot more than they do.\n\nb.

They\u2019re likely to be more concerned with appearances than actually achieving the\n\ngoal; this can lead to ruin over time.\n\nd.

The person responsible for a decision must be able to ex-\nplain the thinking behind it openly and transparently so that everyone can understand and assess it.

Recognize that getting in sync is a two-way responsibility. In any conversation, there is a responsibility to express and a responsibility to listen.\nMisinterpretations and misunderstandings are always going to happen. Often, difficulty in communication is due to people hav-\n\ning different ways of thinking (e.g., left-brained thinkers talking to right-brained thinkers). The parties involved should always\n\f"}, "001562.png": {"text": "consider the possibility that one or both of them misunderstood and do a back-and-forth so that they can get in sync.

Start by assum-\ning you're either not communicating or listening well instead of blaming the other party. Learn from your miscommunications so\n\nthey don\u2019t happen again.\n\nf. Worry more about substance than style. This is not to say that some styles aren\u2019t more effective than others with different people and in\ndifferent circumstances, but I often hear people complaining about the style or tone of a criticism in order to deflect from its sub-\n\nstance. If you think someone's style is an issue, box it as a separate issue to get in sync on.\n\ng. Be reasonable and expect others to be reasonable. You have a responsibility to be reasonable and considerate when you are advocating for\nyour point of view and should never let your \u201clower-level you\u201d gain control, even if the other person loses his or her temper.

Make it clear who is directing the meeting and whom it is meant to serve. Every meeting should be aimed at achieving someone's goals; that person\nis the one responsible for the meeting and decides what they want to get out of it and how they will do so. Meetings without some-\n\none clearly responsible run a high risk of being directionless and unproductive.\n\nb. Be precise in what you're talking about to avoid confusion. It is often best to repeat a specific question to be sure both questioner and responder\nare crystal clear on what is being asked and answered. In an email, this is often as simple as cutting and pasting the questions into\n\nthe body of the text.\n\nc. Make clear what type of communication you are going to have in light of the objectives and priorities. If your goal is to have people with different opinions\nwork through their differences to try to get closer to what is true and what to do about it (open-minded debate), you will run your\nmeeting differently than if its goal is to educate. Debating takes time, and that time increases exponentially depending on the\nnumber of people participating in the discussion, so you have to carefully choose the right people in the right numbers to suit\n\nthe decision that needs to be made. In any discussion try to limit the participation to those whom you value most in light of your\nobjectives. The worst way to pick people is based on whether their conclusions align with yours. Group-think (people not asserting\n\nindependent views) and solo-think (people being unreceptive to the thoughts of others) are both dangerous.\n\nd. Lead the discussion by being assertive and open-minded. Reconciling different points of view can be difficult and time-consuming.

Both systems produce inferior decision\nmaking. That\u2019s because the best decisions are made by an idea meritocracy with believability-weighted decision making, in which\nthe most capable people work through their disagreements with other capable people who have thought independently about\nwhat is true and what to do about it.\n\nIt is far better to weight the opinions of more capable decision makers more heavily than those of less capable decision makers.\nThis is what we mean by \u201cbelievability weighting.\u201d So how do you determine who is capable at what? The most believable opinions\nare those of people who 1) have repeatedly and successfully accomplished the thing in question, and 2) have demonstrated that\nthey can logically explain the cause-effect relationships behind their conclusions. When believability weighting is done correctly\nand consistently, it is the fairest and the most effective decision-making system. It not only produces the best outcomes but also\npreserves alignment, since even people who disagree with the decision will be able to get behind it.\n\nBut for this to be the case, the criteria for establishing believability must be objective and trusted by everybody. At Bridgewater\neveryone's believability is tracked and measured systematically, using tools such as Baseball Cards and the Dot Collector that ac-\n\ntively record and weigh their experience and track records. In meetings we regularly take votes about various issues via our Dot\n\f"}, "001569.png": {"text": "Collector app, which displays both the equal-weighted average and the believability-weighted results (along with each person\u2019s\nvote).\n\nTypically, if both the equal-weighted average and the believability- weighted votes align, we consider the matter resolved and\nmove on. If the two types of votes are at odds, we try again to resolve them and, if we can\u2019t, we go with the believability-weighted\nvote. Depending on what type of decision it is, in some cases, a single \u201cResponsible Party\u201d (RP) can override a believability-\nweighted vote; in others, the believability-weighted vote supersedes the RP\u2019s decision. But in all cases believability-weighted votes\nare taken seriously when there is disagreement. Even in cases in which the RPs can overrule the believability- weighted vote, the\nonus is on the RP to try to resolve the dispute before overruling it. In my forty years at Bridgewater, I never made a decision con-\ntrary to the believability-weighted decision because I felt that to do so was arrogant and counter to the spirit of the idea meritoc-\nracy, though I argued like hell for what I thought was best.\n\nTo give you an example of what this process looks like in action, during the spring of 2012 our research teams used believability-\nweighted decision making to resolve a disagreement about what would happen next as the European debt crisis was heating up.\nAt that time, the borrowing and debt-service needs of the governments of Italy, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, and especially Spain had\nreached levels that far exceeded their abilities to pay. We knew that the European Central Bank would either have to make unprece-\ndented purchases of government bonds or allow the debt crisis to worsen to the point where defaults and the breakup of the Euro-\nzone would probably occur. Germany was adamantly opposed to a bailout. It was clear that the fates of these countries\u2019 economies,\nand of the Eurozone itself, depended on how well Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, orchestrated the ECB\u2019s\nnext move. But what would he do?\n\nLike analyzing a chess board to visualize the implications and inclinations of the different moves of the different players, each\nof us looked at the situation from every angle. After a lot of discussion we remained split: About half of us thought the ECB would\nprint more money to buy the bonds and about half thought they wouldn't, because breaking with the Germans would threaten the\nEurozone even more. While such thoughtful and open exchanges are essential, it\u2019s also critical to have mutually agreed-upon ways\n\nof resolving them to arrive at the best decision. So we used our believability-weighting system to break the stalemate.\n\f"}, "001570.png": {"text": "We did that using our Dot Collector tool, which helps us surface the sources of our disagreements in people\u2019s different thinking\ncharacteristics and work our way through them based on their believabilities.

By looking at these attributes, and also understanding which thinking\nqualities are most essential to the situation at hand, we can make the best decisions.\n\nIn this case, we took a believability-weighted vote, with the qualities chosen being both subject-matter expertise and ability to\nsynthesize. Using the Dot Collector, it became clear that those with greater believability believed Draghi would defy Germany and\nprint money, so that is what we went with. A few days later, European policymakers announced a sweeping plan to buy unlimited.\nquantities of government bonds, so we got it right. While the believability-weighted answer isn\u2019t always the best answer, we have\nfound that it is more likely to be right than either the boss\u2019s answer or an equal-weighted referendum.\n\nRegardless of whether or not you use this kind of technology and structured process for believability weighting, the most\nimportant thing is that you get the concept. Simply look down on yourself and your team when a decision needs to be made and\n\nconsider who is most likely to be right. I assure you that, if you do, you will make better decisions than if you don't.\n\n5.1 Recognize that having an effective idea meritocracy requires that you\n\nunderstand the merit of each person's ideas.\n\nHaving a hierarchy of merit is not only consistent with an idea meritocracy but essential for it. It\u2019s simply not possible for everyone\nto debate everything all the time and still get their work done. Treating all people equally is more likely to lead away from truth\nthan toward it.

While everyone has\nthe right and obligation to make sense of everything, basic rules for engagement should be followed.

For example, it would not be effective for the person who knows less to\ntell the person who knows more how something should be done.

If you're more believable, your role is more of a teacher, primarily conveying your understanding and\nanswering questions. And if you are approximate peers, you should have a thoughtful exchange as equals. When there is a dis-\nagreement about who is more believable, be reasonable and work it through.

It's more important that the student understand the teacher than that the teacher understand the student, though both are important. I have often seen less be-\nlievable people (students) insist that the more believable people (teachers) understand their thinking and prove why the teacher is\nwrong before listening to what the teacher (the more believable party) has to say. That\u2019s backward. While untangling the student\u2019s\nthinking can be helpful, it is typically difficult and time-consuming and puts the emphasis on what the student sees instead of on\nwhat the teacher wants to convey. For that reason, our protocol is for the student to be open-minded first. Once the student has\ntaken in what the teacher has to offer, both student and teacher will be better prepared to untangle and explore the student\u2019s per-\n\nspective. It is also more time-efficient to get in sync this way, which leads to the next principle.\n\nb.

You also have to provide them witha\nway to get past their disagreements and move forward.\n\nManaging this well is especially important at Bridgewater because we have so much more thoughtful disagreement than other\nplaces. While in most cases people disagreeing can work things out on their own, it is still often the case that people can\u2019t agree\non what's true and what to do about it. In those cases, we follow our procedures for believability-weighted voting and go with the\nverdict; or, in the cases where the RP wants to do it his/her way contrary to the vote and has the power to do so, we accept that and\n\nmove on.\n\f"}, "001581.png": {"text": "In the end, people who join our idea meritocracy agree to abide by our policies and procedures and the decisions that come out\nof them, just as if they had taken a dispute to court and had to abide by its procedures and the resulting verdict. This requires them\nto separate themselves from their own opinion and avoid getting angry when a decision doesn\u2019t go their way. If people don\u2019t follow\nthe agreed-upon paths, they don\u2019t have the right to complain about either the people they disagree with or the idea-meritocratic\nsystem itself.\n\nIn those rare cases where our principles, policies, and procedures fail to make clear how a disagreement should be resolved, it is\n\neveryone's responsibility to raise that fact so the process can be clarified and improved.\n\n6.1 Remember: Principles can't be ignored by mutual agreement.\n\nPrinciples are like laws\u2014you can't break one simply because you and someone else agree to break it. Remember that it\u2019s everyone\u2019s\nobligation to speak up, own it, or get out. If you don\u2019t think the principles provide the right way to resolve a problem or disagree-\n\nment, you need to fight to change the principles, not just do what you want to do.\n\na. The same standards of behavior apply to everyone. Whenever there is a dispute, both parties are required to have equal levels of integrity, to\nbe open-minded and assertive, and to be equally considerate. The judges must hold the parties to the same standards and provide\nfeedback consistent with these standards. I have often seen cases in which the feedback wasn\u2019t appropriately balanced for various\nreasons (to hold the stronger performer to a higher standard, to spread the blame). This is a mistake. The person in the wrong\nneeds to receive the strongest message. Not operating this way could lead them to believe that the problem wasn\u2019t caused by them,\nor was caused by both parties equally. Of course, the message should be conveyed calmly and clearly rather than emotionally to\n\nmaximize its effectiveness.\n\f"}, "001582.png": {"text": "6.2 Make sure people don't confuse the right to complain, give advice, and\n\nopenly debate with the right to make decisions.\n\nEveryone does not report to everyone.

If you can do this well, you will see the situation as \u201can-\nother one of those,\u201d see it through everyone's eyes, and have good mental maps or principles for deciding how to handle it.\n\nAlmost all people initially find it difficult to get beyond seeing things through just their own eyes, so I\u2019ve developed policies and\ntools such as the Coach (which connects situations to principles) that help people do this. With practice many people can learn to\ndevelop this perspective, though others never do. You need to know which type of person you and the people around you are. If you\ncan\u2019t do this well on your own, seek the help of others.

It starts with interviewers picking people they like and who are like them instead\nof focusing on what people are really like and how well they will fit in their jobs and careers.

At the very beginning, we just hired people we liked. But too many of them turned out to be bad fits. Because we\nliked them, we were reluctant to give up on them, and things often went from bad to worse. So we started hiring like most compa-\nnies do, by looking at r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, narrowing the lists, and then interviewing to get a gut feel for who was right. But the questions we\nasked our candidates, unlike the questions on a scientifically constructed personality test, were unlikely to elicit answers truly in-\ndicative of what they were like.\n\nWhat we were doing, essentially, was looking at prospective employees through our own biased perspectives. Those of us who\nwere linear thinkers tended to want to hire linear thinkers; those of us who were lateral thinkers tended to want to hire lateral\nthinkers. We all thought the type we chose would perform best in all jobs, and as a result we weren't able to accurately predict who\nwould succeed and who would fail in our very unusual environment. As a result, we continued to make a lot of bad hires.\n\nEventually we learned from our mistakes and failures that we could improve our hiring results in two ways: 1) by always being\ncrisp and clear on exactly what kind of person we were looking for, and 2) by developing our vocabulary for and means of evalu-\n\nating people's abilities at a much more granular level.

Because we\ntreat work as more than just what we do to make a living, we look at every potential hire not just as an employee but as someone\nwe'd want share our lives with. We insist that the people we work with are considerate and have a high sense of personal account-\nability to do the difficult, right things. We look for people with generous natures and high standards of fairness. Most important,\nthey must be able to put their egos aside and assess themselves candidly.\n\nWhether you choose to look for these same traits or others, the most important thing you can do is understand that hiring is a\nhigh-risk gamble that needs to be approached deliberately. A lot of time, effort, and resources go into hiring and developing new\nemployees before it\u2019s clear whether or not they are good fits. Months or even years and countless dollars can be wasted in training\nand retraining. Some of those costs are intangible, including loss of morale and a gradual diminishment of standards as people\nwho aren't excellent in their roles bump into each other; other costs from bad outcomes can be measured all too easily in dollars\nand cents.

Some focus more on the particulars; still others think creatively or logically or with\nsupreme organization. Skills are learned tools, such as being able to speak a foreign language or write computer code.

It is highly desirable to understand\none\u2019s own and others\u2019 ways of thinking and their best applications. Some qualities are more suitable for some jobs. For example,\nyou might not want to hire a highly introverted person as a salesman. That\u2019s not to say an introvert can\u2019t do that job; it\u2019s just that a\n\ngregarious person is likely to be more satisfied in the role and do a better job.\n\f"}, "001600.png": {"text": "If you're not naturally good at one type of thinking, it doesn\u2019t mean you're precluded from paths that require it.

Personality assessments are valuable tools for getting a quick picture of what\n\npeople are like in terms of their abilities, preferences, and style. They are often more objective and reliable than interviews.\n\nb. Remember that people tend to pick people like themselves, so choose interviewers who can identify what you are looking for.

Recognize that performance in school doesn't tell you much about whether a person has the values and abilities you are looking for. Largely because they are the\neasiest to measure, memory and processing speed tend to be the abilities that determine success in school, so school performance\nis an excellent gauge of these qualities. School performance is also a good gauge of a person\u2019s determination to succeed, as well as\ntheir willingness and ability to follow directions.

The person who is capable but doesn\u2019t have good character is generally destructive,\nbecause he or she has the cleverness to do you harm and will certainly erode the culture.

This data is essential in cases where a manager and a report are out of sync on an as-\nsessment and others are called in to resolve the dispute.\n\nA few years ago, one of our employees was serving in a trial role as a department head. The prior department head had left the\nfirm, and Greg, who was then CEO, was assessing whether this employee, who had previously been a deputy, had the right abilities\nto step into the role. The employee thought he did; Greg and others thought he did not. But this decision was not as simple as the\nCEO \u201cmaking the call.\u201d We want decisions to be more evidence-based. As a result of our Dot Collector system of constant feedback,\nwe had literally hundreds of data points on the specific attributes required for the job, including synthesis, knowing what he didn\u2019t\nknow, and managing at the right level. So we put all this data onto the screen and stared hard at it together. We then asked the\nemployee to look at that body of evidence and reflect on what he would do if he were in the position of deciding whether he\u2019d hire\nhimself for the job.

Improvements in\nabilities are more difficult but essential to expanding what a person can be responsible for over time. And changing someone\u2019s\nvalues is something you should never count on. In every relationship, there comes a point when you must decide whether you are\nmeant for each other\u2014that\u2019s common in private life and at any organization that holds high standards. At Bridgewater, we know\nthat we cannot compromise on the fundamentals of our culture, so if a person can\u2019t get to the bar in an acceptable time frame, he\nor she must leave.\n\nEvery leader must decide between 1) getting rid of liked but incapable people to achieve their goals and 2) keeping the nice but\nincapable people and not achieving their goals. Whether or not you can make these hard decisions is the strongest determinant of\nyour own success or failure. In a culture like Bridgewater's, you have no choice.

While it\u2019s generally as difficult for managers to give this feedback as it is for their sub-\n\nordinates to hear it, in the long run it makes people happier and the organization more successful.\n\na. Recognize that personal evolution should be relatively rapid and a natural consequence of discovering one\u2019s strengths and weaknesses; as a result, career paths are\n\nnot planned at the outset. The evolutionary process is about discovering people\u2019s likes and dislikes as well as their strengths and weak-\nnesses; it occurs when people are put into jobs they are likely to succeed at, but in which they have to stretch themselves. Each per-\nson\u2019s career will evolve based on what we all learn about what the person is like.\n\nThey should be given enough freedom to learn and think for themselves while being coached so they are prevented from mak-\ning unacceptable mistakes. The feedback they receive should help them reflect on whether their problems are the kind that can\nbe resolved by additional learning or stem from natural abilities that are unlikely to change. Typically it takes from six to twelve\nmonths to get to know a new employee in a by-and-large sort of way, and about eighteen months for them to internalize and\nadapt to the culture. During this time there should be periodic mini-reviews and several major ones. Following each of these as-\nsessments, new assignments should be made that are tailored to their likes and dislikes and strengths and weaknesses.

People who excel at book learning\ntend to call up from memory what they have learned in order to follow stored instructions.

Think about accuracy, not implications. It\u2019s often the case that someone receiving critical feedback gets preoccupied with the implications\nof that feedback instead of whether it\u2019s true.

Don't oversqueeze a dot. Remember: A dot is just a dot; what matters is how they add up. Think of each individual dot as an at-bat in\nbaseball. Even great hitters are going to strike out many times, and it would be foolish to evaluate them based on one trip to the\nplate. That\u2019s why stats like on-base percentage and batting average exist.\n\nIn other words, any one event has many different possible explanations, whereas a pattern of behavior can tell you a lot about\nroot causes. The number of observations needed to detect a pattern largely depends on how well you get in sync after each obser-\n\nvation. A quality discussion of how and why a person behaved a certain way should help you understand the larger picture.\n\nd. Use evaluation tools such as performance surveys, metrics, and formal reviews to document all aspects of a person's performance.It\u2019s hard to have an objective,\nopen-minded, emotion-free conversation about performance if there is no data to discuss. It\u2019s also hard to track progress. This is\npart of the reason I created the Dot Collector. I also recommend thinking about other ways that people\u2019s responsibilities can be put\nin metrics. One example: You can have people note whether they did or didn\u2019t do things on checklists, which you can then use to\ncalculate what percentage of tasks they complete. Metrics tell us whether things are going according to plan\u2014they are an objective\n\nmeans of assessment and they improve people\u2019s productivity.\n\n9.6 Make the process of learning what someone is like open, evolutionary, and iterative.\n\nArticulate your assessment of a person\u2019s values, abilities, and skills up front and share it; listen to their and others\u2019 responses to\nyour description; organize a plan for training and testing; and reassess your conclusions based on the performance you observe.\nDo this on an ongoing basis. After several months of discussions and real-world tests, you and your report should both have a\npretty good idea of what he or she is like. Over time this exercise will crystallize suitable roles and appropriate training or it will re-\n\nveal that it\u2019s time for the person to find a more appropriate job somewhere else.\n\f"}, "001616.png": {"text": "a. Make your metrics clear and impartial. To help you build your perpetual motion machine, have a clear set of rules and a clear set of metrics\nto track how people are performing against those rules\u2014and predetermined consequences that are determined formulaically\nbased on the output of those metrics.\n\nThe more clear-cut the rules are, the less arguing there will be about whether someone did something wrong. For example, we\nhave rules about how employees can manage their own investments in a way that doesn\u2019t conflict with how we manage money for\nclients. Because these rules are clear-cut, there\u2019s no room for argument when a breach occurs.\n\nHaving metrics that allow everyone to see everyone else\u2019s track record will make evaluation more objective and fair. People\nwill do the things that will get them higher grades and will argue less about them. Of course, since most people have a number\nof things to do that are of different importance, different metrics have to be used and weighted appropriately. The more data you\ncollect, the more immediate and precise the feedback will be. That is one of the reasons I created the Dot Collector tool to work as it\ndoes (providing lots of immediate feedback); people often use the feedback that they get during a meeting to course-correct in the\nmeeting in real time.\n\nOnce you have your metrics, you can tie them to an algorithm that spits out consequences. They can be as simple as saying that\nfor every time you do X you will earn Y amount of money (or bonus points), or it can be more complex (for example, tying the\nweighted mix of metrics grades to various algorithms that provide the estimated compensation or bonus points).\n\nWhile this process will never be exact, it will still be good in even its crudest form, and over time it will evolve to be terrific. Even\nwhen flawed, the formulaic output can be used with discretion to provide a more precise evaluation and compensation; over time\n\nit will evolve into a wonderful machine that will do much of your managing better than you could do it on your own.\n\nb. Encourage people to be objectively reflective about their performance. Being able to see yourself from a higher level is essential for personal evo-\nlution and achieving your goals. So you and the people who report to you should be looking at the evidence of their performance\ntogether; for this to go well, you need lots and lots of evidence and an objective point of view. If required, use agreed-upon others to\n\ntriangulate the picture the evidence presents.\n\f"}, "001617.png": {"text": "c. Look at the whole picture. In reviewing someone, the goal is to see the patterns and to understand the whole picture. No one can be\nsuccessful in every way (if they are extremely meticulous, for example, they might not be able to be fast, and vice versa). Assess-\n\nments made in reviews must be concrete; they\u2019re not about what people should be like but what they are like.\n\nd. For performance reviews, start from specific cases, look for patterns, and get in sync with the person being reviewed by looking at the evidence together. While\nfeedback should be constant, reviews are typically periodic; their purpose is to bring together the accumulated evidence of what a\nperson is like as it pertains to their job performance. If the constant feedback is done well, it will become like a constant review as\nthe bits and pieces will add up to the whole. A review should contain few surprises, because you should continuously be striving to\nmake sense of how the person is doing their job. If you think their job is being done badly, you should have been probing to identify\nand address the root causes of their underperformance on a case-by-case basis. It\u2019s difficult for people to identify their own weak-\nnesses; they need the appropriate probing (not nit-picking) of specific cases by others to get at the truth of what they are like and\nhow they are fitting into their jobs.\n\nIn some cases it won\u2019t take long to see what a person is like; in other cases it\u2019s a lot harder. But over time and with a large enough\nsample of cases, their track records (the level and the steepness up or down in the trajectories that they are responsible for, rather\nthan the occasional wiggles) should paint a clear picture of what you can expect from them. If there are performance issues, it is\neither because of design problems (perhaps the person has too many responsibilities) or fit/abilities problems. If the problems are\ndue to the person\u2019s inabilities, these inabilities are either because of the person\u2019s innate weaknesses in doing that job (e.g., someone\nwho's five foot two probably shouldn\u2019t be a center on the basketball team) or because of inadequate training. A good review, and\ngetting in sync throughout the year, should get at these things. Make sure to make your assessment relative to the absolute bar, not\njust the progress over time. What matters most is not just outcomes but how responsibilities were handled. The goal of a review is\nto be clear about what the person can and can\u2019t be trusted to do based on what they are like. From there, you can determine what to\n\ndo about it.\n\f"}, "001618.png": {"text": "e, Remember that when it comes to assessing people, the two biggest mistakes you can make are being overconfident in your assessment and failing to get in sync on it.\nIf you believe that something is true about someone, it\u2019s your responsibility to make sure that it is true and that the person you're\nassessing agrees. Of course, in some cases it may be impossible to get in sync (if you believe that someone was dishonest and they\ninsist that they weren't, for example), but in a culture of truth and transparency it is an obligation to share your view and let oth-\n\ners express theirs.\n\nf. Get in sync on assessments in a nonhierarchical way. In most organizations, evaluations run in only one direction, with the manager assess-\ning the managee. The managee typically disagrees with the assessment, especially if it is worse than his or her self-assessment,\nbecause most people believe themselves to be better than they really are. Managees also have opinions about managers that they\nwouldn't dare bring up in most companies, so misunderstandings and resentments fester. This perverse behavior undermines the\neffectiveness of the environment and the relationships between people. It can be avoided by getting in sync in a high-quality way.\nYour reports have to believe that you're not their enemy\u2014that your sole goal is to move toward the truth; that you are trying to\nhelp them and so will not enable their self-deception, perpetuate a lie, or let them off the hook. This has to be done in an honest\nand transparent way, because if someone believes they are being pigeonholed unfairly the process won't work. As equal partners, it\n\nis up to both of you to get to the truth. When each party is an equal participant, no one can feel cornered.\n\ng. Learn about your people and have them learn about you through frank conversations about mistakes and their root causes. You need to be clear in conveying\nyour assessments to your reports and open-minded in listening to their replies so you can work on setting their training and career\npaths together. Recognizing and communicating people\u2019s weaknesses is one of the most difficult things managers have to do. It\u2019s\nimportant for the party receiving feedback to be sympathetic to the person trying to give it, because it\u2019s not easy\u2014it takes charac-\n\nter on the part of both participants to get to the truth.\n\f"}, "001619.png": {"text": "h.

Help people through the pain that comes with exploring their weaknesses. Emotions tend to heat up during most disagreements, especially when\nthe subject is someone\u2019s weaknesses.

Whenever you identify a problem\nwith your machine, you need to diagnose whether it is the result of a flaw in its design or in the way your people are handling their\nresponsibilities.\n\nSample size is important. Any problem can be a one-off imperfection or a symptom of root causes that will show up as problems\n\nrepeatedly. If you look at enough problems, which one it is will become clear.\n\f"}, "001634.png": {"text": "b. Understand that a great manager is essentially an organizational engineer. Great managers are not philosophers, entertainers, doers, or artists.\nThey are engineers. They see their organizations as machines and work assiduously to maintain and improve them. They create\nprocess-flow diagrams to show how the machine works and to evaluate its design. They build metrics to light up how well each of\nthe individual parts of the machine (most importantly, the people) and the machine as a whole are working. And they tinker con-\nstantly with its designs and its people to make both better.\n\nThey don\u2019t do this randomly. They do it systematically, always keeping the cause-and-effect relationships in mind. And while\nthey care deeply about the people involved, they cannot allow their feelings for them or their desire to spare them discomfort to\nstand in the way of the machine\u2019s constant improvement. To do otherwise wouldn't be good for either the individuals on the team.\nor the team that the individuals are a part of.\n\nOf course, the higher up you are in an organization, the more important vision and creativity become, but you still must have\nthe skills required to manage/orchestrate well. Some young entrepreneurs start with the vision and creativity and then develop\ntheir management skills as they scale their companies; others start with management skills and develop vision as they climb the\nladder. But like great musicians, all great managers have both creativity and technical skills. And no manager at any level can ex-\n\npect to succeed without the skill set of an organizational engineer.\n\nc. Build great metrics. Metrics show how the machine is working by providing numbers and setting off alert lights in a dashboard.\nMetrics are an objective means of assessment and they tend to have a favorable impact on productivity. If your metrics are good\nenough, you can gain such a complete and accurate view of what your people are doing and how well they are doing it that you can\nalmost manage via the metrics alone.\n\nIn constructing your metrics, imagine the most important questions you need answered in order to know how things are going\nand imagine what numbers will give you the answers to them. Don\u2019t look at the numbers that you have and try to adapt them to\nyour purposes, because you won't get what you need. Instead start with the most important questions and imagine the metrics\n\nthat will answer them.\n\f"}, "001635.png": {"text": "Remember that any single metric can mislead; you need enough evidence to establish patterns. And of course the information\nthat goes into the metrics must be assessed for accuracy. A reluctance to be critical can be detected by looking at the average grade\neach grader gives; those giving higher average grades might be easy graders and vice versa. Similarly helpful are \u201cforced rankings,\u201d\nin which people must rank co-worker performance from best to worst. Forced rankings are essentially the same thing as \u201cgrading\n\nonacurve.\u201d Metrics that allow for independent grading across departments and groups are especially valuable.\n\nd.

No matter how complete any project or plan, there will always be things that come out of nowhere\nand look like the most important or urgent or attractive thing to focus on. These shiny objects may be traps that will distract you\n\nfrom thinking in a machinelike way, so be on your guard for them and don\u2019t let yourself be seduced.\n\n10.2 Remember that for every case you deal with, your approach should have two purposes. . .\n\n\u00ab+. 1) to move you closer to your goal, and 2) to train and test your machine (i.e., your people and your design). The second purpose is more important than\nthe first because it is how you build a solid organization that works well in all cases. Most people focus more on the first purpose,\n\nwhich is a big mistake.\n\na. Everything is a case study. Think about what type of case it is and what principles apply to that type of case. By doing this and helping\n\nothers to do this you'll get better at handling situations as they repeat over and over again through time.\n\f"}, "001636.png": {"text": "b. When a problem occurs, conduct the discussion at two levels: 1) the machine level (why that outcome was produced) and 2) the case-at-hand level (what to do about\n\nit). Don\u2019t make the mistake of just having the case-at-hand discussion, because then you are micromanaging (ie., you are doing\nyour managee\u2019s thinking and your managee will mistakenly think that\u2019s okay). When having the machine-level discussion, think\nclearly how things should have gone and explore why they didn\u2019t go that way. If you are in a rush to determine what to do and you\n\nhave to tell the person who works for you what to do, make sure to explain what you are doing and why.\n\nc. When making rules, explain the principles behind them. You don\u2019t want the people you work with to merely pay lip service to your commu-\nnity\u2019s rules; they should have a high sense of ethics that makes them want to abide by them and hold others accountable for abid-\ning by them, while also working to perfect them. The way to achieve this is via principles that are sound and that have been tested\n\nthrough open discussion.\n\nd. Your policies should be natural extensions of your principles. Principles are hierarchical\u2014some are overarching and some are less important\u2014\nbut they all should inform the policies that guide your individual decisions. It pays to think those policies through to ensure that\nthey are consistent with each other and the principles they are derived from.\n\nWhen faced with a case that doesn\u2019t have a clear policy to follow (for example, what to do about an employee whose job is to.\ntravel but who faces potential health risks because of his travel), one can\u2019t just snatch an answer out of the blue without regard for\nhigher-level principles. Policymakers must make policy in the same way that the judicial system creates case law\u2014iteratively and\nincrementally, by dealing with specific cases and interpreting the law as it applies to them.\n\nThat is how I have tried to operate. When a case arises, I lay out the principles behind how I am handling it and get in sync with\nothers to see if we agree on those principles or must modify them to make them better.

While good principles and policies almost always provide good guidance, remember that there are exceptions to every rule.

Changes in policies must be approved by those who made\nthem (or someone else who has been made responsible for evolving them).\n\nWhen someone wishes to make an exception to an important policy at Bridgewater, they must write up a proposed alternative\npolicy and escalate their request to the Management Committee.\n\nExceptions should be extremely rare because policies that have frequent exceptions are ineffective. The Management Commit-\n\ntee will formally consider it and either reject it, amend it, or adopt it.\n\n10.3 Understand the differences between managing, micromanaging, and not managing.\n\nGreat managers orchestrate rather than do. Like the conductor of an orchestra, they do not play an instrument, but direct their\npeople so that they play beautifully together. Micromanaging, in contrast, is telling the people who work for you exactly what tasks\nto do or doing their tasks for them. Not managing is having them do their jobs without your oversight and involvement. To be suc-\n\ncessful, you need to understand these differences and manage at the right level.\n\na. Managers must make sure that what they are responsible for works well. They can do this by 1) managing others well (as explained above), 2)\njob slipping down to do work they\u2019re not responsible for because others can\u2019t do their jobs well, or 3) escalating what they can\u2019t\nmanage well. The first choice is optimal; the second signals that a change is needed in the people and the design; the third choice is\n\nharder still but mandatory.\n\f"}, "001638.png": {"text": "b. Managing the people who report to you should feel like skiing together. Like a ski instructor, you need to have close contact with your people on\nthe slopes so that you can assess their strengths and weaknesses as they are doing their jobs. There should be a good back-and-\n\nforth as they learn by trial and error. With time you will be able to decide what they can and can\u2019t handle on their own.\n\nc. An excellent skier is probably going to be a better ski coach than a novice skier. Believability applies to management too. The better your track\n\nrecord, the more value you can add as a coach.\n\nd. You should be able to delegate the details. If you keep getting bogged down in details, you either have a problem with managing or train-\ning, or you have the wrong people doing the job. The real sign of a master manager is that he doesn\u2019t have to do practically any-\nthing. Managers should view the need to get involved in the nitty-gritty as a bad sign.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s danger in thinking you're delegating details when you're actually being too distant from what's im-\nportant and essentially are not managing. Great managers know the difference. They strive to hire, train, and oversee in a way in\n\nwhich others can superbly handle as much as possible on their own.\n\n10.4 Know what your people are like and what makes them tick, because your\n\npeople are your most important resource.\n\nDevelop a full profile of each person\u2019s values, abilities, and skills. These qualities are the real drivers of behavior, so knowing them\nin detail will tell you which jobs a person can and cannot do well, which ones they should avoid, and how the person should be\ntrained. These profiles should change as the people change.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know your people well, you don\u2019t know what you can expect from them.

No manager should delegate responsibilities to people they don\u2019t know well.\nIt takes time to learn about people and how much confidence you can vest in them. Sometimes new people are offended when their\nmanagers don\u2019t have confidence in how they are carrying out their responsibilities. They think it\u2019s a criticism of their abilities\nwhen it\u2019s simply a matter of the manager being realistic about the fact that he or she hasn't had enough time or direct experience\n\nwith them to form a point of view.\n\nc. Vary your involvement based on your confidence. Management largely consists of scanning and probing everything you are responsible for\nto identify suspicious signs. Based on what you see, you should vary your degree of digging, doing more for people and areas that\nlook suspicious, and less where what you see instills confidence. At Bridgewater a host of tools (Issue Logs, metrics, daily updates,\n\nchecklists) produce objective performance-related data. Managers should review and spot-check them regularly.\n\n10.5 Clearly assign responsibilities.\n\nEliminate any confusion about expectations and ensure that people view their failures to complete their tasks and achieve their\ngoals as personal failures. The most important person on a team is the one who is given the overall responsibility for accomplish-\ning the mission.

While that might sound obvious, people often fail to stick to their own responsibilities. Even\nsenior people in organizations sometimes act like young kids just learning to play soccer, running after the ball in an effort to help\nbut forgetting what position they are supposed to play. This can undermine rather than improve performance. So make sure that\n\npeople remember how the team is supposed to work and play their positions well.\n\nb. Watch out for \u201cjob slip.\u201d Job slip is when a job changes without being explicitly thought through and agreed to, generally because of\nchanging circumstances or a temporary necessity. Job slip often leads to the wrong people handling the wrong responsibilities and\n\nconfusion over who is supposed to do what.\n\n10.6 Probe deep and hard to learn what you can expect from your machine.\n\nConstantly probe the people who report to you while making sure they understand that it\u2019s good for them and everyone else to\nsurface their problems and mistakes. Doing so is required to make sure you're getting what you want, even from people who are\ndoing their jobs well (though they can be given a bit more leeway).\n\nProbing shouldn't just come from the top down.

You need to know your people extremely well, provide and receive regular feedback, and have quality dis-\ncussions.

If it doesn\u2019t, you run the risk of not managing. The tools I have\n\ndeveloped give me windows into what people are doing and what they are like, and I follow up on problems.\n\nc. Use daily updates as a tool for staying on top of what your people are doing and thinking. I ask each person who reports to me to take about ten to fif-\nteen minutes to write a brief description of what they did that day, the issues pertaining to them, and their reflections. By reading\nthese updates and triangulating them (i.e., seeing other people\u2019s takes on what they are doing together), I can gauge how they are\n\nworking together, what their moods are, and which threads I should pull on.\n\nd. Probe so you know whether problems are likely to occur before they actually do. If problems take you by surprise, it is probably because you are\neither too far removed from your people and processes or you haven't adequately visualized how the people and processes might\n\nlead to various outcomes. When a crisis is brewing, contact should be close enough that there will be no surprises.\n\ne. Probe to the level below the people who report to you.

If you are an\nemployee, and you get a paycheck for turning up and pleasing your boss, your mind-set will inevitably be trained to this cause-\neffect relationship. If you are a manager, make sure you structure incentives and penalties that encourage people to take full own-\nership of what they do and not just coast by. This includes straightforward things such as spending money like it\u2019s their own and\nmaking sure their responsibilities aren\u2019t neglected when they\u2019re out of the office.

Think for yourself which principles are best for handling similar cases. This will help solve not only this problem but other\n\nproblems like it.\n\nd. Avoid Monday morning quarterbacking. Evaluate the merits of a past decision based not on what you know now but only on what you\ncould have reasonably known at the time the decision was made. Every decision has pros and cons; you can\u2019t evaluate choices in\nretrospect without the appropriate context. Do this by asking yourself, \u201cWhat should a quality person have known and done in\nthat situation?\u201d Also, have a deep understanding of the person who made the decision (how they think, the type of person they are,\n\nwhether they learned from the situation, and so on).\n\ne. Don't confuse the quality of someone's circumstances with the quality of their approach to dealing with the circumstances. One can be good and the other can\nbe bad, and it\u2019s easy to confuse which is which.

Identifying the fact that someone else doesn\u2019t know what to do doesn\u2019t mean that you know what to do.

Drill-downs are not diagnoses, but a form of broad and deep probing.\nThey\u2019re not intended to uncover the causes of every problem: only the 20 or so percent of causes that produce 80 percent of the\nsuboptimal effects. A drill-down takes place in two steps and is then followed by design and execution steps. If done well, the two\n\ndrill-down steps can be done in about four hours.

Your focus in this step is strictly on listing the problems.\n\nStep 2: Identify the Root Causes. For each problem, identify the deep-seated reason behind the actions that caused each problem. Most\nproblems happen for one of two reasons: 1) It isn\u2019t clear who the Responsible Party is, or 2) The Responsible Party isn\u2019t handling\nhis/her responsibilities well.\n\nYou must distinguish proximate causes from root causes. Proximate causes are the reasons or actions that led to the problem.\nWhen you start describing the qualities behind these reasons or actions, you are getting closer to the root cause.\n\nTo get at the root cause, keep asking \u201cWhy?\u201d For example:\n\nProblem:\n\nThe team is continually working late and is on the verge of burning out.\n\nWhy?\n\f"}, "001671.png": {"text": "Because we don\u2019t have enough capacity to meet the demand put on the team.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause we inherited this new responsibility without additional staff.\n\nWhy?\nBecause the manager did not understand the volume of work before accepting the responsibility.\nWhy?\n\nBecause the manager is bad at anticipating problems and creating plans. [Root Cause]\n\nDo not exclude any relevant people from the drill-down: Besides losing the benefit of their ideas, you'll disenfranchise them\nfrom the game plan and reduce their sense of ownership. At the same time, remember that people tend to be more defensive than\nself-critical. It is your job as a manager to get at truth and excellence, not to make people happy. For example, the correct path\nmight be to fire some people and replace them with better people, or put them in jobs they might not want. Everyone\u2019s objective\nmust be to get at the best answers, not the answers that will make the most people happy.\n\nYou may find that multiple problems identified in Step 1 share the same root cause. Because you are doing a drill-down ina\nquick session, your root cause diagnoses may only be provisional\u2014essentially alerts about things to watch out for.\n\nWhen Step 2 is completed, take a break to reflect; then come up with a plan.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan. Step away from the group and develop a plan that addresses the root causes. Plans are like movie scripts, where\nyou visualize who will do what through time to achieve the goals.

Designs need to be based on deep and accurate understandings (which is why diagnosis is so important); for me, it\u2019s\nan almost visceral process of staring at problems and using the pain they cause me to stimulate my creative thinking.\n\nThis is exactly how it was for the team responsible for client service analytics\u2014and especially for Bridgewater\u2019s co-CEO David\nMcCormick, who was then head of the Client Service Department. Coming out of the diagnosis, he moved quickly to design and\nimplement changes. He fired the team members who had allowed standards to slip and reflected deeply on what new designs he\ncould implement to get the right people into the right roles. In selecting his new Responsible Parties for client service analytics, he\npicked one of our top investment thinkers who also had extremely high standards (and was very outspoken about cases where he\nsaw them slipping) and paired him with one of our most experienced managers, who knew how to build the right process flows\nand make sure everything that needed to happen would go precisely as planned.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t all. When coming up with a design, it\u2019s important to take time to reflect and make sure you're looking at the\n\nproblems from the highest level. David knew it would be a mistake to look only at this one part of the department, because the\n\f"}, "001674.png": {"text": "same slip in quality that had happened there was likely to have occurred in other places too. He needed to think creatively to come\nup with a design that would build a durable culture of pervasive excellence throughout the entire department. This led to his in-\nvention of \u201cQuality Day,\u201d biannual meetings in which members of the Client Service Department would review each other\u2019s mock\npresentations and memos and give direct feedback on what was good and what wasn\u2019t. More importantly, the meetings were a\nchance to step back and assess whether the ways of ensuring quality were working as expected\u2014by bringing in a bunch of tough,\nindependent thinkers to offer criticism and get the process realigned on what good looks like.\n\nOf course, there were many more details to all of David\u2019s plans for transforming the department. But the important thing is how\nall the details and plans extended from a high-level visualization of what was required. Only when you have such a sketch can you\nbegin to fill it in with specifics. Those specifics will be your tasks; write them down so you don\u2019t forget them.\n\nWhile the best designs are drawn from a rich understanding of actual problems, when you're just starting out on something,\nyou often have to design based on anticipated problems as opposed to actual ones. That\u2019s why having systematic ways of tracking\nissues (the Issue Log) and what people are like (the Dot Collector) is so useful: Instead of just relying on your best guesses of what\nmight go wrong, you can look at data from prior \u201cat bats\u201d for yourself and others and come to the design process with understand-\ning rather than having to start from scratch.\n\nThe most talented designers I know are people who can visualize over time, running through different collections of people\nfrom the scale of small teams to entire organizations, accurately anticipating the kinds of results they\u2019ll produce. They excel at\ndesign and systemization. Hence the overriding principle of this chapter: Design and systemize your machine. Creativity is also\nimportant to this process, as is character, because the most important problems to design around are often the hardest, and you\nneed to come up with original ways of addressing them and be willing to make hard choices (especially when it comes to people\nand who should do what).\n\nThe following principles delve into designing and how to do it well.\n\f"}, "001675.png": {"text": "13.1 Build your machine.\n\nFocus on each task or case at hand and you will be stuck dealing with them one by one. Instead, build a machine by observing what\nyou're doing and why, extrapolating the relevant principles from the cases at hand, and systemizing that process. It typically takes\nabout twice as long to build a machine as it does to resolve the task at hand, but it pays off many times over because the learning\n\nand efficiency compound into the future.\n\n13.2 Systemize your principles and how they will be implemented.\n\nIf you have good principles that guide you from your values to your day-to-day decisions but you don\u2019t have a systematic way of\nmaking sure they\u2019re regularly applied, they\u2019re not of much use. It\u2019s essential to build your most important principles into habits\n\nand help others do so as well. Bridgewater's tools and culture are designed to do just that.\n\na. Create great decision-making machines by thinking through the criteria you are using to make decisions while you are making them. Whenever I make an invest-\nment decision, I observe myself making it and think about the criteria I used. I ask myself how I would handle another one of those\nsituations and write down my principles for doing so. Then I turn them into algorithms. I am now doing the same for manage-\nment and I have gotten in the habit of doing it for all my decisions.\n\nAlgorithms are principles in action on a continuous basis. I believe that systemized, evidence-based decision making will radi-\ncally improve the quality of management. Human managers process information spontaneously using poorly thought-out criteria\n\nand are unproductively affected by their emotional biases. These all lead to suboptimal decisions. Imagine what it would be like to\n\f"}, "001676.png": {"text": "have a machine that processes high-quality data using high-quality decision-making principles/criteria. Like the GPS in your car, it\nwould be invaluable, whether you follow all of its suggestions or not. I believe that such tools will be essential in the future, and as\n\nI write these words, I am a short time away from getting a prototype online.\n\n13.3 Remember that a good plan should resemble a movie script.\n\nThe more vividly you can visualize how the scenario you create will play out, the more likely it is to happen as you plan. Visualize\nwho will do what when and the result they\u2019ll produce. This is your mental map of your machine. Recognize that some people are\nbetter or worse at visualization. Accurately assess your own abilities and those of others so you can use the most capable people to\n\ncreate your plans.\n\na. Put yourself in the position of pain for a while so that you gain a richer understanding of what you're designing for. Either literally or vicariously (through\nreading reports, job descriptions, etc.), temporarily insert yourself into the workflow of the area you're looking at to gain a better\nunderstanding of what it is that you are dealing with. As you design, you'll be able to apply what you've learned, and revise the ma-\n\nchine appropriately as a result.\n\nb. Visualize alternative machines and their outcomes, and then choose. A good designer is able to visualize the machine and its outcomes in various\niterations. First they imagine how Harry, Larry, and Sally can operate in various ways with various tools and different incentives\nand penalties; then they replace Harry with George, and so on, thinking through what the products and people and finances would\n\nlook like month by month (or quarter by quarter) under each scenario. Then they choose.\n\nc. Consider second- and third-order consequences, not just first-order ones. The outcome you get as a first-order consequence might be desirable,\n\nwhile the second- or third-order consequences could be the opposite. So focusing solely on first-order consequences, which people\n\f"}, "001677.png": {"text": "tend to do, can lead to bad decision making. For example, if you asked me if I\u2019d like to not have rainy days, I probably would say yes\n\nif I didn\u2019t consider the second- and third-order consequences.\n\nd. Use standing meetings to help your organization run like a Swiss clock. Regularly scheduled meetings add to overall efficiency by ensuring that\nimportant interactions and to-do\u2019s aren\u2019t overlooked, eliminating the need for inefficient coordination, and improving operations\n(because repetition leads to refinement). It pays to have standardized meeting agendas that ask the same feedback questions in\neach meeting (such as how effective the meeting was) and nonstandard meeting agendas that include things done infrequently\n\n(such as quarterly budget reviews).\n\ne. Remember that a good machine takes into account the fact that people are imperfect. Design in such a way that you produce good results even when\n\npeople make mistakes.\n\n13.4 Recognize that design is an iterative process. Between a bad \u201cnow\u201d and\n\na good \u201cthen\u201d is a \u201cworking through it\u201d period.\n\nThat \u201cworking through it\u201d period is when you try out different processes and people, seeing what goes well or poorly, learning\nfrom the iterations, and moving toward the ideal systematic design. Even with a good future design picture in mind, it will natu-\nrally take some mistakes and learning to get to a good \u201cthen\u201d state.\n\nPeople frequently complain about this kind of iterative process because it tends to be true that people are happier with nothing\nat all than with something imperfect, even though it would be more logical to have the imperfect thing. That kind of thinking\n\ndoesn\u2019t make sense, so don\u2019t let it distract you.\n\f"}, "001678.png": {"text": "a. Understand the power of the \u201ccleansing storm.\u201d In nature, cleansing storms are big infrequent events that clear out all the overgrowth that\u2019s\naccumulated during good times. Forests need these storms to be healthy\u2014without them, there would be more weak trees and a\nbuildup of overgrowth that stifles other growth. The same is true for companies. Bad times that force cutbacks so only the strong-\nest and most essential employees (or companies) survive are inevitable and can be great, even though they seem terrible at the\n\ntime.\n\n13.5 Build the organization around goals rather than tasks.\n\nGiving each department a clear focus and the appropriate resources to achieve its goals makes the diagnosis of resource allocations\nmore straightforward and reduces job slip. As an example of how this works, at Bridgewater we have a Marketing Department\n(goal: to market) that is separate from our Client Service Department (goal: to service clients), even though they do similar things\nand there would be advantages to having them work together. But marketing and servicing clients are two distinct goals; if they\nwere merged, the department head, salespeople, client advisors, analysts, and others would be giving and receiving conflicting\nfeedback. If asked why clients were receiving relatively poor attention, the answer might be: \u201cWe have incentives to raise sales.\u201d If\n\nasked why they weren't making sales, the merged department might explain that they need to take care of their clients.\n\na. Build your organization from the top down. An organization is the opposite of a building: Its foundation is at the top, so make sure you hire\nmanagers before you hire their reports. Managers can help design the machine and choose the people who complement it. People\noverseeing departments need to be able to think strategically as well as run the day-to-day.

Remember that everyone must be overseen by a believable person who has high standards. Without strong oversight, there is potential for inadequate\n\nquality control, inadequate training, and inadequate appreciation of excellent work. Never just trust people to do their jobs well.\n\nc. Make sure the people at the top of each pyramid have the skills and focus to manage their direct reports and a deep understanding of their jobs. A few years ago,\nsomeone at Bridgewater proposed that our facilities group (the people who take care of the building and grounds, food service,\noffice supplies, etc.) should begin to report to our head of technology because of the overlap in the two areas (computers are a\nfacility too, they use electricity, and so on). But having the people who are responsible for janitorial services and meals report to\n\na technology manager would be as inappropriate as having technology people report to the person taking care of facilities. These\nfunctions, even if they\u2019re considered \u201cfacilities\u201d in the broadest sense, are very different, as are the respective skill sets. Similarly,\nat another time, we talked about putting the folks who work on client agreements under the same manager as those who do coun-\nterparty agreements. But that would have been a mistake because the skills required to reach agreements with clients are very\ndifferent from the skills required to reach agreements with counterparties. It would be wrong to conflate both departments under\n\nthe general heading of \u201cagreements,\u201d because each calls for specific knowledge and skills.\n\nd. In designing your organization, remember that the 5-Step Process is the path to success and that different people are good at different steps. Assign specific peo-\nple to do each of these steps based on their natural inclinations.\n\nFor example, the big-picture visionary should be responsible for goal setting, the taste tester should be assigned the job of\nidentifying and not tolerating problems, the logical detective who doesn\u2019t mind probing people should be the diagnoser, the\nimaginative designer should craft the plan to make the improvements, and the reliable taskmaster should make sure the plan gets\nexecuted. Of course, some people can do more than one of these things\u2014generally people do two or three well. Virtually nobody\ncan do them all well. A team should consist of people with all of these abilities and they should know who is responsible for which\n\nsteps.\n\f"}, "001680.png": {"text": "e. Don't build the organization to fit the people. Managers will often take the people who work in their organization as a given and try to make\nthe organization work well with them. That\u2019s backward. Instead, they should imagine the best organization and then make sure\nthe right people are chosen for it. Jobs should be created based on the work that needs to be done, not what people want to do or\nwhich people are available. You can always search outside to find the people who click best for a particular role. First come up with\nthe best workflow design, then sketch it out on an organizational chart, visualize how the parts interact, and specify what qualities\n\nare required for each job. Only after all that is done should you choose the people to fill the slots.\n\nf. Keep scale in mind. Your goals must be the right size to warrant the resources that you allocate to them. An organization might not\nbe big enough to justify having both a sales and an analytics group, for example. Bridgewater successfully evolved from a one-cell\norganization, in which most people were involved in everything, to a multi-cellular organization because we retained our ability to\nfocus efficiently as we grew.\n\nTemporarily sharing or rotating resources is fine and is not the same as a merging of responsibilities. On the other hand, the\nefficiency of an organization decreases as the number of people and/or its complexity increases, so keep things as simple as pos-\nsible.

Organize departments and sub-departments around the most logical groupings based on \u201cgravitational pull.\u201d Some groups naturally gravitate toward one\nanother. That gravitational pull might be based on common goals, shared abilities and skills, workflow, physical location, and so\n\nforth. Imposing your own structure without acknowledging these magnetic pulls will likely result in inefficiency.\n\nh. Make departments as self-sufficient as possible so that they have control over the resources they need to achieve their goals.

The number of layers from top to bottom and the ratio of managers to\n\ntheir direct reports will limit the size of an effective organization.\n\nj. Consider succession and training in your design. This is a subject I wish I had thought about much earlier in my career. To ensure that your\norganization continues to deliver results, you need to build a perpetual motion machine that can work well without you.

Don't just pay attention to your job; pay attention to how your job will be done if you are no longer around. I wrote about key-man risk earlier, which applies\nthe most to those with the largest areas of responsibility, especially the head of an organization. If that\u2019s you, then you should\ndesignate the people who could replace you and have them do your job for a while so they can be vetted and tested. These results\nshould be documented in a manual that the appropriate people can go to if you should be hit by a bus. If all the key people in the\norganization do this, you will have a strong \u201cfarm team,\u201d or at least a clear understanding of vulnerabilities and a plan to deal with\nthem. Remember that a ninja manager is somebody who can sit back and watch beauty happen\u2014i.e., an orchestrator. If you are\nalways trying to hire somebody who is as good as or better than you at your job, that will both free you up to go on to other things\n\nand build your succession pipeline.\n\f"}, "001682.png": {"text": "Beyond that, visualizing your replacement is an enlightening and productive experience. In addition to taking stock of what you\nare doing and coming up with both bad and good names, you will start to think about how to get your best people into slots that\ndon\u2019t yet exist.

Use \u201cdouble-do\u201d rather than \u201cdouble-check\u201d to make sure mission-critical tasks are done correctly. Double-checking has a much higher rate of errors\nthan double-doing, which is having two different people do the same task so that they produce two independent answers. This not\nonly ensures better answers but will allow you to see the differences in people\u2019s performance and abilities. I use double-do\u2019s in crit-\nical areas such as finance, where large amounts of money are at risk.\n\nAnd because an audit is only as effective as the auditor is knowledgeable, remember that a good double-check can only be done\nby someone capable of double-doing. If the person double-checking the work isn\u2019t capable of doing the work himself, how could he\n\npossibly evaluate it accurately?\n\nm.

If a position is part-time and requires highly specialized knowledge, I would\nprefer to have it done by consultants or outsiders.\n\nAt the same time, you need to beware of the chronic use of consultants to do work that should be done by employees. This will\ncost you in the long run and erode your culture. Also make sure you are careful not to ask consultants to do things that they don\u2019t\nnormally do. They will almost certainly revert to doing things in their usual way; their own employers will demand that.\n\nWhen evaluating whether to use a consultant, consider the following factors:\n\f"}, "001683.png": {"text": "1. Quality Control. When someone doing work for you is an employee, you are responsible for the quality of their work. But\nwhen the person working for you works for another company, you're operating by their standards, so it\u2019s important to\nknow whether their standards are as high or higher than yours.\n\n2. Economics. If a full-time person is required, it is almost certainly more cost-effective to create a position. Consultants\u2019 daily\nrates add up to considerably more than the annualized cost of a full-time person.\n\n3. Institutionalization of Knowledge. Someone who is around your environment on an ongoing basis will gain knowledge\nand an appreciation of your culture that no outsider can.\n\n4. Security. Having outsiders do the job substantially increases your security risks, especially if you can\u2019t see them at work\n\n(and monitor whether they follow proper precautions, like not leaving sensitive documents on their desks).\n\nYou have to consider whether you should be outsourcing or developing capabilities in-house. Though temps and consultants\n\nare good for a quick fix, they won\u2019t augment your capacities in the long term.\n\n13.6 Create an organizational chart to look like a pyramid, with straight lines down that don't cross.\n\nThe whole organization should look like a series of descending pyramids, but the number of layers should be limited to minimize\n\nhierarchy.\n\na. Involve the person who is the point of the pyramid when encountering cross-departmental or cross-sub-departmental issues. Imagine an organizational chart\nas a pyramid that consists of numerous pyramids.\nWhen issues involve parties not in the same part of the pyramid, it is generally desirable to involve the person who is at the point\n\nof the pyramid, and thus has the perspective and knowledge to weigh the trade-offs and make informed decisions.\n\f"}, "001684.png": {"text": "b. Don't do work for people in another department or grab people from another department to do work for you unless you speak to the person responsible for overseeing the\n\nother department.

Watch out for \u201cdepartment slip.\u201d This happens when a support department mistakes its responsibility to provide support with a man-\ndate to determine how the thing they are supporting should be done. An example of this sort of mistake would be if the facilities\ngroup thought it should determine what facilities we should have. While support departments should know the goals of the peo-\n\nple they\u2019re supporting and provide feedback regarding possible choices, they are not the ones to determine the vision.\n\f"}, "001685.png": {"text": "13.7 Create guardrails when needed\u2014and remember it's better not to guardrail at all.\n\nEven when you find people who are great clicks for your design, there will be times when you'll want to build guardrails around\nthem. No one is perfect, everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and as hard as you look, you won't always be able to find every-\nthing you want in one person. So look down on your machine and the people you choose for your roles, and think about where you\nmight need to supplement your design by adding people or processes to ensure that each job is done excellently.\n\nRemember, guardrailing is meant to help people who can by and large do their jobs well\u2014it\u2019s intended to help good people per-\nform better, not to help failing people reach the bar. If you're trying to guardrail someone who is missing the core abilities required\nfor their job, you should probably just fire them and look for someone else who will be a better click.\n\nA good guardrail typically takes the form of a team member whose strengths compensate for the weaknesses of the team\nmember who needs to be guardrailed. A good guardrailing relationship should be firm without being overly rigid. Ideally, it should\nwork like two people dancing\u2014they\u2019re literally pushing against each other, but with a lot of mutual give-and-take. Of course, hav-\ning someone in a job who needs to be guardrailed is not as good as having someone in a job who will naturally do the right things.\n\nStrive for that.\n\na. Don't expect people to recognize and compensate for their own blind spots. I constantly see people form wrong opinions and make bad decisions,\neven though they\u2019ve made the same kinds of mistakes before\u2014and even though they know that doing so is illogical and harmful.\nI used to think that they would avoid these pitfalls when they became aware of their blind spots, but typically that\u2019s not the case.\nOnly very rarely do I hear someone recuse himself from offering an opinion because they aren\u2019t capable of forming a good one ina\nparticular area. Don\u2019t bet on people to save themselves; proactively guardrail them or, better yet, put them in roles in which it\u2019s im-\n\npossible for them to make the types of decisions they shouldn\u2019t make.\n\f"}, "001686.png": {"text": "b.

In situations where you're unable to identify one excellent Responsible Party for a role (which is always\nbest), find two or three believable people who care deeply about producing excellent results and are willing to argue with each\nother and escalate their disagreements if necessary. Then set up a design in which they check and balance each other.

That can happen for organizations in much the\nsame way as it happens for families and communities. To help nurture that, it is desirable to reinforce the traditions and reasons\n\nfor them, as well as to make sure the values and strategic goals are imbued in the successive leaders and the population as a whole.\n\na. Don't put the expedient ahead of the strategic.

Think about both the big picture and the granular details, and understand the connections between them. Avoid fixating on irrelevant details. You have to\ndetermine what\u2019s important and what\u2019s unimportant at each level. For example, imagine you are designing a house. First you need\nto start with the big picture: Your house will sit on a plot of land, and you have to think through where the water comes from, how\nthe house gets hooked up to the power grid, and so on. Then you need to decide how many rooms it will have, where the doors will\ngo, where you need windows, and so on. When designing the plan, you need to think about all of these things and connect them,\nbut that doesn\u2019t mean that you actually need to go out and pick the hinges for the door yourself. You just need to know that you'll\n\nneed a door with hinges and how it fits into the bigger picture of the house.\n\n13.9 Have good controls so that you are not exposed to the dishonesty of others.\n\nDon\u2019t assume that people are operating in your interest rather than their own. A higher percentage of the population than you\nmight imagine will cheat if given the opportunity. When offered the choice of being fair with you or taking more for themselves,\nmost people will take more for themselves. Even a tiny amount of cheating is intolerable, so your happiness and success will de-\n\npend on your controls. I have repeatedly learned this lesson the hard way.\n\na. Investigate and let people know you are going to investigate. Investigate and explain to people that you are going to investigate so there are no\nsurprises. Security controls should not be taken personally by the people being checked, just like a teller shouldn\u2019t view the bank\ncounting the money in the drawer (rather than just accepting the teller\u2019s count) as an indication that the bank thinks the teller is\ndishonest. Explain that concept to employees so that they understand it.\n\nBut even the best controls will never be foolproof. For that reason (among many others), trustworthiness is a quality that should\n\nbe appreciated.\n\f"}, "001688.png": {"text": "b. Remember that there is no sense in having laws unless you have policemen (auditors). The people doing the auditing should report to people outside\nthe department being audited, and auditing procedures should not be made known to those being audited. (This is one of our few\n\nexceptions to radical transparency.)\n\nc. Beware of rubber-stamping. When a persons role involves reviewing or auditing a high volume of transactions or things that other\npeople are doing, there\u2019s a real risk of rubber-stamping. One particularly risky example is expense approvals. Make sure you have\n\nways to audit the auditors.\n\nd. Recognize that people who make purchases on your behalf probably will not spend your money wisely. This is because 1) it is not their money and 2) it is\ndifficult to know what the right price should be. For example, if somebody proposes a price of $125,000 for a consulting project, it\nis unpleasant, difficult, and confusing to figure out what the market rate is and then negotiate a better price. But the same person\nwho's reluctant to negotiate with the consultant will bargain furiously when he is hiring someone to paint his own house. You\nneed to have proper controls, or better yet, a part of the organization that specializes in this kind of thing. There\u2019s retail and there\u2019s\n\nwholesale.

When situations require dual reporting, managers need to be informed.

For example, though HR people help with hiring, firing, and providing benefits, it would be a mis-\n\ntake to give them the responsibility of determining who gets hired and fired and what benefits are provided to employees.\n\nb. Constantly think about how to produce leverage. Leverage in an organization is not unlike leverage in the markets; you're looking for ways to\nachieve more with less. At Bridgewater, I typically work at about 50:1 leverage, meaning that for every hour I spend with each per-\nson who works for me, they spend about fifty hours working to move the project along. At our sessions, we go over the vision and\nthe deliverables, then they work on them, and then we review the work, and they move forward based on my feedback\u2014and we do\nthat over and over again. The people who work for me typically have similar relationships with those who work for them, though\ntheir ratios are typically between 10:1 and 20:1. I am always eager to find people who can do things nearly as well as (and ideally\nbetter than) I can so that I can maximize my output per hour.\n\nTechnology is another great tool for providing leverage. To make training as easy to leverage as possible, document the most\ncommon questions and answers through audio, video, or written guidelines, and then assign someone to organize them and incor-\nporate them into a manual, which is updated on a regular basis.\n\nPrinciples themselves are a form of leverage\u2014they\u2019re a way to compound your understanding of situations so that you don\u2019t\n\nneed to exert the same effort each time you encounter a problem.\n\f"}, "001690.png": {"text": "c.

Leveragers are people who can go from conceptual to practical effectively and do the most to get your concepts im-\nplemented. Conceptualizing and managing takes only about 10 percent of the time needed for implementing, so if you have good\n\nleveragers, you can devote a lot more of your time to what\u2019s most important to you.\n\n13.11 Remember that almost everything will take more time and cost more money than you expect.\n\nVirtually nothing goes according to plan because one doesn\u2019t plan for the things that go wrong. I personally assume things will\ntake about one and a half times as long and cost about one and a half times as much because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve typically experienced.\n\nHow well you and the people working with you manage will determine your expectations.\n\f"}, "001691.png": {"text": " \n\f"}, "001692.png": {"text": "14 Do What You Set Out to Do\n\nThe organization, like the individual, has to push through to results in order to succeed\u2014this is step five in the 5-Step Process.\n\nWhile recently cleaning up a huge pile of work products from the 1980s and 1990s, I came across boxes and boxes full of\nresearch. There were thousands of pages, most covered with my scribbles, and I realized that they represented just a fraction of the\neffort I'd put in. At our fortieth-year celebration I was given copies of the almost ten thousand Bridgewater Daily Observations that\nwe'd published. Every one of them expressed our deepest thinking and research about markets and economies. I also stumbled.\nacross the manuscript of an eight-hundred-page book that I wrote but then got too busy to publish, and countless other memos\nand letters to clients, research reports, and versions of the book you're reading now. Why did I do all these things? Why do others\nwork so hard to achieve their goals?\n\nFrom what I can see, we do it for different reasons. For me, the main reason is that I can visualize the results of pushing through\nso intensely that I experience the thrill of success even while I\u2019m still struggling to achieve it. Similarly, I can visualize the tragic re-\nsults of not pushing through. I am also motivated by a sense of responsibility; I have a hard time letting people I care about down.\nBut that\u2019s just what\u2019s true for me.

While there might be more glamour in coming up with\nthe brilliant new ideas, most of success comes from doing the mundane and often distasteful stuff, like identifying and dealing\nwith problems and pushing hard over a long time. This was certainly the case with the Client Service Department. Through a lot\nof relentless hard work in the years since the original problem turned up, the department has become an example to other teams\nat Bridgewater\u2014and our client satisfaction levels remain consistently high. The great irony of all this is that none of our clients\never even noticed the problems we saw with the memos.

Rather than be above\nthe principles, the people responsible for running the organization must be evaluated, chosen, and\u2014if needed\u2014replaced in an\nevidence-based way according to rules, just like everyone else in the organization.

To produce real behavioral change, understand that there must be internalized or habituated learning. Thankfully, technology has made internalized\nlearning much easier today than it was when books were the primary way of conveying knowledge. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the book\nwas a powerful invention. Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s printing press allowed easy dissemination of knowledge that helped people build\non each other\u2019s learnings.

Use tools to collect data and process it into conclusions and actions. Imagine that virtually everything important going on in your company can\nbe captured as data, and that you can build algorithms to instruct the computer, as you would instruct a person, to analyze that\ndata and use it in the way you agreed it should be used.

It is the process that checks and balances power to assure that the principles\nand interests of the community as a whole are always placed above the interests and power of any individual or faction. Because\npower will rule, power must be put in the hands of capable people in key roles who have the right values, do their jobs well, and will\ncheck and balance the power of others.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize the importance of this sort of governance until after I transitioned out of the CEO role, because I was an entre-\npreneur and company builder (as well as an investment manager) who largely did what I thought was best. While I needed and\ndeveloped double-checks on myself\u2014I created a Management Committee that I put above me so that I had to report to it\u2014I always\nhad the power of my equity to change things, though I never used it. Some might say that I was a benevolent despot because while\nThad all the power (the complete voting rights), I exercised my power in an idea-meritocratic way, recognizing that the good of the\nwhole was best for us all, and that I needed to be double-checked. I certainly did not create the sort of governance system appropri-\nate for Bridgewater, given its scale.\n\nFor example, Bridgewater didn\u2019t have a board of directors overseeing the CEOs, there were no internal regulations, no judicial\n\nsystem for people to appeal to, and no enforcement system, because we didn\u2019t need them. I, with the help of others, simply created\n\f"}, "001702.png": {"text": "the rules and enforced them, though everyone had the right to appeal and overturn my and others\u2019 judgments. Our principles\nwere the equivalent of what the Articles of Confederation had been to the United States in its first years, and our policies were like\nour laws, but I never created a formal way of operating such as a \u201cConstitution\u201d or a justice system to enforce them and resolve\ndisputes. As a result, when I stepped out and passed the power to others, confusions about decision rights arose. After conferring\nwith some of the world\u2019s greatest experts on governance, we put a new system in place based on these principles. Still, I want to\nmake clear that I don\u2019t consider myself an expert on governance and can\u2019t vouch for the following principles as much as I can\n\nvouch for the previous ones, because they are still new as of this writing.\n\n16.1 To be successful, all organizations must have checks and balances.\n\nBy checks, I mean people who check on other people to make sure they\u2019re performing well, and by balances, I mean balances of\npower. Even the most benevolent leaders are prone to becoming more autocratic, if for no other reason than because managing a\nlot of people and having limited time to do it requires them to make numerous difficult choices quickly, and they sometimes lose\npatience with arguments and issue commands instead. And most leaders are not so benevolent that they can be trusted to put the\n\norganization\u2019s interests ahead of their own.\n\na. Even in an idea meritocracy, merit cannot be the only determining factor in assigning responsibility and authority. Appropriate vested interests also need to\nbe taken into consideration. For example, the owners of a company might have vested interests that they are perfectly entitled to\nthat might be at odds with the vested interests of the people in the company who, based on the idea meritocracy, are most believ-\nable. That should not lead the owners to simply turn over the keys to those leaders. That conflict has to be worked out. Since the\n\npurpose of the idea meritocracy is to produce the best results, and the owners have the rights and powers to assess that, of course\n\nthey will make the determination\u2014though I recommend they choose wisely.\n\f"}, "001703.png": {"text": "b. Make sure that no one is more powerful than the system or so important that they are irreplaceable. For an idea meritocracy, it is especially important\nthat its governance system is more powerful than any individual\u2014and that it directs and constrains its leaders rather than the\nother way around. The Chinese leader Wang Qishan drew my attention to what happened in ancient Rome when Julius Caesar\nrevolted against the government, defeated his fellow general Pompey, seized control of the Republic from the Senate, and named\nhimself emperor for life. Even after he was assassinated and governance by the Senate was restored, Rome would never again be\n\nwhat it was; the era of civil strife that followed was more damaging than any foreign war.\n\nc.

Because this approach can work equally well in most organizations, I wanted to lay it out clearly and in detail. While you\nneedn't follow this idea-meritocratic approach exactly as I\u2019ve done it, the big question is: Do you want to work in an idea meritoc-\nracy? If so, what is the best way for you to do that?\n\nAn idea meritocracy requires people to do three things: 1) Put their honest thoughts on the table for everyone to see, 2) Have\nthoughtful disagreements where there are quality back-and-forths in which people evolve their thinking to come up with the best\ncollective answers possible, and 3) Abide by idea-meritocratic ways of getting past the remaining disagreements (such as believ-\nability-weighted decision making). While an idea meritocracy doesn\u2019t have to operate exactly in any particular way, it does have to\nby and large follow those three steps.

It surfaces people's thinking, analyzes it, and uses the infor-\n\nmation to help people make real-time decisions better in a few ways. Specifically:\n\n+ Participants continuously record their assessments of each other by giving them \u201cdots,\u201d positive or negative, on any number\nof several dozen attributes. These dots are laid out in a grid that updates dynamically, so that everyone in the conversation\ncan see one another\u2019s thinking as the meeting progresses. Doing this helps people shift their perspectives from being stuck\nin their own heads with their own opinions to looking down on everyone's views. Seeing things through everyone's eyes\nnaturally causes most people to adopt the higher-level view in which they recognize that their own perspective is just one of\nmany, so they ask themselves which criteria are best for deciding how to resolve the issue at hand. In this way it promotes\nopen-minded, idea-meritocratic, collective decision making.\n\n+ It helps people make better decisions by providing advice in the same way a GPS does. By taking data on what everyone in the\nroom is like, the app is able to give people individualized coaching, which is especially important when their own opinions\nare unlikely to be right. We have found that helping people through such times can be invaluable.\n\n+ The Dot Collector highlights what we call \u201cnubby questions\u201d\u2014cases where the pattern of answers and attributes of people\non different sides of an issue suggest that there\u2019s an important disagreement to be resolved. For example, it will alert you\nautomatically if you disagree with the believability- weighted majority on a given issue and give you guidance on the appro-\npriate steps to take to resolve that disagreement in an evidence-based way.\n\n+ It enables believability-weighted voting. The Dot Collector provides both a polling interface where people can vote yes or no\n(or provide a numerical rating) and a back-end system of believability weighting, which allows us to look at vote results on\nboth equal-weighted and believability-weighted bases, not as just simple majorities but also based on which way the people\nwhose views have the most merit voted. While this may sound complicated, it\u2019s simply a way of helping people keep track of\n\nbelievability without having to remember who is more believable at what.\n\f"}, "001715.png": {"text": "BASEBALL CARDs\n\nIn addition to collecting \u201cdots\u201d about people in meetings, we collect data on our people in numerous other ways (reviews, tests, the\nchoices people make, etc.). All these dots are analyzed via computerized algorithms based on stress-tested logic in order to create\npointillist pictures of what people are like. That logic is typically shared with and vetted by the people in the company to help its\nobjectivity and believability. We then capture these pictures in Baseball Cards, which are a simple way of presenting a person\u2019s\nstrengths and weaknesses and the evidence behind them (in much the same way as a baseball card does for a professional baseball\nplayer).\n\nI found that we needed to have these and refer to them regularly because without them, people tended to interact with each\nother without any regard to who was good or bad at what. For example, Baseball Cards are useful in meetings, where they allow\npeople to assess the qualities of whoever is expressing a point of view to determine the merit of that opinion. As a supplement\nto Baseball Cards, we developed another tool called the People Profile, which takes all the data from Baseball Cards (which have\ngrown complex over time) to provide a simple, text-based summary of what each person is like. Over time, this is meant to provide\nemployees with a systemized synthesis that captures Bridgewater\u2019s best thinking about what someone is like. We work with the\npeople being assessed to compare these pictures with the assessed person's own perceptions. In this way of seeking alignment be-\ntween the process and the person\u2019s self-perception, both the processes and the confidences in the perceptions are improved.\n\nIn order to match people to jobs, I developed the Combinator, which takes the data from the Baseball Cards and allows one to\nlook at people based on their key attributes and compare them to one another. If you're looking for a certain type of person to filla\nrole, you can enter a few names of people who fit the image, and the Combinator will call up the precise data on what those people\nare like, synthesize the key qualities that make them that way, and then search the database to help you find other similar people.\nThe Combinator can also be used to generate job specifications (based on the type of person you are looking for) that you can apply\n\nboth inside and outside the company.\n\f"}, "001716.png": {"text": "ISSUE LOG\n\nThe Issue Log is our primary tool for recording our mistakes and learning from them. We use it to bring all problems to the sur-\nface, so we can put them in the hands of problem solvers to make systematic improvements. It acts like a water filter that catches\ngarbage. Anything that goes wrong must be \u201cissue logged\u201d with the severity of the issue and who is responsible for it specified, so\nthat it\u2019s easy to sort through most problems. Issue logs also provide paths for diagnosing problems and the information pertaining\nto them. In that way, they also provide effective metrics of performance, as they allow you to measure the numbers and types of\nproblems coming up (and identify the people who are contributing to them and fixing them).\n\nThe Issue Log is a good example of a tool that changed habits and perceptions. A common challenge people had at first was\nopenly pointing out mistakes, because some people instinctively viewed pointing out mistakes as hurtful to the people who made\nthem. Once they got used to doing this, they realized the benefit of it and they got in the good habit of doing it. Now most people\n\ncan\u2019t do without it.\n\nPAIN BUTTON\n\nI believe Pain+Reflection=Progress. In other words, pain is an important signal that there is something to be learned, and if you re-\nflect on your pain well, you will almost always learn something important. That prompted me to create the Pain Button.\n\nThe moment someone experiences pain is the best time for them to record what the pain is like, but it\u2019s a bad time to reflect be-\ncause it\u2019s hard to keep a clear head. So the app is designed to let people record the emotions they are feeling (anger, disappointment,\nfrustration, etc.) as they feel them and then come back at a later time to reflect on them using guided reflection questions. The tool\n\nprompts the people who experienced the pain to specify what they will do to deal with that situation, so that the pain is mitigated\n\f"}, "001717.png": {"text": "in the future (for example, have a quality conversation with the person who is causing the pain, etc.).

The tool creates a\ntemplate for looping toward improvement that everyone can see. It allows you to share your entries with others or keep them to\nyourself. Some people have described the Pain Button as like having a psychologist in your pocket, although better as it\u2019s always\n\navailable and a hell of a lot cheaper.\n\nDISPUTE RESOLVER\n\nDisputes need clear paths toward resolution. That is especially so in an idea meritocracy where people are expected to disagree\nand create paths for resolving disagreements. The Dispute Resolver provides paths for resolving disagreements in an idea-merito-\ncratic way. It asks a series of questions used to guide the people through the resolution process. One of its features is that it locates\nbelievable people who can help determine whether a disagreement is worth taking up at a higher management level. The app also\nmakes clear to everyone that if they have a different point of view from others, it\u2019s up to them to express it and work to get in sync\n\u2014instead of privately holding on to the view and not putting it on the table.

Because these encounters were most im-\nportantly shaped with Bob Prince, Greg Jensen, Giselle Wagner, Dan Bernstein, David McCormick, Eileen Murray, Joe Dobrich, Paul\nColman, Rob Fried, Ross Waller, Claude Amadeo, Randal Sandler, Osman Nalbantoglu, Brian Kreiter, Tom Sinchak, Tom Waller, Ja-\nnine Racanelli, Fran Shanne, and Lisa Safian, they are the people to whom I am most grateful.\n\nBob, Greg, and I have spent the greater parts of our adult lives trying to discover the timeless and universal laws of economies\nand markets. In the process, we had daily interactions that were typically thoughtful, infrequently bloody, and occasionally eu-\nphoric. While our meetings were primarily about economies and markets and led to the discovery of invaluable economic and\ninvestment principles, they also taught us a great amount about ourselves and about how people should be with each other. We\ncaptured these lessons as life and work principles that were even more valuable. More recently, we did that with Eileen Murray and\nDave McCormick, who together replaced me as co-CEOs. Thank you, Dave and Eileen, for contributing to, receiving, and taking care\nof the boon.\n\nWhen I first imagined transitioning Bridgewater from a first-generation organization to a second-generation one, I decided to\npull together my scattered collection of principles into this recipe book to help others at Bridgewater. Collecting and transform-\ning what started as a messy pile of principles into this beautiful book was an epic effort that Mark Kirby, more than anyone, was\n\nresponsible for helping me with. I also appreciate Arthur Goldwag\u2019s and Mike Kubin\u2019s contributions in tightening up and refining\n\f"}, "001722.png": {"text": "the entire manuscript. (Mike did that as a friend.) I further appreciate Arianna Huffington, Tony Robbins, Norm Rosenthal, and\nKristina Nikolova for taking the time to read the book and provide valuable suggestions.\n\nThose who enabled me most on a daily basis were \u201cRay\u2019s Angels\u201d (Marilyn Caufield, Petra Koegel, Kristy Merola, and Christina\nDrossakis), \u201cRay\u2019s Leveragers\u201d (Zack Wieder, Dave Alpert, Jen Gonyo, and Andrew Sternlight\u2014and past leveragers Elise Waxenberg,\nDavid Manners-Weber, and John Woody), and \u201cRay\u2019s Researchers\u201d (Steven Kryger, Gardner Davis, and Brandon Rowley\u2014and past\nresearcher Mark Dinner).

Though my interests and directions have always been diverse, these teams made my missions their missions, and kept\nme moving forward. Without their help, I wouldn\u2019t have accomplished anything close to what I have. Thank you for enduring me\nand for selflessly supporting me.\n\nWhatever beauty you see in the book\u2019s design was the result of Phil Caravaggio\u2019s generosity and talent. After I put the original\nversion of Principles online as a PDF, he came to me as a stranger bearing the gift of a gorgeously designed print edition, created\nwith the help of the artistic book designer Rodrigo Corral. Phil, who is a brilliant entrepreneur in his own right, just wanted to\nthank me because the principles had helped him. The book's beauty astounded me, and Phil\u2019s account of what these principles\nmeant to him was another gift that nudged me closer to making the book a reality. Once I decided to make it, Phil went on to work\ntirelessly with Rodrigo to shape the aesthetic of what you are now holding in your hands\u2014doing so again solely as a gift. Thank\nyou, Phil!\n\nSix years ago, Jofie Ferrari-Adler, Executive Editor at Simon & Schuster, read the principles online, found them valuable, and\n\nexplained to me why sharing this book was an important thing for me to do to help others.
