I wrote this chapter to bring less\n\nexperienced investors up to speed with the principles of value investing.\n\nIn my opinion, good investing largely is common sense, made somewhat difficult by the behavioral imperfections of man. We can\nstart with the straightforward concept that, over the longer term, common stocks are an unusually attractive investment vehicle,\neven for an investor whose returns only equal the stock market\u2019s returns. During the 50-year period 1960 through 2009, the\naverage U.S. common stock provided an average annual total return (capital gains plus dividends) of 9 to 10 percent. In addition\nto providing this favorable return, common stocks are highly marketable and therefore can be purchased and sold easily without\nhigh frictional costs. Also, and importantly, if selected properly, common stocks offer considerable protection against risks of\npermanent loss. What could be better: favorable returns, high liquidity, and relative safety! That is a home-run combination, and\n\nthat is why Iam a great fan of common stocks.\n\nThe 9 to 10 percent average annual return provided by common stocks over the 50-year period makes economic sense. During the\nperiod, if adjustments are made for a few outlier years,1 the U.S. economy grew at roughly a 6 percent annual rate: about 3 percent\nfrom real growth (unit output) and about 3 percent from inflation (increases in prices). Corporate revenues during the period\nincreased in line with the economy, and corporate earnings roughly increased in line with revenues. While the price-to-earnings\n\n(PE) ratios of U.S. common stocks have fluctuated widely during the 50-year period, they seem to fluctuate around an average of\n\f"}, "003584.png": {"text": "about 16 times earnings. Therefore, before consideration of corporate acquisitions and share repurchases, common stocks have\n\nappreciated at about a 6 percent average annual rate over the years due to the growth of the economy.\n\nU.S. corporations, on average, generate considerably more cash than they require to support their growth. This excess cash can be\nused by corporations to pay dividends, acquire other companies, or repurchase their own shares. Over the past 50 years, dividends\nhave provided a 2.5+ percent yield, and acquisitions and share repurchases together have increased the earnings per share (EPS)\n\ngrowth of publicly traded corporations by close to 1 percent per year.\n\nThus, an average company\u2019s EPS has grown at about a 6 percent rate \u201corganically\u201d and at about a 7 percent rate including\nacquisitions and share repurchases. If one then adds the 2.5+ percent dividend yield to this 7 percent, the result is the 9 to 10\n\npercent total return that an average investor has received over the years from investing in common stocks.\n\nWhile it is difficult to project the future, assuming that the United States continues to be reasonably prosperous and capitalistic,\n\nI see no reason why the U.S. stock market will not continue to provide average annual returns of 9 to 10 percent over the longer\nrun, even if the U.S. economy grows at a somewhat slower pace than it has in the past. If future growth is somewhat dampened,\nthen corporations will not need to reinvest as much of their cash flows back into their businesses to support growth. Therefore,\ncorporations should have more free cash available to pay dividends, acquire other companies, or repurchase their shares\u2014and the\n\nincreased returns from these uses of cash should mostly or completely offset the reduced returns from the slower growth.\n\nIn spite of the many positive attributes of common stocks, I believe that many investors shy away from owning common stocks\nbecause they are fearful of the stock market\u2019s volatility, especially sharp downturns that are accompanied by negative news\nfrom the media and from Wall Street. Many consider volatility to be a risk. Importantly, when thinking about risk, I draw a sharp\ndistinction between permanent loss and volatility. The former is what it says it is: a loss that cannot be recovered. Permanent\nlosses are hurtful and should be avoided at all cost\u2014avoided like the black plague. They are decidedly detrimental to the creation\n\nof wealth. Volatility, however, is merely stocks or markets going up and down in price (not in value). Downward volatility usually\n\f"}, "003585.png": {"text": "is nerve-racking, but otherwise is quite harmless. Markets and stocks tend to fluctuate. They always have, and they probably\nalways will. Importantly, every time the market has declined, it eventually has fully recovered and then has appreciated to new\nheights. The financial crisis during the fall of 2008 and the winter of 2009 is an extreme (and outlier) example of volatility.\nDuring the six months between the end of August 2008 and end of February 2009, the Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) 500 Index fell by\n42 percent from 1,282.83 to 735.09. Yet by early 2011 the S&P 500 had recovered to the 1,280 level, and by August 2014 it had\nappreciated to the 2000 level. An investor who purchased the S&P 500 Index on August 31, 2008, and then sold the Index six years\nlater, lived through the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression, but still earned a 56 percent profit on his2\ninvestment before including dividends\u2014and 69 percent including the dividends that he would have received during the six-year\nperiod. Earlier, I mentioned that over a 50-year period, the stock market provided an average annual return of 9 to 10 percent.\nDuring the six-year period August 2008 through August 2014, the stock market provided an average annual return of 11.1\npercent\u2014above the range of normalcy in spite of the abnormal horrors and consequences of the financial crisis and resulting deep\n\nrecession.\n\nThus, it appears that the 2008-2009 financial crisis, as scary as it was, did not have a material long-term effect on the aggregate\n\nvalue of U.S. common stocks. The volatility during the crisis turned out to be inconsequential for the patient long-term investor.\n\nIn fact, an investor should treat volatility as a friend. High volatility permits an investor to purchase stocks when they are\n\nparticularly depressed and to sell the stocks when they are selling at particularly high prices. The greater the volatility, the greater\nthe opportunity to purchase stocks at very low prices and then sell the stocks at very high prices. But what happens when the price\nof a stock falls sharply after you purchase it? No problem, assuming that the stock was an undervalued investment at the price you\n\npaid for it. Eventually, the price of the stock should recover and then appreciate well above your cost basis.\n\nThis leads me to another important positive attribute of common stocks. An investor can decide the exact times he wishes to buy\n\nand sell a stock, and the only determinants of his success are the cost of the stock at the time of purchase and the price of the stock\n\f"}, "003586.png": {"text": "at the time of sale. While the unfortunate schoolchild\u2019s final grade in a subject usually includes his interim grades on homework\nassignments, class participation, pop quizzes, and interim tests, the only grade that counts for an investor is the profit earned on\n\na stock at the moment the investor decides to sell the stock. An investor might purchase shares of a company at $80. The price of\nthe shares might then decline to $40 (a failing grade) and remain at the $40 level for a full year (definitely a failing grade). Then\nthe shares might start rising, reaching a price of $160 three years after the investor made his purchase (an A+ grade). The investor\nmight then sell the shares at $160, thereby doubling his money in three years. When the investor receives his report card, his final\ngrade is A+. All the interim failing grades have been thrown out. It made no difference that the shares sold at $40 for a one-year\nperiod. The interim price was not relevant, unless the investor had been forced to sell the shares when they were at $40. Or unless\nthe investor had the resources and desire to purchase additional shares when they were at $40, in which case the $40 price was a\n\nblessing\u2014and the extreme volatility in the price of the shares functioned as a close friend.\n\nWhile many investors believe that they should continually reduce their risks to a possible decline in the stock market, I disagree.\nEvery time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting\nstocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or by any other method usually is expensive and, in the long run, is a waste of\nmoney. But how do you protect yourself if the stock market temporarily increases to excessively high levels, as it does from time to\ntime? Then, it is likely that individual stocks in your portfolio will be sold because their prices will have increased to levels where\ntheir risk-to-reward ratios have become unattractive, and it is also likely that the level of cash held in your portfolio will increase\n(maybe to a very large percentage of the portfolio) because it will be difficult to find attractive new ideas in an inflated market. The\ncash then provides protection from a decline in the market. However, and importantly, the buildup of the cash is not a conscious\n\neffort to provide protection against a decline in an excessively priced market, but rather is a result of the height of the market.\n\nThus, common-stock investors of average ability should be able to earn 9 to 10 percent average annual returns without taking\nlarge risks of permanent loss. I have a thesis to explain the particularly favorable reward-to-risk attractiveness of common stocks.\n\nThe return investors demand from any type of investment is a function of the perceived risk of the investment. The higher the\n\f"}, "003587.png": {"text": "perceived risk, the higher the demanded return. As discussed earlier, most investors incorrectly consider volatility to be a risk.\nThese investors thus demand a higher return from common stocks than the deserved return. This error is our opportunity\u2014and is\n\nanother reason we treat volatility as a friend.\n\nWhile the stock market itself is attractive, my goal, hope, and prayers are to materially outperform the stock market over time.\nMy specific objective is to achieve average annual returns of 15 to 20 percent without subjecting our portfolios to large risks of\npermanent loss. Happily, we have achieved these goals. Over the past 25 years, accounts that we manage have achieved average\nannual returns of very close to 19 percent. I attribute a material part of this success to a strategy that I developed in the early\n1980s. The strategy is to try to purchase deeply undervalued securities of strong and growing companies that hopefully will\nappreciate sharply as the result of positive developments that already have not been largely discounted into the prices of the\nsecurities. Our reasoning is that the undervaluation, growth, and strength should provide the protection we cherish against\npermanent loss, while the undervaluation, strength, growth, and positive developments should present the opportunity to earn\nhigh returns. We typically purchase shares in a company in anticipation that one or more positive developments will drive the\nshares within the next few years, and we then sell the shares after the positive development (or developments) has occurred and\nhas been substantially discounted into the price of the shares. Positive developments can include a cyclical upturn in an industry,\nthe development of an exciting new product or service, the sale of a company to another company, the replacement of a poor\nmanagement with a good one, the initiation of a major cost reduction program, or the initiation of a major share repurchase\nprogram. Importantly, the positive developments we predict should not already have been predicted by a large number of other\ninvestors. We need to be creative and well ahead of the curve. If we are not early, there is a likelihood that the future positive\n\ndevelopments already largely will have been discounted into the price of the shares.\n\nBut what if we are wrong about a stock and the predicted positive development fails to occur (which does happen)? Then, the\nundervaluation, strength, and growth of the stock still provide the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. If we cannot have the\n\nicing, we can at least have the cake.\n\f"}, "003588.png": {"text": "The above strategy of predicting positive changes makes common sense. At any one time, the price of a stock reflects the weighted\nopinion of the majority of investors. In order to earn outsized returns, we need to hold opinions about the future that are different\nand more accurate than those of the majority of other investors. In fact, it can be said that successful investing is all about\n\npredicting the future more accurately than the majority of other investors.\n\nPreviously, I stated that common stocks, if selected properly, offer considerable protection against the risks of permanent\n\nloss. But what criteria do we use to select stocks that offer that protection? Of course, there are no formulas for analyzing the\nrisks of permanent loss. It is said that if investing could be reduced to formulas, the richest people in the world all would be\nmathematicians. However, there are several signs to look for. A company that has a leveraged balance sheet (large quantities\n\nof debt relative to its cash flows and assets) may not have sufficient cash during difficult times to pay the interest it owes on its\ndebt, in which case it might have to file for bankruptcy (in bankruptcy proceedings, the common shareholder usually loses most\nof his investment). A company whose value is dependent on a single technology might permanently lose most of its value if the\ntechnology becomes obsolete. For example, digital cameras have obsoleted Kodak\u2019s chemical-based films, with the result that\n\nKodak has permanently lost most of its value. An investor also can suffer a permanent loss if he pays far too high a price for a stock.\n\nTo help minimize the risks of permanent loss, I look for a margin of safety in the stocks that we purchase. The concept of a margin\nof safety is that an investor should purchase a security at a price sufficiently below his estimate of its intrinsic value that he will\nhave protection against permanent loss even if his estimate proves somewhat optimistic. An analogy is an investor standing\n\non the 10th floor of a building, waiting for an elevator to carry him to the lobby. The elevator door opens. The investor notices\nthat the elevator is rated for 600 pounds. There already are two relatively obese men in the elevator. The investor estimates their\nweights at about 200 pounds each. The investor knows that he weighs 175 pounds. The investor should not enter the elevator.\nThere is an inadequate margin of safety. Maybe he underestimated the weights of the two obese men. Maybe the elevator company\n\noverestimated the strength of the elevator\u2019s cable. The investor waits for the next elevator. The door opens. There is one skinny old\n\f"}, "003589.png": {"text": "lady in the elevator. The investor says hello to the lady and enters the elevator. On his ride to the lobby, he will enjoy a large margin\n\nof safety.\n\nI note that our quest for a margin of safety makes us \u201cvalue\u201d investors as opposed to \u201cgrowth stock\u201d investors. As a value investor,\n\u2018we pay great attention to the price we pay for a security relative to our estimate of its intrinsic value. However, a growth stock\ninvestor pays considerable attention to the growth rate of a company and less attention to the price he pays for the growth.\n\nIf a growth-stock investor purchases shares in a company that is growing at a 15 percent rate and if he holds the shares for\n\nmany years, most of his returns will come from the growth as opposed to any change in the share\u2019s price-to-earnings (PE) ratio.\nTherefore, most growth investors are willing to pay a high PE ratio for a security. I have a problem with growth-stock investing.\nCompanies tend not to grow at high rates forever. Businesses change with time. Markets mature. Competition can increase. Good\nmanagements can retire and be replaced with poor ones. Indeed, the stock market is littered with once highly profitable growth\nstocks that have become less profitable cyclic stocks as a result of losing their competitive edge. Kodak is one example. Xerox is\nanother. IBM is a third. And there are hundreds of others. When growth stocks permanently falter, the price of their shares can fall\nsharply as their PE ratios contract and, sometimes, as their earnings fall\u2014and investors in the shares can suffer serious permanent\nloss. Many investors claim that they will be able to sell the shares of a faltering growth stock before the price of the shares declines\nsharply, but, in practice, it is difficult to determine whether a company is facing a temporary threat that it will overcome or\nwhether it is facing a permanent adverse change. And when it becomes apparent to an audience that there is a fire in a theater, only\na small fraction of the audience can be among the first to flee through an exit door. Therefore, many growth-stock investors do\n\nsuffer permanent losses.\n\nIn addition to shying away from paying high multiples for growth stocks, I tend to avoid the shares of weaker companies, even if\ntheir shares are selling at distressed prices. Some value investors are attracted to the deeply depressed shares of poorly positioned\ncompanies that have uncertain futures. I call these \u201ccigar butt\u201d investments. They are good for a few more puffs, but that is all.\n\nI strongly prefer purchasing undervalued shares of strong and well-positioned companies. My experience is that it sometimes\n\f"}, "003590.png": {"text": "takes a number of years for the prices of undervalued shares to increase to their intrinsic values or to be buoyed by positive events.\nDuring the time an investor owns a poorly positioned company, its intrinsic value might increase slowly, or, in some cases, might\neven decline to the level where the investor faces a permanent loss. However, the intrinsic value of a well-positioned company\nshould increase in excess of 7 percent per year.3 This is why we say that time is a friend of a good business and an enemy of a poor\n\nbusiness.\n\nInvestors often are faced with the choice of purchasing a riskier stock with particularly large upside potential or a much less risky\nstock with less upside potential. Our proclivity is to purchase the less risky stock because we are great believers in Warren Buffett\u2019s\ntwo rules to being a successful investor. The first rule is to avoid serious permanent loss, and the second rule is to never forget\n\nthe first rule. There are good reasons for this emphasis on risk avoidance. If an investor sells one stock at a 50 percent loss and\nreinvests the proceeds in a second stock, the second stock would have to appreciate by 100 percent before the investor recovers his\nloss in the first stock. Furthermore, large permanent losses can dampen the confidence of an investor\u2014and I strongly believe that a\ngood investor needs to be highly confident about his ability to make decisions, because investment decisions seldom are clear and\n\nusually are muddled with uncertainties and unknowns.\n\nOur strategies of being risk averse (but being indifferent to volatility) and of purchasing undervalued stocks of strong and growing\ncompanies that hopefully will appreciate sharply as a result of positive changes are important reasons for our success over\n\nthe years. But most other investors, including many who are highly intelligent and experienced, also have sensible investment\nstrategies and yet are unable to materially outperform the S&P 500 Index. Why? My strong answer\u2014and a key point in this book\u2014\nis that a successful investor also needs certain other abilities that are more behavioral than analytical. In particular, I believe that a\nsuccessful investor must be adept at making contrarian decisions that are counter to the conventional wisdom, must be confident\nenough to reach conclusions based on probabilistic future developments as opposed to extrapolations of recent trends, and must\nbe able to control his emotions during periods of stress and difficulties. These three behavioral attributes are so important that\n\nthey merit further analysis.\n\f"}, "003591.png": {"text": "BEING A CONTRARIAN\n\nBecause at any one time the price of a stock is determined by the opinion of the majority of investors, a stock that appears\nundervalued to us appears appropriately valued to most other investors. Therefore, by taking the position that the stock is\nundervalued, we are taking a contrarian position\u2014a position that is unpopular and often is very lonely. Our experience is that\nwhile many investors claim they are contrarians, in practice most find it difficult to buck the conventional wisdom and invest\ncounter to the prevailing opinions and sentiments of other investors, Wall Street analysts, and the media. Most individuals and\n\nmost investors simply end up being followers, not leaders.\n\nIn fact, I believe that the inability of most individuals to invest counter to prevailing sentiments is habitual and, most likely, a\ngenetic trait. I cannot prove this scientifically, but I have witnessed many intelligent and experienced investors who shunned\nundervalued stocks that were under clouds, favored fully valued stocks that were in vogue, and repeated this pattern year after\nyear even though it must have become apparent to them that the pattern led to mediocre results at best. One such example is a\ngentleman with whom I periodically dine to discuss investment ideas. I will call him Danny Dinner Date. Danny has a high IQ and\nhas been in the investment business for more than 40 years. He graduated near the top of his class from a rigorous private high\nschool and attended an Ivy League college. He worked for many years as a securities analyst and portfolio manager, and eventually\nheaded up a sizable investment management company. Danny\u2019s resume is A+. Yet Danny\u2019s investment results are only mediocre\u2014\nmaybe C or C+. Danny will listen intently when I describe an undeservedly depressed stock that likely should appreciate sharply\nin response to the expected easing of a temporary problem, and he frequently will appear interested in purchasing the stock.\nHowever, in follow-up conversations, Danny often will mention that he is waiting for some signal that the problem has eased\nbefore purchasing the stock. Of course, by the time such a signal becomes apparent to Danny Dinner Date, it is likely that the\n\neasing already has become apparent to many other investors and that the price of the shares already has discounted part or all of\n\f"}, "003592.png": {"text": "the forthcoming change. Danny, therefore, is prone to purchasing stocks that already have appreciated sharply. Because Danny is\nfully aware of his mistimings, I readily conclude that his inability to purchase stocks that are under a cloud is habitual. He simply\n\nlacks the ability to be a contrarian leader and instead becomes a follower of the herd.\n\nHAVING CONFIDENCE\n\nInvestment decisions seldom are clear. The information an investor receives about the fundamentals of a company usually is\nincomplete and often is conflicting. Every company has present or potential problems as well as present or future strengths. One\ncannot be sure about the future demand for a company\u2019s products or services, about the success of any new products or services\nintroduced by competitors, about future inflationary cost increases, or about dozens of other relevant variables. So investment\noutcomes are uncertain. However, when making decisions, an investor often can assess the probabilities of certain outcomes\n\noccurring and then make his decisions based on the probabilities. Investing is probabilistic.\n\nIn my opinion, reaching rational decisions in a probabilistic world requires confidence. I have observed that investors who lack\nconfidence often delay making decisions in quest of additional information that supports their views. Sometimes the delays\nbecome permanent and opportunities are permanently lost. Warren Buffett says that investors do not have to swing at every\npitch. But an investor who lets too many good pitches go by because he possesses the confidence to swing only at particularly \u201cfat\u201d\n\npitches may be called out on strikes before he ever sees a particularly fat pitch.\n\nDuring my career, I purchased many stocks that I should not have and failed to purchase other stocks that I should have. I often\nhave been asked how I can maintain my investment confidence in light of the many decisions that did not turn out as predicted.\nI have an answer to this question. To maintain my confidence and to guard against decision regret (becoming distraught over\n\nopportunities that were missed or over purchases that were unsuccessful), I draw a large distinction between the correctness of\n\nmy decisions and the outcomes of my decisions. If I carefully analyze a security and if my analysis is based on sufficiently large\n\f"}, "003593.png": {"text": "quantities of accurate information, I always will be making a correct decision. Granted, the outcome of the decision might not be\nas I had wanted, but I know that decisions always are probabilistic and that subsequent unpredictable changes or events can alter\noutcomes. Thus, I do my best to make decisions that make sense given everything I know, and I do not worry about the outcomes.\nAn analogy might be my putting game in golf. Before putting, I carefully try to assess the contours and speed of the green. I take\n\na few practice strokes. I aim the putter to the desired line. I then putt and hope for the best. Sometimes the ball goes into the hole,\nbut most often it misses. I do not worry about missing or the misses. By removing worry from the decision-making process in\ngolf and in investing, I can think more rationally and act more confidently\u2014and therefore make better decisions, especially when\n\ninvestment decisions are counter to the conventional wisdom or otherwise are difficult. And I can sleep at night!\n\nCONTROLLING EMOTIONS\n\nIhave observed that when the stock market or an individual stock is weak, there is a tendency for many investors to have an\nemotional response to the poor performance and to lose perspective and patience. The loss of perspective and patience often is\nreinforced by negative reports from Wall Street and from the media, who tend to overemphasize the significance of the cause of\nthe weakness. We have an expression that airplanes take off and land every day by the tens of thousands, but the only ones you\nread about in the newspapers are the ones that crash. Bad news sells. To the extent that negative news triggers further selling\npressures on stocks and further emotional responses, the negativism tends to feed on itself. Surrounded by negative news,\ninvestors tend to make irrational and expensive decisions that are based more on emotions than on fundamentals. This leads to\nthe frequent sales of stocks when the news is bad and vice versa. Of course, the investor usually sells stocks after they already have\nmaterially declined in price and usually purchases stocks after they already have materially increased in price. Thus, trading the\nmarket based on emotional reactions to short-term news usually is expensive\u2014and sometimes very expensive. John Maynard\nKeynes said the following about trading the market: \u201cMost of those who attempt it sell too late, buy too late, and do both too\n\noften.\u201d4\n\f"}, "003594.png": {"text": "On October 19, 1987, the S&P 500 Index declined by 20.9 percent due to panic selling. There were no apparent fundamental\nreasons for the sharp decline. That evening, the faces of my co-commuters on the train to Rye, New York, were ashen. As I exited\nthe train, I said hello to a friend who managed a medium-sized investment management firm. My friend, who looked most upset,\ncommented that the day\u2019s collapse in the market was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression\u2014that most investors\nlikely would lose confidence in the equity markets, triggering further declines in the prices of stocks, and that it would take years\nfor the markets to recover. My friend said that he had sold some stocks that day and intended to sell more on the following day. I\nwas dismayed by my friend\u2019s logic\u2014or, rather, lack of logic. Let us assume that my friend owned stock X on October 18 because he\nbelieved it was worth $14 versus its then selling price of $10. Let us further assume that the stock fell in line with the market on\nOctober 19 and closed the day at $7.90. My friend now intended to sell the stock at $7.90 even though the day earlier he believed\nit was worth $14. Such a sale would be nonsensical. My friend had acted on emotion, not on reason. And my friend\u2019s mistake was\n\ncostly. During the next two years, the S&P 500 Index appreciated by more than 50 percent.\n\nSeth Klarman, the founder of the Baupost Group, once said that \u201cpeople don\u2019t consciously choose to invest with emotion\u2014they\nsimply can\u2019t help it.\u201d5 Based on my observations, it would be easy for me to agree with Seth Klarman. I have continually seen\nintelligent and experienced investors repeatedly lose control of their emotions and repeatedly make ill-advised decisions during\nperiods of stress. Surely, these intelligent and experienced investors must realize that their emotions are central to their mistakes.\nWhy haven't they learned from the mistakes and tamed their emotions? Is their inability to think and act unemotionally during\nperiods of stress habitual, ingrained in their personality? I cannot be sure of the answers to these questions, but Iam not giving up\non the notion that human beings, through effort and thought, can repress their emotions sufficiently to make rational decisions\nduring periods of stress. All it takes is self-discipline\u2014maybe a lot of self-discipline, but not an insurmountable amount for\ninvestors who are willing to be challenged. Here is one approach. When an investor is barraged with particularly bad or good\nnews, he can reread the memos, notes, and models he wrote before the occurrence of the news. He then can ask himself three\n\nquestions: What really has changed? How have the changes affected the value of the investments under consideration? Am I sure\n\f"}, "003595.png": {"text": "that my appraisal of the changes is rational and is not being overly influenced by the immediacy and the severity of the news? By\nbeing aware of one\u2019s emotions and by consciously trying to control them, investors should be able to make better decisions. This is\n\nimportant because, in my opinion, overreactions to current news are a major cause of underperformance in the stock market.\n\nI believe that the readers of Chapters 3 through 13 will conclude that my abilities to be a contrarian, to invest with confidence, and\nto control my emotions are the principal reasons for my success over the years. Yes, the techniques of analysis that most books\nemphasize are important, but the importance is relevant only if an uncluttered, logical, confident, and unemotional mind has the\n\nability to use the techniques to make successful investment decisions. That is the crux of this book.\n\nTherefore, if an individual believes that he has the behavioral traits, plus the analytical skills and knowledge,\u00a2 to be a successful\ninvestor, I recommend that he should go for it and become an active investor who analyzes and owns common stocks. Active\ninvesting should work for him and provide above-average returns. And an active investor should enjoy the thrill and the\n\nintellectual satisfaction of analyzing, selecting, and owning stocks.\n\nHowever, if an individual believes that he does not have the ability to become a successful investor, he should invest passively\u2014\nin index funds or in broadly based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are designed to roughly equal the market\u2019s performance.\nThe recent proliferation of index funds and ETFs is evidence that many investors have concluded that they cannot outperform\nthe stock market over time. For the sake of our nation, I applaud this trend.

If I had been born with a different personality\nor been mentored by different educators or bosses, my investment styles, decisions, and successes likely would have been quite\ndifferent from what they are. Therefore, before trying to understand why I made certain investment decisions, I have provided\n\nsubstantial background about me. The background is divided into eight sections.\n\n1. WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO BE AN INDEPENDENT THINKER AND A CONTRARIAN\n\nI always have been an independent thinker who is willing and able to make decisions that are counter to the conventional wisdom.\n\nAccording to my parents, I was an independent thinker at a young age. Evidently, when in first grade, I gave my parents a difficult\ntime by questioning the existence of a myriad of intangibles, including God, Santa Claus, and the tooth fairy (even though the\ntooth fairy regularly placed quarters under my pillow whenever I lost a first tooth). I was the consummate Doubting Thomas. In\nhigh school, college, and, especially, Harvard Business School, I enjoyed the intellectual process of pioneering positions that were\n\noriginal or that were counter to those of other students and, sometimes, even to those of my teachers.\n\nOne example of my contrary and contrarian nature sticks out in my mind. In high school, my American history teacher was\n\nMr. Donald Erickson. Every school day, Mr. Erickson lectured on a particular event in our nation\u2019s history and then assigned us\n\f"}, "003598.png": {"text": "to read about the event that evening. His classes were boring. Totally boring. There was almost no class discussion, no critical\nthinking. I decided to be a renegade. At home, I found my father\u2019s college textbook on American history, which was considerably\nmore detailed and sophisticated than our high school text. I decided to read about various events in the college textbook before\nMr. Erickson discussed them in class and to memorize critical dates and outcomes. Then, when Mr. Erickson lectured about the\nevents in class, I was ready and eager to correct him if he made a mistake\u2014or to provide additional detail if he did not do an event\nsufficient justice: \u201cMr. Erickson, I believe that the defender of the Boston Tea Party was Samuel Adams, not John Adams, as you\nstated. Samuel Adams and John Adams were second cousins.\u201d A few days later in class: \u201cMr. Erickson, I believe that the Battle of\nSaratoga took place during the fall of 1777, not during the spring as you mentioned. It had to be the fall because General Burgoyne\ndid not start marching south from Quebec until June 13 and did not defeat the Americans at Fort Ticonderoga until July 7\u2014and\nthen he continued south to Saratoga, arriving in that area in mid-September.\u201d Finally, Mr. Erickson had had enough of me. He\noffered me a deal I could not refuse. Mr. Erickson was a neighbor and acquaintance of Henry A. Wallace, the former U.S. secretary\nof agriculture and vice president under Franklin Roosevelt. When serving as secretary of agriculture, Henry Wallace championed\na plan he called the Ever-Normal Granary. Mr. Erickson\u2019s deal was that if I interviewed Henry Wallace and wrote a paper on the\nEver-Normal Granary, I would be excused from attending classes for the remainder of the semester. I accepted the deal in two\nseconds (it took me that long to say \u201cyes\u201d). Interviewing a former vice president of the United States was a heady proposition for a\n\nhigh school senior. Much better than attending a totally boring class.\n\nThe Ever-Normal Granary was a simple concept. When large crop sizes of corn, wheat, or soybeans led to surplus supplies and\nconsequent downward pressures on prices, the government would intervene and purchase sufficient quantities of the crop to\nstabilize prices. The government would store the purchased inventories in granaries. Then, when small crop sizes led to threatened\nshortages and upward pressures on prices, the government would attempt to stabilize the market by selling part or all of the crop\nbeing held in the granaries. The government\u2019s actions to stabilize the agricultural markets theoretically would be good for both the\n\nfarmer and the consumer. It was a win-win situation.\n\f"}, "003599.png": {"text": "Thad two interviews with Henry Wallace. Both went well, and I started to write the requisite paper. Mr. Erickson believed that the\nEver-Normal Granary was an excellent concept and, of course, Henry Wallace was in love with it. I thought about the practicality\nof the Ever-Normal Granary and, with a sly sense of pleasure, arrived at a differing conclusion. My conclusion was that, if the\ngovernment stabilized prices at a relatively high level in a year that farmers produced excess supplies of a crop, the farmers would\nhave economic incentives to continue planting large quantities of the crop. Thus, except in rare times of poor weather, farmers\nwould continually produce excess supplies that the government would have to purchase. Eventually, the granaries would be filled\nto capacity. And then what? Furthermore, if the government stabilized U.S. prices at artificially high levels, what would prevent\nimporters from flooding the market with crops purchased at lower prices from other countries that also were experiencing\nsurplus crops? The concept of the Ever-Normal Granary sounded good on paper, but I concluded that it simply would not work in\npractice. Mr. Erickson, of course, was not happy with my conclusion, and he made me promise that I would not share it with Henry\nA. Wallace. So I was a 17-year-old contrarian to a former vice president of the United States\u2014and to my teacher to boot. But I did\nreceive an A+ as my final grade in American history, and I scored 97 on the final exam, even though I was absent from class for a\n\nlarge percentage of the semester.\n\nI strongly believe that my willingness and ability to be a contrarian is part of my DNA.\n\n2. MOTIVATION TO SUCCEED FINANCIALLY\n\nAt one time, there was considerable wealth in both my parents\u2019 families. But unfortunately or fortunately for my brother and me,\n\nmost of the wealth was lost over the years.\n\nMy father\u2019s great-grandfather, Michael Sampter, became prosperous as the founder of M. Sampter & Sons, one of the first\n\u201cready-made\u201d clothing companies. My grandmother, Elvie Grace Sampter Wachenheim, grew up in a Manhattan mansion with\n\ngovernesses and tutors. She vacationed with her parents and sister in Europe and spent summers at a family-owned lakefront\n\f"}, "003600.png": {"text": "estate in the Adirondacks, where an Indian guide from the Abenaki tribe led the Sampter girls on fishing, canoeing, and mountain\nclimbing trips. However, by the time my grandmother was in her mid-teens, M. Sampter & Sons no longer was profitable1 and\n\nmuch of the family fortune was lost.\n\nIn 1906, Elvie Sampter married Edgar Wachenheim, who at the time was a successful investment banker at Speyer & Co. Thus,\nmy father, Edgar Jr., also grew up in a household of some wealth. However, the Great Depression changed the fortunes of the\nWachenheim family. My grandfather shared in the profits and losses of Speyer & Co. By the mid-1930s, the profits had become\nlosses, and my grandfather decided to stem his losses by retiring. While the senior Wachenheims remained wealthy by the\nstandards of the 1930s, because of Speyer\u2019s losses in the early 1930s and because my grandfather retired at a relatively early age, he\n\nnever became wealthy by today\u2019s standards.\n\nOn my mother\u2019s side of the family, my great-grandfather, Samuel \u201cBoss\u201d Davis, founded a cigar company that, by the early\n\n1900s, had become, according to one of Boss\u2019s obituaries, \u201cone of the best known and most prosperous cigar manufacturing\nestablishments in the country.\u201d When Boss developed diabetes, he sold Samuel I. Davis & Co. to the American Tobacco Company\nfor $1 million, then a large sum. Upon Boss\u2019s death in 1918 (diabetes usually was fatal before insulin was purified in the early\n1920s), my great grandmother, Elizabeth \u201cBiggie\u201d Abohbot Davis, inherited the $1 million plus substantial other assets. Biggie\nlargely invested her fortune in mortgages and fixed-income bonds and, for the next 36 years, spent a meaningful percentage of her\nfortune on luxuries, including the upkeep of a large apartment that overlooked New York City\u2019s Central Park. When I was a small\nchild, I visited the apartment frequently. To this day, I have memories of dozens of large potted plants filling the spacious foyer and\nspilling over into adjoining rooms. To enter the large living room, one walked through a forest. A servant spent a large percentage\nof each day caring for the plants. Biggie\u2019s lavish lifestyle was unfortunate (pardon the pun) for the wealth of future generations.\nUpon Biggie\u2019s death in 1954, inheritance taxes were paid on what remained of her assets and the then residual was divided\nbetween her three daughters, with one-third going to my grandmother, Leonora \u201cLennie\u201d Davis Lewis. Sadly, Lennie\u2019s husband\n\ncontracted multiple sclerosis at a young age and could not work. Lennie had a sufficient income to live comfortably and to send my\n\f"}, "003601.png": {"text": "mother to private schools, but the Davis fortune largely was lost to poor fixed-income investment strategies, lavish spending, high\n\ntaxes, and disease.\n\nWhen I was growing up in the 1940s and 1950s, my parents\u2019 income consisted of my father\u2019s modest salary and some dividend\nand interest income from family trusts. My parents could afford to live in a nice neighborhood in New Rochelle, New York, and\ncould afford some luxuries, but I was aware that they lived on a tight budget. They definitely were not close to being wealthy. I\nalso was aware that there had been considerable wealth in the family and that the wealth had been lost. I am convinced that this\nknowledge motivated me to work hard in life to achieve financial success. Would have I worked as hard if I had grown up ina\n\nmansion serviced by servants? Probably not, and my observations of families that are wealthy support this conclusion.\n\nI strongly wish to add a paragraph in this book about values. My parents and grandparents were adherents of the ethics and values\ntaught by the Ethical Culture Society, which is a quasi-religion that teaches morality and ethics. My mother attended the Ethical\nCulture-Fieldston school system from kindergarten through 12th grade. Certain values were ingrained in the character and\nconduct of my parents and grandparents\u2014and, in turn, in my brother and me. We were taught that money should be used as an\nopportunity for achievement, not for vainglory. We were taught that one should care greatly about the welfare of other people and\nthat one should not spend lavishly on oneself. With these values in mind, the present conspicuous consumption of many ultra-\n\nsuccessful newly rich investment professionals makes me sick. Enough said.\n\n3. EDUCATION\n\nI was lucky enough to be continually stretched intellectually at rigorous schools and at demanding corporations. After two\nundergraduate years at MIT, I transferred to Williams College after deciding not to pursue a career in science. After Williams, at\nthe suggestion of Harvard Business School, I accepted a job at IBM, where I was forced to quickly learn a sufficient amount about\n\naccounting and business to participate in selling and installing large computer systems. I then attended Harvard Business School,\n\f"}, "003602.png": {"text": "where I was exposed to three business cases per day, six days per week, for two school years. Upon graduating from Harvard,\n\nI worked (too) long hours as a securities analyst at Goldman Sachs. After three years at Goldman, I accepted a job at Central\nNational-Gottesman Corporation (CN-G), which is owned by my wife\u2019s family. CN-G is a worldwide marketer and distributor of\nalmost every grade of paper and pulp. In the 1920s, CN-G started investing some of its excess cash flows in the stock market\u2014\nand by the 1950s the company had formed an Investment Management Division headed by Arthur Ross. Mr. Ross, as he liked\n\nto be called because he was a most formal man of the very old school, was a particularly successful investor and a particularly\ndemanding boss. Soon after I joined CN-G, Mr. Ross called me into his office: \u201cEd, you are not going to learn much sitting at your\ndesk. You need to be on the boards of companies. You need to be on the boards of companies\u201d (whenever Mr. Ross wished to\nemphasize a point, he repeated it at least twice, and sometimes thrice). Well, I was about 30 years old, had a crew cut, and looked\nabout 21. No company of any size and quality would want a relatively inexperienced 30-year-old on its board. Groucho Marx once\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t want to belong to any club that would accept me as a member,\u201d and I should have adopted the position that I would\n\nnot want to be a member of any corporate board that would accept me as a director.\n\nAfter much cajoling, three companies invited me to join their boards. Each was small. Each was weak. Each had serious problems.\nOne was a small, publicly owned grocery chain located in Portland, Oregon. At the start of my first board meeting, I was given a\nwarm welcome by the chairman and other directors. Then, as the meeting progressed, I quickly reached the conclusion that the\ncompany\u2019s earnings outlook was terrible, that the company\u2019s internal accounting controls were almost completely nonexistent,\nthat the board therefore needed to meet monthly rather than quarterly, that I did not have the time to fly to Oregon for monthly\nmeetings, and consequently that I should resign from the board posthaste\u2014which I did. Alas, I was a director of the company for a\n\ngrand total of one hour and forty-eight minutes. Maybe Groucho Marx was right.\n\nI then went on the board of a lead smelting company but resigned after a few years because my Ethical Culture background was at\nodds with management\u2019s continual delays installing proper equipment to eliminate the emissions of poisonous lead dust from the\n\nsmelters.\n\f"}, "003603.png": {"text": "Finally, I went on the board of American Saint-Gobain, a manufacturer of glass that just had completed the construction of a\nbrand new plate glass plant that immediately was obsoleted by the new and materially more efficient Pilkington float method\n\nof producing glass. American Saint-Gobain\u2019s new plate glass plant was a spanking new watermill at a time when American\nmanufacturers were beginning to tear down watermills in favor of steam engines. American Saint-Gobain then had to struggle to\n\nconvert its new plant to Pilkington\u2019s technology without going broke first.\n\nThus, my experiences as a 30-year-old director of three marginal companies were trials by fire. However, Mr. Ross was correct.\nBeing a director of marginal or submarginal publicly owned companies was a valuable educational experience that did make me a\n\nbetter investor. So thank you, Mr. Ross.\n\nWhen Arthur Ross retired in 1979, I assumed responsibility for the Investment Management Division of CN-G and became a\ndirector of the parent company, which was run by my brother-in-law. Eight years later, my brother-in-law and I decided that\npaper and investments were two disparate businesses that best should be separated from each other. I then became the owner\n\nof the investment operations, which I renamed Greenhaven Associates. For the next three years, I solely managed money for the\nGottesman and Wachenheim families, but eventually decided to manage money for some non-family members and for some not-\n\nfor-profits as well.\n\n4. ANALYTICAL SKILLS\n\nAll my life, I struggled with verbal skills, but had the innate ability to cut through complex math, science, and logic problems. I\n\nbelieve that this skill is part of my DNA and has been reinforced by my continuing rigorous education.\n\nThere is one part of my science background that I am not proud of, however. When in high school, I was asked to compete in the\n\u2018Westinghouse Science Talent Search. Competitors had to sit for an exam and then submit an original research project. As a 17-year\n\nold member of the New Rochelle High School varsity hockey team, my immature and unrealistic ambition was to become an NHL\n\f"}, "003604.png": {"text": "hockey star, not a scientist. Almost every afternoon, when the ponds were sufficiently frozen, I would drive to a nearby pond for a\ngame of shinny hockey, often cutting a class or two or three or four in the process. I was a hockey player, not a budding scientist. I\nhad neither the time nor the interest to spend afternoons in an indoor lab performing experiments for some dumb and stupid\nresearch project. Westinghouse definitely was a near-bottom priority. But I found a solution to having my cake and eating it too. I\nadopted the convenient thesis that inhalation of ozone would improve an athlete\u2019s performance. My brother and I had an old\ntransformer from our Lionel electric toy train set. By crossing a wire attached to one of the transformer\u2019s two terminals to a wire\nattached to the other terminal, I could create sparks. I had read that sparks convert some of the oxygen in the air into ozone. I\nborrowed 10 test tubes and 10 corks from my school\u2019s chemistry lab. One day, I rushed home from school and crossed the\ntransformer wires inside each of the test tubes, quickly corking each after removing the wires. I then grabbed my skates anda\nstopwatch. Reaching Larchmont Reservoir, I laced my skates and then placed two sticks on the ice about 200 yards apart. I gave the\nstopwatch to a friend and instructed him (my trusty research assistant) to start the watch when I said \u201cgo\u201d and stop the watch\nwhen I said \u201cstop.\u201d I then uncorked two of the test tubes, placing the open end of each to each of my nostrils. Luckily, nobody, except\nmy friend, saw me do this. Otherwise, they would have sent me to a lunatic asylum or worse. I inhaled the ozone from the two test\ntubes, skated to the starting stick, said \u201cgo,\u201d raced as fast as I could to the finishing stick, and, upon reaching it, said \u201cstop.\u201d I\nrepeated this procedure four more times. Then, without the benefit of either the ozone or much rest, I raced five more times\nbetween the two sticks. That was my control data. Voila, I had skated faster after inhaling the ozone than during the subsequent\nfive control skates. I had proved beyond my doubt (but nobody else\u2019s) that ozone is a performance enhancer. Thoughts of glamour\nran though my head. Maybe I would win first place in the Westinghouse. Maybe I would be the youngest person ever to win the\nNobel Prize in Chemistry. I could see the headlines in the New York Times: \u201cSeventeen-year-old Edgar Wachenheim III, star rookie\ncenter for the New York Rangers, was unanimously awarded the 1955 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pioneering work on the use\n\nof ozone to enhance athletic performance.\u201d\n\f"}, "003605.png": {"text": "Of course, in reality, my research project probably was the worst ever performed in the entire long history of the Westinghouse\nScience Talent Search, and my chemistry teacher summarily rejected it long before it was to be submitted to Westinghouse.\n\u201cWachenheim,\u201d the teacher criticized, \u201cdid it ever occur to you that exhaustion might have played a role in your slower times\nduring the last five skates? Wachenheim,\u201d the teacher continued, \u201cdid it ever occur to you that the small amount of electricity\nreleased by the transformer is totally insufficient to convert any oxygen into ozone? Thunderstorms, yes. Toy Lionel transformers,\nno. Wachenheim, I hope you play hockey better than you perform scientific experiments.\u201d And to complete the return to reality,\nnot only did I fail to earn any prize in the Westinghouse, but I was not even elected to the 1955 Westchester County High School\nAll-Star Hockey Team. So much for the Nobel Prize. So much for playing in the NHL. Dreams lost to reality. But it is far better for\n\nadolescents to dwell on dreams of future glory than to go through youth without ambitions\u2014without passions.\n\n5. CONFIDENCE\n\nBecause I was a strong student of math and science (in spite of the Westinghouse folly) who continually tested high for both\nachievement and aptitude, I gradually developed confidence in my innate analytical skills. This confidence was reinforced at\nHarvard Business School when, after my first year of study, I was elected a Baker Scholar. First-year Baker Scholars are those\n\nstudents whose grade average is among the top 2 percent in their class.\n\nBy the time I became responsible for managing portfolios of stocks, I was confident that I had the skill sets to become a successful\ninvestor. Importantly, this confidence gives me the ability to be a contrarian and to make decisions that are counter to the\n\nprevailing wisdom.\n\nIam aware, however, that investment success can breed overconfidence and a resulting unrealistically low assessment of risk.\nLuckily, I have made a sufficient number of mistakes in my life that there is little danger that I will become overconfident. In my\n\nopinion, a good investor needs to strike the right balance between confidence and humility.\n\f"}, "003606.png": {"text": "6. PRAGMATIC GOALS AND AMBITION\n\n \n\nLucius Annaeus Seneca, the Roman philosopher and statesman, once said: \u201cIf one does not know to which port one is sailing, no\nwind is favorable.\u201d I agree that investors should develop sensible and realistic goals. My goals have been to achieve average annual\n\nreturns of 15 to 20 percent over the longer term without taking large risks of permanent loss.\n\nI wish to emphasize the words longer term. Most hedge funds, mutual funds, and other investors are under pressure to please\ntheir clients by achieving favorable results in the short term. Many of these investors will shun (or even sell) a stock that has an\nuncertain short-term potential, even if the shares appear to be an excellent investment for the longer term. We are disinterested\nin short-term results and thus have the luxury of focusing our research and purchases on the much less competitive universe of\nstocks that have less promise of near-term appreciation, but that have exciting longer-term potential. This gives us a competitive\n\nedge.\n\nInote that achieving relatively low volatility is not a goal. However, because I tend to purchase undervalued securities of high-\nquality companies with strong balance sheets, over the years our portfolios have experienced less volatility than the stock market\n\nhas. The lower volatility has been the outcome, not the objective.\n\n7. CONTROL OF EMOTIONS\n\nOver the years, I have learned to control my emotions, especially when the prices of some or all of our stocks are falling sharply. I\nbelieve that part of the control is due to experience (I have been through so many bear markets that I am used to them) and part\nto my DNA. I simply find that, during times of stress, I am able to keep a relatively level head and to continue to think and act\n\nrationally.\n\f"}, "003607.png": {"text": "8.

Until the invention of the sewing machine in 1853, a family\u2019s clothing usually\nwas made by hand by the housewife or by a local seamstress to the individual specifications of the person who would\nbe wearing the clothing. The invention of the sewing machine sharply reduced the costs of making clothing. After the\ninvention, it became more economical to mass produce large quantities of clothes to meet anticipated orders rather than to\nproduce a single item to fulfill an order in hand, even if some of the mass-produced items later had to be marked down or\ndiscarded due to lack of demand for their size or style. In 1860, Michael Sampter formed his \u201cready-made\u201d clothing company\nto take advantage of the changed economics. M. Sampter & Sons prospered for the first several decades after its founding.\nPioneers tend initially to develop experiences and reputations that yield advantages over new competition. However, by the\nturn of the twentieth century, the manufacturing of clothes had become commodity-like, very competitive, and much less\nprofitable\u2014and M. Sampter & Sons floundered. The commoditization of products and manufacturing processes is normal. It\n\nis said that all products eventually become toasters.\n\f"}, "003609.png": {"text": "IBM\n\nIn 1914, Thomas Watson, a star salesman for the National Cash Resister Company, was hired by the Computing-Tabulating-\nRecording Company (CTR) to be its president. CTR had been founded three years earlier to produce electromechanical machines\nthat could \u201cread\u201d the location of holes in punched cards and make calculations and tabulations based on the location of the holes.\nFor the first time, machines were replacing pencils for accounting applications. Watson was a super salesman and leader, and\nsoon CTR became the world leader in tabulating office machines. In 1924, Watson, with infinite wisdom, changed the name of\n\nComputing-Tabulating-Recording to International Business Machines.\n\nIBM\u2019s punched card equipment was a great success, and by the 1940s IBM was the world\u2019s dominant producer of office business\nmachines. The business leased the punched card equipment under full-service leases that included maintenance and technical\nadvice as well as the equipment itself. IBM\u2019s strong financial incentive was to keep each piece of equipment on lease for as long\nas possible. While IBM earned good profits during the early years of a lease, if the equipment remained on lease after it was fully\ndepreciated, IBM\u2019s profits became particularly large. Thus, IBM had incentives to delay the introduction of new, more efficient\n\nequipment that would obsolete and replace existing equipment on lease.\n\nOver the decades, a number of inventors produced electromechanical machines that were at least somewhat programmable.\nThese were called computers. IBM's first computer was delivered to Harvard University on August 7, 1944, for use by the U.S. Navy\nBureau of Ships. IBM called the computer the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. But Harvard simply and wisely called it\n\nthe Mark 1. For the next seven years, IBM had little incentive to introduce programmable machines for the commercial market.\n\f"}, "003610.png": {"text": "After all, it did not wish to obsolete its highly profitable line of punched card equipment. However, in 1951, the Remington Rand\nCorporation delivered its first UNIVAC computer\u2014and IBM saw the handwriting on the wall. IBM knew that if it did not introduce\nits own line of commercial computers, its punched card equipment eventually would be replaced by UNIVACs, or by computers\n\nmade by other companies.\n\nIn 1952, IBM introduced its 701 vacuum tube computer, and the race was on. But it never was a close race. It was a cheetah against\na sloth. IBM benefited from vastly superior research, engineering, marketing, and applications knowhow. Furthermore, computer\nusers felt safe with IBM. Computers were new and complex, and corporations installing computers relied on the computer\nmanufacturer for technical and applications expertise. IBM was a highly respected and known quantity. If a corporate executive\nselected an IBM system and the installation developed problems, the corporate executive could blame IBM for the problems.\nHowever, if a corporate executive selected a non-IBM computer and the installation developed problems, the corporate executive\ncould be blamed by his bosses for selecting a second- or third-tier computer company, and the executive's career could be in\njeopardy. Thus, the vast majority of executives played it safe and stuck with IBM. UNIVAC, GE, RCA, Honeywell, and Burroughs\noften could offer more cost-efficient computers, but IBM usually received the orders. This was particularly true after IBM\nintroduced its technologically advanced System/360 family of compatible computers in 1964. The 360s were efficient, reliable,\nuser friendly\u2014and carried the IBM brand. IBM had a winner.\n\nThe System/360 transformed IBM into one of the most successful corporations ever. Between 1964 and 1974, the company\u2019s\nrevenues grew at a 14.6 percent average annual rate from $3.23 billion to $12.67 billion. Net earnings grew even faster, ata 17.5\npercent rate, from $364 million to $1,830 million. IBM\u2019s market share during the period approached 80 percent. Competitors could\nnot compete, and some quit. GE sold its computer business to Honeywell in 1970. One year later, RCA sold its computer business to\n\nSperry Rand.\n\f"}, "003611.png": {"text": "The seeds for IBM\u2019s eventual downfall came in 1972, when Intel developed its first microprocessor, the 4004. A microprocessor\nincorporates the functions of a computer\u2019s complex inner workings on a single integrated circuit, or, at most, on a few integrated\ncircuits. The first microprocessors were not sufficiently powerful to challenge the viability of IBM\u2019s System/360s and other\nmainframe computers. However, Intel cofounder Gordon Moore famously had predicted: \u201cThe number of transistors incorporated\nina chip will approximately double every 24 months\u201d\u2014and Gordon Moore proved correct. By the late 1970s, microprocessors were\nsufficiently powerful that relatively inexpensive desktop computers could start replacing expensive mainframes. In 1977, Apple\nintroduced the first successful desktop (personal) computer, the Apple II. The Apple II was a hit. Eventually, 1.25 million were sold.\nIBM noticed this success and noticed that microprocessor technology was progressing so rapidly that IBM\u2019s mainframe business,\n\nwhich was the source of most of the company\u2019s profits, was in jeopardy of being obsoleted. IBM had to respond.\n\nIn 1981, IBM introduced the IBM Personal Computer to replace its unpopular 5200 desktop computer. The IBM PC, backed by IBM\u2019s\n\nreputation for excellence, was a hit and helped drive IBM's sales and profits in the early 1980s.\n\nOther events also drove IBM\u2019s reported profits in the early 1980s. In 1980, John Opel became CEO of the company (Tom Watson\nhad retired in 1956 and Tom Watson Jr. had retired in 1971 after suffering a heart attack). Opel was concerned about IBM\u2019s policy\nthat a leased computer could be returned to IBM by a customer with 30 days\u2019 notice. His prime worry was that competitors, using\nadvanced microprocessor technology, would start marketing computers that were materially more cost effective than IBM\u2019s\nmainframes. IBM\u2019s mainframe customers would then cancel their leases with IBM, leaving IBM with substantially reduced profits\nand with inventories of relatively new, but technologically obsolete, computers. Responding to these concerns, Opel changed IBM\u2019s\npricing policy by offering to sell used mainframes at deeply discounted prices. The low prices encouraged customers to purchase\nthe mainframes they were leasing. By doing this, IBM immediately received revenues (the sales price of the used computer) and\nprofits that would have been received in later years if the computer had remained on lease. Thus, as long as customers converted\nleases into sales, IBM\u2019s reported revenues and profits were artificially inflated. Then, when the rate of conversions slowed, IBM\n\nchanged its terms on new leases that permitted the company to treat the leases as full payout leases. On full payout leases, most of\n\f"}, "003612.png": {"text": "the expected revenues and profits could be booked when the computers were delivered to the customers. Previously, the revenues\n\nand profits were booked over the life of the leases.\n\nThe introduction of personal computers, the conversion of leases to sales, and the new accounting for leases caused IBM\u2019s revenues\nand earnings to surge between 1980 and 1985. During the five-year period, revenues increased at a 13.8 percent average annual\nrate from $26.21 billion to $50.05 billion and net profits increased at a 14.1 percent average rate from $3.39 billion to $6.55\nbillion. IBM shareholders had much to be thankful for. The price of IBM\u2019s shares, adjusted for subsequent stock splits, rose from\n$16.09 at year-end 1979 to $38.88 at year-end 1985.\n\nHowever, all really was not well. Not well at all. When IBM developed its lines of personal computers, it adopted Intel\u2019s chip\ntechnology and Microsoft\u2019s MS-DOS operating system. This was a convenience. However, because other personal computer\nmanufacturers had equal access to Intel\u2019s chips and Microsoft\u2019s operating system, IBM lost any hope of significant product\ndifferentiation, and personal computers rapidly became commodities that were sold based on price. Over time, Dell, Compaq, and\n\nother PC manufacturers with lower cost structures than IBM would be able to outcompete IBM.\n\nIBM was facing additional problems as well. Computer power was increasing rapidly and was becoming less expensive. Moore\u2019s\nlaw was working. By the mid-1980s, personal computers could perform many of the jobs previously performed by mainframes.\nFurthermore, Digital Equipment\u2019s line of VAX minicomputers also was taking market share from IBM\u2019s mainframes. In addition,\nwhile in the 1960s companies heavily relied on IBM\u2019s technical expertise and reputation, by the mid-1980s many corporations had\nsufficient in-house expertise and experience that they no longer needed to rely on IBM. In the 1960s, IBM had pricing power, but by\n\nthe mid-1980s the company often had to price competitively to win orders.\n\nWhen relatively nondifferentiable products are sold based on their price, the manufacturers of the products normally need to have\nlow cost structures if they wish to be competitive and earn reasonable profits. Unfortunately, largely because of its history, IBM\u2019s\n\ncost structure was high\u2014very high. In the 1960s, IBM needed large numbers of salesmen and technical advisers to sell and install\n\f"}, "003613.png": {"text": "mainframes. It also needed large numbers of maintenance engineers to provide maintenance and repairs to its mainframes, which\nwere not nearly as reliable as computers produced 20 years later. By the mid-1980s, a large percentage of IBM\u2019s sales managers,\nsalesmen, applications programmers, technical advisers, and maintenance engineers were superfluous, but IBM maintained\n\na policy of not laying off any employee as long as he was not incompetent or dishonest. Many superfluous employees were\n\u201cpromoted\u201d upstairs to corporate headquarters to perform such less essential or nonessential tasks as competitive analysis, sales\nforecasting, quality control, real estate management, corporate relations, investor relations, community relations, and economic\nforecasting. In short, IBM\u2019s cost structure was bloated at a time when the company\u2019s revenues and gross margins were under\n\npressure from systemic adverse technological changes in the computer business.\n\nIBM\u2019s revenues continued to increase some in the late 1980s, but fell far short of the company\u2019s earlier hopes. In 1984, John Opel\npredicted that the company\u2019s revenues would reach $100 billion in 1990. Actual 1990 revenues were $69 billion. Earnings fared\nfar worse than revenues. After-tax earnings in 1990 were $6.02 billion, 8 percent below the level of five years earlier. And the price\nof IBM\u2019s shares even fared far worse than earnings, declining 27 percent between the last trading day of 1985 and the last trading\nday of 1990.\n\nJohn Akers replaced John Opel as CEO on February 1, 1985, at a time when IBM was bloated with more than 400,000 employees.\nIn 1985, I was invited by Jon Rotenstreich, IBM\u2019s treasurer, to have lunch at the company\u2019s headquarters in Armonk, New York.\nJon is a friend who previously had been a managing director of Salomon Brothers. We had lunch in the company\u2019s central dining\nroom. Jon looked around the dining room and pointed out employee after employee who came to the office every morning, but\nessentially had little work to do. \u201cSee that guy over there with the green tie? He used to be a regional sales manager. Now he is a\ncommunity relations specialist. He comes to the office at about 10 and grabs a cup of coffee. He is responsible for IBM\u2019s relations\nwith the hamlet of Armonk, so it is important for him to read the local Armonk weekly newspaper and watch for local Armonk\n\nnews on TV. That takes him the rest of the day, except for a two-hour lunch break and three or four additional coffee breaks. Get\n\f"}, "003614.png": {"text": "the picture?\u201d I got the picture. Jon strongly hoped that John Akers would abandon IBM\u2019s policy of lifetime employment and would\n\nsubstantially reduce IBM\u2019s payroll and other costs.\n\nAkers formed several task forces to study IBM and its future. The task forces\u2019 findings were worrisome. They concluded that\n\nIBM was in a state of decline. After reviewing the findings, Akers initiated a series of early retirement programs, offering large\nseverance packages to employees willing to leave the company. Of course, many of the most capable employees\u2014those readily\nable to find other jobs quickly\u2014accepted the package. So IBM lost a lot of talent and kept a lot of deadwood (adverse selection at\nwork). Furthermore, in spite of the retirement programs, IBM\u2019s employment levels only declined from 405,000 at the end of 1985\nto 374,000 at the end of 1990. During that period, IBM\u2019s fundamentals deteriorated faster than its employment levels. By 1990, for\nabout $100,000 a computer user could purchase a workstation that had the power of a mainframe that several years earlier had\nsold for a few million dollars. IBM suffered a large operating loss in 1991. Akers then had to act, and he did so by increasing the size\nof the retirement programs. IBM\u2019s employment levels declined to 344,000 at the end of 1991 and to 302,000 at the end of 1992.\n\nHowever, IBM still had far too many employees, morale was poor, and the company continued to lose money.\n\nI became interested in seriously thinking about IBM\u2019s shares in 1985 after my lunch with Jon Rotenstreich. My initial analysis was\nstraightforward. IBM no longer was a growth company with competitive advantages that led to high profit margins. Thus, it no\nlonger deserved to sell at a high price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. However, if the company could become cost competitive by sharply\nreducing its head count and by selling excess plants and office buildings, it could emerge as a large and powerful company that\nshould earn a reasonable return on revenues. Furthermore, the company would not have to spend large sums to build new plants\u2014\n\nand, therefore, a large percentage of its future earnings would be available for dividends or share repurchases.\n\nWhen I become interested in studying a company, I sometimes quickly purchase a few shares of the company\u2019s stock. Ownership\nincentivizes me to study the company with increased intensity. I purchased a few shares of IBM on two occasions between 1989\n\nand 1992, but sold the shares each time because I believed that IBM\u2019s problems could deteriorate further before they started\n\f"}, "003615.png": {"text": "to improve. The second time I sold the shares following a meeting with John Akers in his office. The legendary investor Mike\nSteinhardt owned shares of IBM. Mike knew that I also owned shares, and he invited me to join him in a meeting he had scheduled\nwith Akers. It took me one second to say \u201cyes\u201d to the invitation. However, the meeting turned out to be discombobulated because\nMike and I had completely different reasons for being interested in IBM. Mike observed that the company had a very profitable\nand rapidly growing subsidiary in Japan. In 1991, Japanese companies still sold at high PE ratios. Mike wanted IBM to spin off its\nJapanese subsidiary to IBM shareholders. He reasoned that the Japanese subsidiary alone would be worth a large percentage of\nIBM\u2019s existing market value and that the combined market value of the two pieces (IBM Japan and IBM ex-Japan) would be far in\nexcess of IBM\u2019s existing share price. I doubted the practicability of dividing IBM into two separate companies. Instead, I questioned\nAkers on why IBM was not reducing costs more aggressively. One minute Mike was asking about Japan, and the next minute I was\nasking about costs. Then, Mike had another thought about spinning out Japan, and then I had a thought about weeding out the\ndeadwood as opposed to incentivizing the most capable to leave IBM. It went back and forth for a full hour. Akers could not have\nbeen more courteous, but it was clear to me that he was not going to cut costs more aggressively\u2014and it was very clear to me that\n\nhe was not going to spin out Japan.\n\nIBM was doing poorly. Akers was under pressure and, in early 1993, announced his resignation. Lou Gerstner was his replacement.\nIBM held a press conference on the day Gerstner assumed control. Gerstner, who was wearing a very unlike-IBM blue shirt, told\nthe audience of reporters that he had the courage to take tough steps. That is what I wanted to hear. I decided to seriously consider\n\nmaking a large investment in IBM\u2019s shares.\n\nMy analysis was roughly as follows. I estimated that that company had about 60,000 more employees than needed and that an\naverage employee\u2019s compensation (salary and benefits) totaled about $85,000. Therefore, I concluded that Gerstner might be\nable to reduce costs by $5 billion. After taxes at a 32 percent effective rate, the cost reductions would add about $3.4 billion to net\nearnings, or about $1.50 per share based on the 2.29 billion IBM shares that were outstanding. Before nonrecurring charges, IBM\n\nwas roughly breaking even at the time. Therefore, I estimated that the company\u2019s current earnings power would be about $1.50\n\f"}, "003616.png": {"text": "per share pro forma a $5 billion reduction in costs. I further estimated that the company\u2019s revenues would grow at a 5 percent rate\nand therefore that IBM\u2019s earnings power in 1995 could be about $1.65 per share. When we purchase a stock, we are interested in\n\nwhat the company will be worth two or three years hence, so the $1.65 was an important number.\n\nIn order to check the reasonableness of earnings estimates, I often like to use two disparate methodologies when projecting\nearnings \u2014 and then see if the two methodologies reach similar conclusions. In the case of IBM, I decided to also use the following\nthought process. The company\u2019s revenues in 1993 were expected to be about $63 billion. Assuming a 5 percent growth rate,\nrevenues in 1995 would be about $69 million. Based on my experience, I estimated that an efficient manufacturer of computers\nthat was operating in a competitive environment might have after-tax profit margins of 5 to 6 percent. Based on this methodology,\n\nIBM's after-tax earnings power in 1995 would be $3.5 to $4.1 billion, or $1.50 to $1.80 per share.\n\nI decided to use $1.65 as a single best estimate of what IBM\u2019s earnings power could be in 1995. Finally, to value the shares, I\nassigned a multiple to the $1.65. I believed that IBM\u2019s quality and growth potential were somewhat below average. Since I believe\nthat an average company is worth 15 to 16 times earnings, I valued IBM at 12 to 13 times earnings. Thus, I estimated that, in\n1995, the shares would be worth $20 to $21.1 knew that my projections of IBM\u2019s earnings and values were nothing more than\nbest guesses based on incomplete information. However, having the projections to work with was better than not having any\nprojections at all, and my experience is that a surprisingly large percentage of our earnings and valuation projections eventually\n\nare achieved, although often we are far off on the timing.\n\nIBM\u2019s shares were selling at $12 at the time I completed my analysis in May 1993. Over the next two months, I purchased a\nsubstantial position in the shares at an average cost of about $111/2. We usually purchase stocks because we believe that one or\nmore positive changes will trigger a sharp appreciation in the price of the stocks. In this case, we hoped that IBM would announce a\n\ndefinitive plan to substantially reduce its costs.\n\f"}, "003617.png": {"text": "On July 28, Lou Gerstner announced a plan to reduce employment levels to 225,000 by the end of the year. About 85,000\nemployees, or slightly more than 25 percent of the existing workforce, would leave by year-end. Several months after the\nannouncement, both Lou Gerstner and his cost-reduction program started to gain credibility on Wall Street. In November, IBM\u2019s\nshares started to appreciate. By August 1994, the shares were selling at about $151/2. By that time, the common wisdom on Wall\nStreet was that Gerstner\u2019s cost-reduction program had been successful. It appeared that the company would earn about $1.25 per\n\nshare in 1994 and materially more in 1995.\n\nMy strategy is to purchase shares in anticipation of a positive change and then, normally, to sell the shares when the change\noccurs and is largely discounted into the price of the shares. In the case of IBM, the change had occurred and investor sentiment\nhad turned largely positive. At the time we had purchased the shares at about $111/2 the sentiment had been decidedly negative.\nBecause of the change in sentiment, I decided to sell our position, which we accomplished over the next few months at an average\nprice of just above $16. We earned a 40 percent profit in the stock. Yes, I had estimated that the shares might be worth $20 to $21\nin 1995, but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\u2014and I was happy to realize the 40 percent profit.\n\nSelling the shares turned out to be a big mistake because my analysis had been incomplete. In 1994 and in following years, IBM\ngenerated large amounts of excess cash. While a small portion of the cash was used for acquisitions, the largest portion was used\nto repurchase shares. IBM\u2019s average diluted share count declined by 1.7 percent in 1995, and then by 8.5 percent in 1996, and by\nanother 7.4 percent in 1997. As a result, IBM\u2019s per-share earnings increased materially faster than its net earnings. I had failed to\nconsider the repurchases. Also, my estimate that the company\u2019s after-tax profit margins should be 5 to 6 percent proved to be too\nconservative. In 1996, the company\u2019s after-tax margin was 7 percent, and IBM was on track to earn about 2.50 per share in that\n\nyear.\n\f"}, "003618.png": {"text": "In very late 1995 and in early 1996, I swallowed hard and rebuilt a large position in IBM\u2019s shares at an average cost of about $241/2.\nMy reasoning was that the combination of the share repurchases and the improved margins would lead to higher earnings per\n\nshare (EPS) than was generally predicted by Wall Street.\n\nWhile I was very wrong to sell the shares in 1994 at about $16, I was very right to purchase them again 15 months later. IBM\nearned $2.51 per share in 1996 and $3.01 per share in 1997, and the price of the shares increased sharply in response to the\nimproved earnings. I sold the shares in late 1997 at an average price of about $48. Again, my timing was far less than perfect. In\n\nmid-1999, the shares traded above $60.\n\nOver the years, I have learned that we can do well in the stock market if we do enough things right and if we avoid large permanent\nlosses, but that it is impossible to do nearly everything right. To err is human\u2014and I make plenty of errors. My judgment to sell\nIBM's shares in 1993 at $16 was an expensive mistake. I try not to fret over mistakes. If I did fret, the investment process would be\n\nless enjoyable and more stressful. In my opinion, investors do best when they are relaxed and are having fun.\n\nI continued to follow IBM after we sold the shares. The company struggled to grow. During the 15-year period from 1998 to 2013,\nIBM\u2019s revenues grew at only a 1.3 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR), from $81.7 billion to $99.8 billion. IBM, once one\nof the most respected growth companies in the world, now was a mature, slow growth company selling commodity-like products\n\nand services.\n\n\u2018Warren Buffett wrote in Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 annual report that, when Berkshire owns shares of a wonderful business,\n\u201cour favorite holding period is forever.\u201d I greatly admire Warren Buffett. He is one of the great investors of all time. But I strongly\ndisagree that the shares of most wonderful businesses can be held forever because most wonderful businesses become less\nwonderful over time\u2014and many eventually run into difficulties. IBM is one example of why most stocks cannot be held forever.\nKodak is another example. Coca-Cola, which is one of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s largest holdings, is a third example. Over the 10-year\n\nperiod 2003 to 2013, Coca-Cola\u2019s revenues and EPS increased at CAGRs of 8.3 percent and 7.1 percent, and the price of its shares\n\f"}, "003619.png": {"text": "increased at only a 4.9 percent CAGR.

I am tired when I finish the model at about 9:30 p.m. and promise myself that I will take a fresh\nlook at the model after a good night\u2019s sleep. After rethinking some of my assumptions and estimates, I make some inconsequential\nchanges to the model and print out a copy. I then write a one-page memo that explains the model and summarizes my conclusions\nabout the value of the shares. After proofreading the memo, I pack my briefcase, grab a bowl of cereal, and head to Greenhaven\u2019s\n\noffices in Purchase, New York, which are located about 15 minutes from our home in Rye.\n\nUpon arriving at our Purchase offices at just after 7:00, I give a copy of the FedEx memo and model to my assistant to distribute to\nGreenhaven\u2019s three securities analysts (my son Chris, Josh Sandbulte, and me) and to the firm\u2019s trader.

Originally, the company had expected\nthat its annual pension expense would decline to close to zero by 2017, but Chris learned that the actuarial tables used to compute\npension expense are being altered to reflect the longer life expectancy of Americans, and this alteration will cause the future\n\npension expense of many companies to be materially larger than previously expected.\n\nAfter the call ends, Chris and I review what we learned, and decide we are hungry and it is time for lunch. Frequently, Chris, Josh,\nand I lunch at a nearby restaurant. Today, we lunch at a local country club, where the food is good and the service is quick. Chris\nand I fill Josh in on our call with Nick Gangestad, and then we spend the rest of lunchtime brainstorming about industries and\ncompanies that might indirectly be helped by an upturn in the housing market. We do not come up with any worthwhile ideas. We\n\nusually strike out when we brainstorm. But we only need a handful of good ideas a year\u2014and we keep trying.\n\nWe return to the office at 1:45. Mary, my assistant, tells me that Todd Corbin, the chief investment officer of the New York Public\nLibrary, telephoned while I was out. Iam chair of the library\u2019s Investment Committee, which is responsible for the its $1.1 billion\nendowment, and Todd is the library\u2019s full-time employee who suggests strategies, recommends outside investment managers,\nand continually monitors the outside managers. At the previous committee meeting, I had raised a theoretical question. What, if\nanything, should the library do if the stock market climbs to excessive heights? Should the library hedge the stock market or ask\nsome of its managers to sell part or all of the equities they hold in the library\u2019s account? While I was not predicting that the stock\nmarket would climb to excessive levels, I thought it would be beneficial if we researched our options now so that we would be\nbest prepared to act in the future should the market rise sharply from present levels. I gave Todd and each committee member a\n\nhomework assignment to think about our options and strategies.

Protecting the portfolio might be more difficult than hoped. A small percentage of our equities\nare held in discrete accounts, but the bulk is held in pooled accounts. We can ask the managers of the discrete accounts to raise\ncash, but we have no control over the pooled accounts\u2014and we would not wish to withdraw our funds from the pooled accounts\nbecause the managers are good and most of them are no longer accepting new accounts. Therefore, if we withdraw the funds,\n\nwe likely would not be able to reinvest with them once we decided to again increase our exposure to equities. Todd had checked\non the practicability of purchasing put options on the S&P 500 Index, but the options seem to be prohibitively expensive. He also\nchecked on shorting the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index, but to do so the library would have to provide cash as collateral for any\n\nunrealized losses. Few things in life are easy. Todd said he would keep looking for ideas.\n\nI did not mind spending an hour with Todd. Over the years, I have spent considerable time with not-for-profits. Being on boards\nand committees is worthwhile, but chairing committees is particularly worthwhile because the buck stops with you and therefore\nyou are forced to become actively engaged. Over the years, I have chaired five investment committees, one executive committee,\ntwo finance committees, one audit committee, one art curatorial committee (at the Museum of Modern Art), two capital\n\ncampaigns, and two boards of trustees. In each case, I learned more than I gave\u2014and what I learned has made me a better investor.\n\nThe call with Todd ends. It is about 2:45. I return to analyzing the five smaller housing-related companies. I reject the first because\nit seems to be a higher-cost producer of undifferentiated products. I reject the second and third because their balance sheets and\ncash flows do not seem sufficiently strong. The time is now 3:45. I usually leave the office at 3:45 to 4:00.

The breads\nwere good and sold well. The success motivated Nafziger to build and purchase a number of real bakeries. Twenty years later, he\nsold the bakeries to a competitor, but soon afterwards used the proceeds from the sale to purchase a number of other bakeries\nthat, in 1930, he combined to form Interstate Bakeries. Over the next 30 years, Nafziger acquired 15 additional bakeries, building\n\nInterstate into one of the largest bread and snack cake companies in the United States.\n\nInterstate\u2019s business included distribution and marketing as well as baking. Bread has a relatively short shelf life. Therefore, it\nmust be delivered to stores soon after it is baked. To accomplish this, in the 1980s, Interstate operated a fleet of more than 3,000\ndelivery vehicles that transported its breads and other baked products to tens of thousands of supermarkets, smaller grocery\nstores, convenience stores, and restaurants. The drivers of the vehicles, who belonged to the Teamsters union, placed the newly\nbaked products on the shelves and removed the products that were not fresh. Most of the stale bread was sold at deeply discounted\nprices through 450 thrift stores operated by the company. The thrift shops were an unprofitable burden on the company but were\n\nnecessary.\n\nI became interested in Interstate in the fall of 1985 when a friend mentioned that Howard Berkowitz purchased 12 percent of the\ncompany\u2019s outstanding shares, became chairman of the company\u2019s board, and hired a new CEO, who was convinced that he could\nmaterially improve the company\u2019s profits. I knew Howard Berkowitz and believed that he was a particularly experienced and\n\nastute investor. Howard was a founding partner in 1967 of one of the earliest and most successful hedge funds: Steinhardt, Fine,\n\f"}, "003626.png": {"text": "Berkowitz & Co. By the mid-1980s, Howard had left Steinhardt, Fine, Berkowitz and had formed a new hedge fund: HPB Associates.\nIn my opinion, Howard was motivated, caring, and completely honest. I reasoned that Howard would not risk his own money\nand reputation on Interstate Bakeries unless he was quite confident that his investment would be a success. That is why I became\n\ninterested in the company\u2019s shares.\n\nI knew that the bakery business is a miserable business\u2014among the worst. Most shoppers do not have a strong preference for\none brand of bread over another. White bread pretty much is white bread. Whole wheat bread pretty much is whole wheat bread.\nThis relative lack of brand preference gives stores bargaining power over bakeries. A store can threaten a bakery that, if it cannot\npurchase bread at a certain price, it will seek another supplier. Thus, stores can play one bakery off against another, and they do.\nWarren Buffett likes businesses that are protected by moats. There are no moats surrounding the bakery business. There are not\neven any fences or \u201cbeware of dog\u201d signs. Therefore, the prices received by the bakeries often are driven to levels so low that it\n\nis difficult for the bakeries to earn a decent profit, if any profit at all. This is a key reason why the bread business is a miserable\n\nbusiness.\n\nThere are other reasons why most bakeries are a poor business. The Teamsters and other unionized employees have work\n\nrules that often prevent management from implementing efficiencies. And some of the unionized workers are participants in\nmultiemployer pension plans that the bakeries have little control over\u2014and that can become unquantifiable and burdensome\nliabilities to the bakeries. Furthermore, managements not only have difficulties controlling prices and labor, but also controlling\nraw material costs. The prices of wheat, sugar, and other bread ingredients fluctuate based on perceived supply and demand. And\n\nmanagement has no control over the price of the gasoline required to fuel the thousands of delivery vans.\n\nFor all these reasons, bakeries usually suffer from relatively low profitability and low cash flows. Moreover, because their cash\nflows are weak, they often struggle to generate sufficient funds to properly maintain and modernize their facilities. Even a mother\n\nwould have a hard time loving a bakery.\n\f"}, "003627.png": {"text": "Howard Berkowitz had become interested in Interstate Bakeries at a time when the company was suffering from legacy problems.\nIn 1979, Interstate had been purchased by a failing computer leasing company named DPF. DPF was in the process of liquidating\nits leasing operations and wanted to purchase another business to justify its continued existence. Also, DPF had large tax loss\ncarry-forwards that could be used to offset the tax obligations of an acquired company. In 1981, DPF finally exited the leasing\nbusiness and changed its name to Interstate Bakeries. Saddled with DPF\u2019s heavy debt load, the renamed Interstate lacked the\nfinancial resources to properly modernize and maintain its facilities. Furthermore, management lost focus on the bread business\nduring the years it had to concentrate on unwinding the leasing business. Interstate\u2019s profits slipped badly in the early 1980s, and\nthe company was unprofitable in 1984. One of Howard Berkowitz\u2019s first actions after becoming chairman of Interstate in 1984\nwas to replace the existing CEO with Bob Hatch, who had been an executive vice president at General Mills. Bob Hatch quickly\nannounced plans to reduce Interstate\u2019s debt and improve its profitability by divesting inefficient plants, optimizing the routing of\n\ndeliveries, and instituting general cost cutting and efficiencies.\n\nIn the fall of 1985, when I decided to analyze Interstate, its shares were selling at about $15.1 almost always start my analysis\n\nof a company by studying its balance sheet. It is said that a shareholder makes money off the income statement, but survives\n\noff the balance sheet, and I agree. Because of my keen desire to survive by minimizing risks of permanent loss, the balance sheet\nthen becomes a good place to start efforts to understand a company. When studying a balance sheet, I look for signs of financial\nand accounting strengths. Debt-to-equity ratios, liquidity, depreciation rates, accounting practices, pension and health care\nliabilities, and \u201chidden\u201d assets and liabilities all are among common considerations, with their relative importance depending on\nthe situation. If I find fault with a company\u2019s balance sheet, especially with the level of debt relative to the assets or cash flows, I\nwill abort our analysis, unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise. In the case of Interstate, Bob Hatch appeared to have\nperformed an excellent job reducing the company\u2019s debt and otherwise strengthening its balance sheet. Net debt had declined by\n$25 million in the company\u2019s fiscal year that ended on May 31, 1985, and was continuing to decline in fiscal 1986. I projected that,\non May 31, 1986, the company would have only $25 to $28 million of debt versus $85 to $88 million of shareholders\u2019 equity. Most\n\f"}, "003628.png": {"text": "other aspects of Interstate\u2019s balance sheet also appeared to be in good shape. I was concerned about one potential liability that was\nnot on the balance sheet: potential future liabilities to the multiemployer pension plans. But because the stock market had been\nstrong in recent years, one could reasonably conclude that the asset values of the plans had appreciated sharply and therefore that\n\nthey would not be a material liability to Interstate in the near future.\n\nIf a company\u2019s balance sheet passes muster, I then try to get a handle on management. The competence, motivation, and character\nof management often are critical to the success or failure of a company. To form an opinion on management, I normally pay\ncareful attention to the management\u2019s general reputation, read what the management has said in the past, assess whether the\nmanagement\u2019s stated strategies and goals make sense, and analyze whether the management has been successful carrying out\n\nits strategies and meeting its goals. However, I am humble about my abilities to accurately assess managements. Experience\nshows that investors can be unduly impressed by executives who are charismatic or who purposely say what investors want to\nhear\u2014who play to their audience. Also, investors frequently will undeservedly credit management for a company\u2019s favorable\nresults and vice versa. Favorable or unfavorable results often are fortuitous or unfortuitous. A number of years ago, I was one of\n\na few hundred securities analysts attending a particularly charismatic Wall Street presentation by Dennis Kozlowski, the CEO\n\nof Tyco International. At the end of the presentation, the audience burst into applause, and one attendee turned to me and said:\n\u201cKozlowski might be the single best executive in the country today.\u201d A few years later, Tyco was near bankruptcy and Dennis\nKozlowski was headed for prison. This is just one example of why one should be humble about his abilities to judge a management.\nWith respect to Interstate Bakeries, I had confidence that Howard Berkowitz had the ability and motivation to select a strong\nmanagement, and I was impressed by what Bob Hatch had quickly accomplished to improve the company\u2019s efficiency and balance\n\nsheet.\n\nAfter trying to get a handle on a company\u2019s balance sheet and management, we usually start studying the company\u2019s business\nfundamentals. We try to understand the key forces at work, including (but not limited to) quality of products and services,\n\nreputation, competition and protection from future competition, technological and other possible changes, cost structure, growth\n\f"}, "003629.png": {"text": "opportunities, pricing power, dependence on the economy, degree of governmental regulation, capital intensity, and return on\ncapital. Because we believe that information reduces uncertainty, we try to gather as much information as possible. We read\n\nand think\u2014and we sometimes speak to customers, competitors, and suppliers. While we do interview the managements of the\ncompanies we analyze, we are wary that their opinions and projections will be biased. From experience, we have learned that you\nshould never ask your barber if you need a haircut. In the case of Interstate, it did not take much work to conclude that that the\n\nbaking business was a lousy business\u2014a particularly lousy business.\n\nIt is usually difficult to analyze large quantities of information without the benefit of an insight on how to proceed with the\nanalysis. The insight permits us to separate the information that is critical for decision making from the information that is\n\nof secondary or tertiary importance. Once we have determined what is critical, we can start forming opinions and estimating\nearnings and cash flows. In the case of Interstate Bakeries, I isolated five fundamentals and estimates that appeared critical to\nour analysis of the company: (1) the balance sheet was OK; (2) management seemed competent and motivated; (3) the business\nwas low-margined and otherwise unattractive; (4) as a best guess, revenues might grow at a 5 percent average annual rate;\n\nand (5) a projection by Bob Hatch that pretax margins could increase to 3.5 percent within a few years seemed credible. I note\nthat, whenever we make estimates, we fully realize the impossibility of projecting the future with any certainty. Investing is\n\nprobabilistic.\n\nWhen analyzing a company, we almost always build a model of the company\u2019s past, present, and projected earnings. Model\nbuilding helps us structure our thinking and helps us analyze the importance of key variables. Our models normally include\n\nearnings projections for the next two or three years.\n\nOnce we complete building an earnings model, we usually have sufficient information to value a company. Normally, our\nvaluation is based on a multiple of projected earnings and cash flows. The multiple, in turn, is a function of a company\u2019s estimated\n\nstrengths and projected growth. Over the 50-year period 1960 to 2010, the stock market, as measured by the S&P 500 Index, sold\n\f"}, "003630.png": {"text": "at an average price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 15.8. Therefore, when valuing companies, I simply use a 15.8 PE ratio for companies of\naverage quality and growth potential, a PE ratio below 15.8 for companies of below-average quality and growth potential, and, of\ncourse, a PE ratio above 15.8 for companies of above-average quality and growth potential. It is often difficult to accurately value a\ncompany. However, my experience is that a knowledgeable and experienced investor who possesses good judgment can value most\ncompanies with sufficient accuracy that he can successfully base his investment decisions on the valuations. Valuations can be\n\ndirectional.\n\nMy Excel model for Interstate estimated that the company would earn $2.30 per share in its fiscal year 1988. My assumptions\nbehind the estimate were that revenues would grow at a 5 percent annual rate to $775 million, that pre-tax profit margins would\n\nbe 3.5 percent, that the effective tax rate would be 30 percent, and that the diluted share count would be 8.2 million.\n\nWhen valuing Interstate, my conclusions were that its longer-term business fundamentals were unfavorable, its management\nwas good and motivated, and its projected growth rate was somewhat below average. On balance, I valued the company at 11\ntimes earnings. Therefore, I concluded that, two years hence, Interstate\u2019s shares would be worth about $25, or about 66 percent\n\nabove their existing price of $15.\n\nAfter completing my valuation, my first reaction was that Interstate\u2019s shares were not sufficiently inexpensive enough to\npurchase given the unattractiveness of the business. However, I then had second thoughts. Howard Berkowitz had made a major\ninvestment in the company, and he was a knowledgeable gem. I like to follow sound and successful investors who are particularly\nknowledgeable about a company or industry they are investing in. Also, between mid-1982 and October 1985, the S&P 500 Index\nhad risen by about 68 percent from about 110 to about 185. In October 1985, most stocks were relatively expensive, and I was\n\nhaving difficulty filling our portfolios with stocks that appeared to be more attractive than Interstate\u2019s. I find that, in the stock\n\n \n\ni\n\n  \n\nmarket, it is best to be flexible and not be tied to conventions or rules. Sometimes, it is best to follow your intuitions\u2014and in the\n\f"}, "003631.png": {"text": "case of Interstate, my intuition was that we should own the shares. Over the next few months, I purchased about 8 percent of the\n\noutstanding shares of Interstate Bakeries at an average cost of roughly $15 per share.\n\nI note that the processes we use to value stocks and make investment decisions may appear to be ordered, but, in fact, they are\nquite messy. We constantly are faced with incomplete information, conflicting information, negatives that have to be weighed\nagainst positives, and important variables (such as technological change or economic growth) that are difficult to assess and\npredict. While some of our analysis is quantitative (such as a company\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio or a product\u2019s share of market), much\nof it is judgmental. And we need to decide when to cease our analysis and make decisions. In addition, we constantly need to be\nopen to new information that may cause us to alter previous opinions or decisions. It has been said that, if anyone thinks he has a\n\nformula for analyzing common stocks, he does not understand how to analyze common stocks.\n\nDuring the summer of 1986, Howard Berkowitz invited me to join Interstate\u2019s board as an ally of his interests. I accepted. My first\nboard meeting on October 15 was a sketch. The meeting was held near the company\u2019s headquarters in Kansas City. About a dozen\nbrown-nosing executives approached me, introduced themselves, welcomed me, and commented that they were happy to have me\non the board. I didn\u2019t know why they were happy to have me on the board. They had never met me before; they did not have my\nresume; they did not know the first thing about me. One executive, the head of marketing, handed me two enormous garbage bags\nfilled with samples of the company\u2019s products. Interstate made dozens of different types of breads sold under various labels and\ndozens of different types of snack cakes sold under the Dolly Madison and other brand names, and I was gifted a sample of each of\nthem. It was all I could do to lug the huge garbage bags around for the rest of the day and then stuff them into a taxi for the ride\nback to Kansas City International Airport. The real problem came at the airport. I could not check the garbage bags with the\nluggage, so I had to carry them aboard the airplane and try to fit them into the overhead storage compartments. They did not come\nclose to fitting. I pushed and pushed and squeezed and squeezed, but to no avail.

Passengers were shaking their heads in disbelief that a man in a formal dark pin-\nstriped suit with a red tie was lugging about 25 loaves of bread and dozens of boxes of donuts and cakes from Kansas City to New\nYork\u2014in garbage bags. Just as I was about to close one of the overhead compartments, a loaf of Millbrook Enriched Pumpernickel\nBread lost its balance and landed on a lady\u2019s head.

The next morning, I could hardly wait to show my wife, Sue, the wide variety of exciting\nproducts made by the company I had just become a director of. I displayed the breads and cakes on our kitchen countertops, which\nthey consumed. I thought that their carefully designed packaging brought credit to our kitchen. But Sue thought otherwise.\n\nShe was aghast when she read the ingredients listed on the labels: \u201cpartially hydrogenated animal shortening, cellulose gum,\n\nfolic acid, sorbic acid, thiamine mononitrate, artificial colors, artificial flavoring, sulfur dioxide.\u201d Sue turned to me: \u201cYou studied\nchemistry.

Between early 1986 and mid-summer 1986, the price of\nwheat fell from about $3.20 per bushel to as low as $2.25 in reaction to prospects for a large crop. Also, between the fall of 1985\nand mid-summer 1986, the price of crude oil collapsed from close to $30 per barrel to about $10. Because Interstate consumed\nlarge quantities of wheat and gasoline (for its delivery trucks), the sharp declines in the prices of wheat and crude oil were major\ncost savings for the company. When the prices of raw materials decline, competition usually forces companies to pass on most of\nthe cost savings to their customers, but with a lag. In the case of Interstate Bakeries, the cost savings were so large and the lag in\nprice reductions was sufficiently long that the company\u2019s profits increased sharply. In the fiscal year that ended on May 31, 1986,\nInterstate\u2019s pretax profits before restructuring charges were $14.6 million. A year later, the comparable number was $20.7 million.\nWhile a portion of the 42 percent increase in earnings should be credited to management's successful efforts to reduce costs, the\n\nlargest percentage by far was due to the sharp decline in the cost of wheat and gasoline.\n\nIn February 1987, Howard Berkowitz wisely decided that it was a good time to take advantage of the large increase in profits by\nselling the company. The board of directors readily agreed and retained Goldman Sachs to value Interstate and to advise on how it\nshould be sold. On March 27, Goldman told a committee of the board that, if the company was auctioned, its shares might be worth\n$32 to $35 if the purchaser was not in the baking business and might be worth up to $40 if the purchaser was a baker that could\nachieve strategic or synergistic benefits and eliminate a competitor. My original valuation had been $25 per share. Thus, I was\nsmiling.\n\nIn the spring of 1987, Goldman Sachs prepared a selling brochure and contacted possible purchasers. In the meanwhile, Bob Hatch,\nwho likely would have lost his job if Interstate was acquired by a competitor, contacted First Boston Corporation and suggested\n\nthat First Boston and he should form a group to purchase control of the company. First Boston agreed. On June 6, the Hatch-First\n\f"}, "003634.png": {"text": "Boston group offered to purchase all the shares owned by the largest shareholders for $35 per share. The purchase would have\ngiven the group effective control of the company. After the Interstate board turned down the Hatch-First Boston bid, Bob Hatch\ntold the board that it was a poor time to sell the company and suggested that the board terminate its efforts to sell. However,\nHoward Berkowitz held the chips\u2014and Howard wanted to realize his profits at a time when the company\u2019s profits seemed to be\n\ntemporarily inflated.\n\nEfforts to sell the company proceeded. Eleven parties showed a preliminary interest in acquiring Interstate, and four eventually\ndemonstrated sufficient interest that they were willing to sign confidentiality agreements that allowed full access to all of the\ncompany\u2019s confidential financial and operating data. The Hatch-First Boston group was one of the four parties. All the other three\nwere other baking companies. By showing interest in acquiring Interstate, a competitor could obtain a free look at Interstate\u2019s\nconfidential books. Thus, a competitor would be foolish if it did not show interest in acquiring Interstate, whether the interest was\n\nserious or feigned.\n\nOn August 11, Interstate issued a press release stating that it had received informal indications of interest in acquiring the\n\ncompany. In response to the release, the price of Interstate\u2019s shares jumped from $28.875 to $36.25.\n\nInterstate\u2019s board was concerned that the Hatch-First Boston group would be the only party seriously interested in purchasing the\ncompany and that the three competitor bakeries were only feigning serious interest. Therefore, it was decided that there would be\naclosed auction for the company. Bids would be submitted in sealed envelopes. At 5:00 p.m. on Friday, September 11, the envelopes\nwould be opened. The winning bidder would be required to sign a definitive purchase contract almost immediately after its bid\nwas accepted because the board was worried that, if the Hatch-First Boston group learned that it had been the only bidder, it\n\nwould renege on its bid.\n\nWhen the envelopes were opened by Goldman Sachs, Hatch-First Boston was the winning bidder at $38 per share.

Most of the meeting was conducted by Paul Roth of\nSchulte Roth & Zabel, the company\u2019s legal counsel for the transaction. Paul read the riot act. It was the legal responsibility of the\nboard to consider all offers for the company and all other alternatives. Before agreeing to the acquisition, the board had to make\n100 percent certain that the transaction was the best available option for the company\u2019s shareholders. Otherwise, the board would\nbe guilty of woeful neglect or much worse. The discussion and analysis of the alternatives then commenced. I have a type AA\npersonality, and after about two tedious hours of debate on whether Hatch-First Boston\u2019s amazingly and unwisely high bid was\nin the best interest of the shareholders, I lost patience and blurted out: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to step on a scale to know you are fat, and\nthis board has been weighing the Hatch-First Boston bid for two long hours on a scale that continually measures that the bid is\nso fat that it is in danger of breaking the scale. So let\u2019s approve the transaction and go back to our wives and children.\u201d Paul Roth\ngave me a dirty look and stated that I evidently had not been listening to his description of the legal responsibilities of the board.\nThe discussion and analysis then continued for another few tedious and seemingly unnecessary hours before the board formally\n\napproved the transaction.\n\nThe saga of the acquisition of Interstate was not complete on September 13. On October 19, the stock market fell apart. The S&P\n500 Index declined by 20.9 percent during the day. I was concerned that Hatch-First Boston, now aware that they were the only\nbidder and aware that they were overpaying for a miserable business, would claim force majeure, and would try to wheedle out of\nthe acquisition. Indeed, Hatch-First Boston did try to cancel the deal, but the purchase contract had been so tightly written by Paul\n\nRoth that there were almost no outs. On Monday, October 26, the acquisition was completed.\n\nThere is a postscript. The Hatch-First Boston group brought Interstate public again in 1991 and used the proceeds from the\n\noffering to reduce the company\u2019s debt. Then, in 1995, Interstate acquired Continental Baking, a troubled subsidiary of Ralston\n\f"}, "003636.png": {"text": "Purina, for $330 million in cash plus 16.9 million newly issued Interstate shares. Five years later, Interstate repurchased 15.5\nmillion of the 16.9 million shares held by Ralston Purina for $244 million. It appears that the repurchase was Interstate\u2019s undoing.\nThe repurchase increased Interstate\u2019s debt by $244 million and reduced its tangible book value by alike amount. On May 31,\n2001, Interstate had net debt of $595 million and a tangible book value of minus $20 million\u2014which, of course, is a totally\nprecarious balance sheet. The totally precarious balance sheet led to disaster three years later, when operating losses triggered a\nviolation in the company\u2019s bond indentures. The company was in deep financial trouble. On September 22, 2004, Interstate filed\nfor bankruptcy under Chapter 11. It did not emerge from bankruptcy until 2009, and then was forced to refile under Chapter 11\nin early 2012, partially because of large pension obligations to multiemployer union plans and partially because of inefficiencies\nstemming from restrictive work rules. In November 2012, the company announced that it could not continue as a going enterprise\nand intended to liquidate, selling off its various brands to the highest bidders.

While the company\u2019s shares were not deeply undervalued relative\nto the quality of the company, I decided to place a sizable bet on the shares because its chairman was particularly capable and was\nhighly incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders. The bet paid off. When Interstate\u2019s earnings surged due to sharply\nlower costs for wheat and gasoline, Howard Berkowitz was astute enough to realize that the surge likely was transitory. And\n\nbecause he owned 924,800 of the company\u2019s shares, he was highly incentivized financially to put the company up for sale.\n\nBob Hatch, however, owned relatively few shares. In my opinion, his primary incentive was to maintain his position as CEO. As\nCEO, he earned more than $500,000 per year and enjoyed substantial perks and prestige. What role did Bob Hatch\u2019s personal\ninterests play in his initial opinion that the company should not be sold? What role did his interests play in the high price that\nHatch-First Boston bid for the company, a winning bid that permitted Bob Hatch to remain CEO, but a bid that must have been\n\nbased on considerable wishful thinking?\n\f"}, "003637.png": {"text": "Ido not have definitive answers to these questions, but I do believe that managements and investors tend to act in their own self-\n\ninterest\u2014and I strongly suspect that Interstate Bakeries is a case in point.\n\nAnother lesson is that too much debt can be fatal. My father-in-law advised me to invest cautiously so that, under arduous\ncircumstances, we would survive and \u201clive for another day.\u201d When Interstate\u2019s management highly leveraged the company by\nrepurchasing $244 million of its shares, it jeopardized the financial viability of the company.

I screen for companies that are selling at low price-to-earnings (PE) ratios,\nlow prices to revenues, low price-to-book values, or low prices relative to other relevant metrics. Usually, the screens produce a\nnumber of stocks that merit additional analyses, but almost always the additional analyses conclude that there are valid reasons\nfor the apparent undervaluations. During my career, I probably have run thousands of screens, but only a tiny fraction of 1 percent\nhave resulted in a successful investment idea. Using screens to find investment ideas is like searching for a single pin ina field of\n\nhaystacks.\n\nIn mid-1994, while screening for companies selling at large discounts to their book values, I came across the name U.S. Home,\n\na builder of single-family homes. My early read showed that the company had entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1991 and had\nemerged from Chapter 11 in 1993 as a profitable company with an average-quality balance sheet for a homebuilder. The company\nhad a book value of about $27 per share and was earning about $2.50 per share. The shares were selling at about $17, or at only\nabout 0.63 times book and 6.8 times earnings. Very low multiples of book and earnings are adrenaline flows for value investors. I\n\neagerly decided to investigate further.\n\nI noticed that the law firm of Kaye Scholer had represented U.S. Home in its bankruptcy proceedings. I knew the managing\npartner of Kaye Scholer and gave him a call. It was a lucky call. The managing partner was very familiar with U.S. Home and its\nmanagement. In Kaye Scholer\u2019s opinion, U.S. Home had entered bankruptcy because of a weak housing market in Texas in the\n\nmid-1980s, followed by a general recession in the housing market in 1990. The company had been overexposed to the Texas\n\f"}, "003639.png": {"text": "housing market at a time when a sudden sharp decline in the price of crude oil led to a weak demand for new homes in oil-centric\nareas of Texas. Within a few months, demand turned so soft that U.S. Home was forced to close 36 of the 70 subdivisions it was\noperating in the Houston area. The soft market in the mid-1980s weakened the company\u2019s financial strength\u2014and then the\nhousing recession in 1990 served as a knockout punch. Importantly, according to my friend at Kaye Scholer, U.S. Home\u2019s financial\nproblems had been created by external problems and, except for its finances, the company had been well managed, efficient, and\n\nhighly regarded.\n\nlimmediately developed the thesis that U.S. Home's shares were undeservedly depressed because of the stigma of the bankruptcy.\nI reasoned that, with time, the stigma would diminish and the shares would appreciate. I then started to learn more about the\n\ncompany and its industry.\n\nU.S. Home was formed in 1959 upon the merger of several small homebuilders. The company grew organically and by acquisition\nand, by the mid-1980s, had revenues in excess of $1 billion. The company seemed to enjoy a good reputation for producing\nquality homes, and it seemed to be growing. Its net debt was somewhat high, but the debt was backed by inventories of raw land,\ndeveloped lots, and homes under construction. There was nothing wrong with the company, but there was nothing to write home\n\nabout it.\n\nHomebuilding seemed to be an industry of average quality and average growth potential. The business works as follows.\nHomebuilders normally purchase large tracts of undeveloped land. They then seek permits from local authorities to subdivide and\ndevelop the land. Development includes the construction of roads and the laying of water, sewage, natural gas, and electrical lines.\nThen, homebuilders normally build a few model homes and open the subdivision for business. While the models and some other\nhouses in a subdivision are built before they are sold, most homes are not built until a sales contract is received and a deposit is\n\npaid. After a house is completed, a certificate of occupancy is received, and title then passes to the purchaser.\n\f"}, "003640.png": {"text": "Historically, most single-family homes were built by local builders. Eventually, some of the local builders became larger, expanded\ngeographically, and became publicly owned. The larger publicly owned companies enjoy efficiencies of scale and, importantly,\naccess to the capital markets. The access generally gives the public companies an advantage when borrowing to finance the\n\npurchase of raw land, the development of lots, and the construction of homes.\n\nI studied U.S. Home\u2019s financial statements, constructed an earnings model, and concluded that the company could earn $3 to $4\nper share by 1996 or 1997. Initially, I valued the company at about 12 times earnings, and therefore believed that the shares would\nbe worth $36 to $48 two or three years down the road. However, I noticed that other builders typically sold for somewhat less\nthan 12 times earnings. For some reason, the homebuilding industry was not highly regarded on Wall Street. In fact, the industry\nearned the pejorative nickname \u201cstick builders.\u201d Therefore, I toned down my expectations. However, even if U.S. Home\u2019s shares\nwere worth only 10 times earnings, they appeared to be an attractive investment opportunity given that they were selling at only\n\n$17 at the time. So, I started buying the shares.\n\nIt turned out that U.S. Home was a frustrating holding. The company itself did fine, much better than I expected. Between 1994\nand 1999, the company\u2019s revenues increased by 91 percent, and its earnings more than doubled from $2.50 per share to $5.30 per\nshare. Given these results, the shares should have been an out-of-the-park home run. But they were not. The shares continued to\nsell at 6 to 7 times earnings. Management tried to promote interest in the shares. Bob Strudler, the company\u2019s chairman, told U.S\nHome\u2019s story to anyone who would listen. On March 5, 1997, the company held a full-day meeting for securities analysts. I thought\nBob Strudler did an excellent job explaining the company\u2019s strategies, strengths, and growth potentials, but to no avail. In June, the\n\nshares sold at a lower price than they had sold at in early March.\n\nIn 1998 and 1999, I spoke to Bob Strudler frequently. Usually when I speak to an executive of a company, my questions are honed\nin on the fundamentals of the company\u2014on new products, competition, strategies, and finances. But my conversations with Bob\n\nwere centered on why his stock sold at 6 to 7 times earnings and at a material discount to its book value. We both were perplexed.\n\f"}, "003641.png": {"text": "U.S. Home was a well-managed, successful company. Almost no decent company sold at 6 to 7 times earnings and at a discount to\nbook value. U.S. Home was a value investor\u2019s dream. I recommended the stock to a number of other money managers. The shares\n\ncontinued to sell at 6 to 7 times earnings. I was more than frustrated.\n\nFinally, in early 2000, somebody else recognized that U.S Home was selling at a bargain price. The somebody was another\nhomebuilder, Lennar Corporation. Lennar acquired (really \u201cstole\u201d) U.S. Home for $34%/4, or for only 6.6 times earnings. Usually,\nwhen a company bids to acquire one of our holdings, we have cause to celebrate. Champagne corks pop. But I had no cause to\ncelebrate receiving 6.6 times earnings for U.S. Home's shares. We had owned the shares for about six years and had about doubled\nour money. That works out to an average annual return of about 12 percent. Since our goal is to achieve average annual returns of\n\n15 to 20 percent (and hopefully closer to 20 percent than 15 percent), the investment was not successful.\n\nHowever, there is a bright side to the story. Ownership of U.S. Homes\u2019 shares led us to one of the most profitable investment ideas\n\nin our history\u2014to a home run.

My curiosity was aroused, so I checked the recent growth rates of other publicly\nowned homebuilders. They also were growing much faster than their industry. What was going on? If the public homebuilders\nwere growing faster than their industry, then the private homebuilders must be lagging. Why were they lagging? I picked up the\nphone and called a friend who built a few homes each year in lower Westchester County. My friend thought that my inquiry was ill\n\ninformed\u2014in fact, dumb: hadn't I ever heard of the S&L crisis?\n\nIn the 1980s, savings and loan banks (commonly known as S&Ls or thrifts) were badly squeezed by high interest rates. Many of\nthe mortgages that the S&Ls issued in the 1960s and 1970s were at fixed and relatively low interest rates. Then, in the late 1970s\nand in the early 1980s, interest rates increased sharply. To attract the requisite level of deposits, the S&Ls were forced to pay\nhigh interest rates on deposits. As a result, their net interest margins often were insufficient to cover their overhead expenses.\nFurthermore, when the real estate market softened in 1990, many of the loans issued by the S&Ls went into default. The S&Ls\nwere in deep trouble. Many declared bankruptcy and closed. Others were forced to merge. The crisis became so severe that the\nFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which had been established by an act of Congress in 1934, had to be abolished\n\nbecause it became too insolvent to save.\n\f"}, "003643.png": {"text": "Historically, the S&Ls and community banks provided the bulk of the financing needed by small homebuilders to purchase land,\ndevelop land, and construct houses. During the housing recession of 1990, many small homebuilders suffered operating losses\nand could not repay their loans. As a result, most of the S&Ls and banks that did survive the crisis were less eager to lend to small\nbuilders. With less financing available and with tightened lending standards, many small homebuilders lacked sufficient capital\nto build nearly as many homes as they had built previously. Some small builders decided to finish existing projects and then\nretire. Others decided to build at reduced rates. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of homes built by small builders continually\nand materially declined. The vacuum was filled by the publicly owned homebuilders. This explains why the large builders were\n\ngrowing at a much faster rate than their market.\n\nI quickly calculated the growth rates of several large builders. In 1999, Centex built 27 percent more homes than in 1998.1,\nComparable growth rates for Pulte and Lennar were 20 percent and 17 percent. Something was happening that was big. Stick\nbuilding had become a growth industry. Stick builders were growing as rapidly as most Internet companies. I made a model of\nCentex\u2019s earnings. I assumed that, for the next several years, the company sold 12 percent more homes each year and that the\naverage price per home increased at a 2 percent annual rate. Next, I looked at profit margins. Centex\u2019s pretax earnings in 1999\nequaled 8.1 percent of sales. Surely, if the company\u2019s revenues increased at a 14 percent annual rate, its profit margins would\nbenefit from positive leverage over fixed costs. After studying some historical numbers, I estimated that Centex\u2019s pretax margins\nwould reach 10 percent by 2003. Thus, my model estimated that the company\u2019s revenues would increase from $6,008 million in\n1999 to $10,150 million in 2003 and that its pretax earnings would increase from $482 million to $1,015 million. After taxes at a\n35 percent effective rate and based on a share count of 125 million, my model projected 2003 after-tax earnings at $5.25 per share.\nBecause the homebuilding industry was becoming a growth industry (I would no longer call the companies \u201cstick builders\u201d), I\nvalued Centex at 12 times earnings. Therefore, I estimated that the shares would be worth about $63 in 2003. At the time I reached\nthis conclusion, the shares were selling at less than $12. I did not wait a minute.

I could not find a single Wall Street report\nthat concluded that the public homebuilders would enjoy accelerated growth at the expense of the private homebuilders.

I was literally jumping up and down with excitement. I could not wait, and immediately started\n\npurchasing shares of Centex and several other homebuilders.\n\nI faced the question of how many shares of Centex and other homebuilders to purchase. There is no single correct answer to the\noptimum diversity in a portfolio. My own policy is that no single stock should equal more than 12 percent of the total value of a\nportfolio and that no single industry should equal more than 25 percent of the total value. When measuring the percentages, I use\nthe cost of the stock rather than its market price. That way, I am not forced to reduce the size of a position that appreciates faster\n\nthan the portfolio as a whole.\n\nOur concept that the large homebuilders would grow rapidly at the expense of the small homebuilders was a creative idea. Because\nIhave been interested in how we can optimize our creativity, over the years I have tried to learn how others successfully generate\noriginal ideas. I have yet to find an answer, but I did find that the following excerpts from an analysis by Professor Robert Harris\n\nwere helpful:\nCreativity is the ability to generate new ideas by combining, changing, or reapplying existing ideas.\nVery few works of creative excellence are produced with a single stroke of brilliance or in a frenzy of rapid activity.\n\nCreativity is also an attitude: the ability to accept change and newness\u2014a willingness to play with ideas and possibilities, a\n{flexibility of outlook, the habit of enjoying the good, while looking for ways to improve it. Creative people usually do not have a need\n\nto conform and are not afraid of failure.2\n\f"}, "003645.png": {"text": "It is difficult to find creative investment ideas. Thinking is hard work. Most investment ideas that run through one\u2019s head already\nhave run through the heads of others, and therefore likely already have been largely discounted into the prices of stocks. If you\nhave reason to believe that the price of oil will increase sharply, but if the likelihood of sharply higher oil prices already has become\nthe conventional wisdom among investors, then it probably is too late to purchase the shares of companies that own oil reserves.\nMorning after morning, lunch after lunch, afternoon after afternoon, I try to find new creative investment ideas\u2014but the vast\nmajority of the time I strike out. Thus, my research efforts usually are tedious and frustrating. I have hundreds of thoughts andI\nstudy hundreds of companies, but good investment ideas are few and far between. Maybe only 1 percent or so of the companies we\nstudy ends up being part of our portfolios\u2014making it much harder for a stock to enter our portfolios than for a student to enter\nHarvard. However, when I do find an exciting idea, excitement fills the air\u2014a blaze of light that more than compensates for the\n\nhours and hours of tedium and frustration.\n\nOur idea that the publicly owned homebuilders would enjoy materially accelerated growth is consistent with Professor Harris\u2019s\nanalysis. We generated the new idea by observing trends in an old idea (U.S. Home). We were unwilling to conform to Wall Street\u2019s\n\ngeneral view that stick building was a relatively unattractive cyclical business. We were not afraid of failure.\n\nBy mid-2000, we had built a large position in Centex and a few other homebuilders. Centex was by far the largest of the holdings,\nlargely because I was particularly impressed by the company\u2019s CEO, Larry Hirsch, and by the company\u2019s general reputation for\nquality. Now, we just had to monitor our holdings, try to relax, and wait to see if our analyses and projections would prove to be\naccurate. I note that we are most relaxed at the times when we purchase a security and when we sell a security, but it is often\ndifficult to relax in between. There is a reason for this. Greenhaven\u2019s goal is to achieve average annual returns of 15 to 20 percent\non its investments. Because we make mistakes, to achieve 15 to 20 percent average returns, we usually do not purchase a security\nunless we believe that it has the potential to provide a 30 percent or so annual return. Thus, we have very high expectations\n\nfor each investment. After we purchase a security, there are two possibilities. The unlikely possibility is that the security starts\n\f"}, "003646.png": {"text": "appreciating at above a 30 percent or so annual rate, in which case we are relaxed and smiling. The more likely possibility is that\n\nthe security fails to appreciate at a 30 percent or so annual rate, in which case we are disappointed and unrelaxed.\n\nThere is another consideration. We are prone to sell securities that have exceeded our expectations and hold securities that have\nyet to meet our expectations. Thus, at any one time, because we have sold our winners, our portfolio is heavily weighted toward\n\nstocks that have lagged our expectations. Owning laggards is neither fun nor relaxing.\n\nBecause the homebuilders had become a sizable investment, over the next several years, we continually and particularly carefully\nmonitored the progress of the companies. I was generally happy that the large homebuilders continued to gain market share.\nCentex sold 61 percent more homes in 2003 than in 1999. Furthermore, Centex\u2019s pretax margins had increased to 11.1 percent and\nits earnings per share had increased to $6.01 in 2003 versus $2.11 in 1999. Responding to the sharply higher earnings, the price of\nthe company\u2019s shares had appreciated to about $40, more than three times the price we had paid for the shares three years earlier.\n\nHowever, the shares still were selling at far less than 10 times earnings, which was a frustrating disappointment\u2014and an enigma.\n\nOn a warm and humid day in mid-July 2003, I found a number that intrigued me. The U.S. Census Bureau keeps track of the\nnumber of housing units being built in the United States. On the twelfth business day of each month, the Bureau releases data\n\nfor the previous month. The data for June showed that the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts during the month\nwas 1,867,000, up 6.7 percent from May and up 8.7 percent from the previous June. Those are large increases for an industry that\nshould only grow in line with the growth of the U.S. population. Something was going on. I needed to find out what. The answer\nseemed to lie with the economy and mortgage rates. In the late 1990s, there was a boom in the prices of technology stocks. In fact,\nthe boom developed into a bubble. The increased wealth created by the boom contributed to a strengthened economy. In turn, the\nstrengthened economy triggered an increase in interest rates. Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates increased from about 7 percent\n\nin 1997 to about 8 percent in 2000. Then, the technology bubble burst and the economy softened. Thirty-year fixed mortgage\n\nrates declined to about 7 percent by early 2001. The terrorist attacks on 9/11 were a second and severe blow to the economy.\n\f"}, "003647.png": {"text": "Immediately following the attacks, many Americans were not in the mood to travel or to purchase large-ticket items. Responding\nto the weak economy, the Federal Reserve Bank sharply reduced interest rates. Ninety-day T-bill rates fell from about 3.5 percent\njust before the attacks to about 1.7 percent by year-end 2011. 30-year fixed rate mortgages fell from about 7 percent before the\nattacks to just over 6 percent a year later and then to about 5.2 percent by mid-2003. With mortgage rates at 5.2 percent, the\npurchase of a new house was more affordable than it had been for quite a while. Many families decided to take advantage of the\n\naffordability, which was the apparent reason why the demand for new houses had increased to above-normal levels.\n\nThe number of houses that can be built at any one time is limited by the availability of permitted and developed building lots.\nBecause of local opposition, it often requires several years to receive permits to develop raw land. Opposition due to environmental\nimpacts often is particularly sticky. I once read about a proposed housing development that was delayed several years because of\nlocal concerns about the well-being of a family of frogs that reputedly lived in a stream that crossed the property. My kidding and\nimpolitic solution to the concerns and delays was saut\u00e9ed frog legs, but the local conservationists evidently did not care for frog\n\nlegs, and they dragged their opposition into the courts.\n\nBecause of the time required to permit and develop land, by mid-2003 the demand for new homes was increasing faster than\nbuilding lots could be permitted and developed. The result was a shortage of new homes in many parts of the country. When anew\nhousing development finally was ready to accept orders, often there were many more hopeful purchasers than available homes.\nLong lines developed in front of the selling offices. To be near the front of a line, some families camped out at the development for\none or more nights. With demand exceeding supply, housing prices started to increase at above normal rates. Newspapers started\ncarrying articles about the price increases. Many newspaper journalists and economists predicted that housing prices would\ncontinue to increase quite sharply for the foreseeable future. These predictions incentivized additional families to purchase new\nhomes before prices did increase further. Hence, the boom fed on itself. By the fall of 2003, seasonally adjusted housing starts\n\nreached an annual rate of 2 million\u2014and likely would have been higher had there been a greater availability of developed lots.\n\f"}, "003648.png": {"text": "It may seem counterintuitive, but I was unhappy about the sudden boom in single-family houses. We believed that the normal\nannual demand for new housing units in the United States was about 1,600,000.

A recalcitrant\nwayward teenager who hates his parents is unlikely to run away from home and purchase, to quote from an advertisement, a \u201cnew\nperfectly proportioned 4 bedroom, 3.5 bath house with cathedraled ceiling master bedroom; large beautifully landscaped 0.8 acre\nyard contiguous to a permanently deeded nature preserve; close to nationally awarded schools and fine shopping.\u201d With housing\nstarts at a 2 million annual rate, clearly more houses were being built than needed. Future demand had been pulled forward, first\nby the attractive affordability and then by the expectation of continually rising prices There may have been some pent-up demand\nfor houses coming out of the 2001-2002 recession, but, sooner or later, if housing construction continued at late 2003 levels, there\nwould bea surplus of unsold homes\u2014and the housing industry would cycle downward. When we purchased Centex and the other\nhomebuilders, we hoped they would grow steadily for many years at double-digit rates as they gained market share. We also hoped\nthat their shares would sell at higher price-to-earnings (PE) ratios as they became viewed as growth stocks rather than cyclical\nstick builders. However, if the industry cycled downward, we might suffer through a period of declining earnings and declining PE\n\nratios. That is why I was unhappy about the spurt in the demand for new houses.\n\nThe housing boom continued through 2004 and 2005. Centex continued to benefit from the boom.

At the end of 2004, Centex owned 96,945\nbuilding lots, up 25 percent from the end of 2003. To finance these purchases, Centex\u2019s net corporate debt increased by more\nthan $500 million in 2004. I thought that the company was making a large and dangerous mistake. At a time when the housing\nindustry was abnormally strong, Centex should have been husbanding its cash and minimizing its purchases of high-priced land.\nThe risks in owing shares in the homebuilders clearly had increased. I started to call them stick builders again, and I started to\n\nreduce our holdings.\n\nI badly needed to speak to Centex\u2019s management. Larry Hirsch had retired as CEO in 2004 and had been replaced by Tim Eller. I\ncalled Tim and arranged an appointment to see him on November 15. I decided to bring along an acquaintance, Jim Grossfeld, who\npreviously had been CEO of Pulte Homes and whom I had met and respected when we both were directors of Interstate Bakeries.\nThe meeting with Tim Eller was stormy. I tried to understand the thinking behind Centex\u2019s strategy of paying high prices for land\nat a time when home construction was at an unsustainably high level. It was clear to me that an excessive number of houses were\nbeing built in the United States and eventually there would be a correction that likely would lead to lower prices for houses. If\nCentex received lower prices on new homes that were sitting on top of high-cost land, the company could suffer serious operating\nlosses and value impairments. Tim did not agree with my reasoning. He maintained that the large homebuilders would continue\nto gain market share and therefore that Centex would need all the land it was purchasing. He thought it unlikely that housing\nprices would decline, even during a slowdown. His argument was that house prices never had declined before. I took strong\nexception to this reasoning. It is dangerous to project past trends into the future. It is akin to steering a car by looking through\nthe rearview mirror (which is OK while the road remains straight, but a catastrophe when the car comes to a curve). We agreed to\ndisagree. I was frustrated. I was angry. My father always told me to slowly count to 10 whenever I was angry, and then the anger\nwould disappear. I counted to 10 very slowly. I was still angry. I counted to 10 again. I remained angry and frustrated.

Tim Eller seemed\n\noblivious to the risks.\n\nI decided to sell all our holdings in the homebuilders. I could not wait for signs that the demand for new homes was weakening.\nWhen purchasing or selling securities, we try to act ahead of developments. We were out of our holdings by early 2006. We sold\nour Centex shares at roughly $70, or close to 6 times what we had paid for the shares. The investment was a complete winner, but\nI felt that it could have been even more profitable if the housing bubble had not occurred because the homebuilders eventually\n\nwould have earned respect and sold at much higher PE ratios.\n\nWhile I was happy with the outcome of our investments in the homebuilders, I was not completely happy or fulfilled. I usually am\nthat way: a happy and optimistic person who, at the same time, is unhappy that he is not doing better. Put it this way: I would be\nless than happy if I were not constantly striving to do better. A desire and striving to do better seems to be part of human behavior,\n\nat least my human behavior.\n\nThe housing crisis that followed the bursting of the bubble was worse than I would have imagined. Who is to blame for the crisis?\nCertainly the banks, Wall Street firms, and mortgage brokers that aggressively oversold risky mortgages are partially to blame. And\ncertainly the homebuilders, who misjudged the fundamentals of their business and overexpanded, are partly to blame. But also\nto blame are the many families who overpaid for houses\u2014the Tom and Jane Smiths who were not at all interested in purchasing a\nhouse at a reasonable price in 2002, but who then camped out and overpaid for a house in 2005 because they believed that prices\nwould continue to rise. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, the average price for a new single-family home increased from\n$228,700 in 2002 to $292,200 in 2005. Even adjusting for inflation, the Tom and Jane Smiths materially overpaid\u2014and then\nlikely financed their purchases with mortgages that were larger than the houses would have been worth in 2002\u2014and materially\nlarger than the houses were worth after the bubble burst.

It would have been impolitic to criticize the Tom and Jane Smiths for their indiscretions.\n\nSeveral months after we sold our holdings in Centex and several other homebuilders for happily large gains, I received an unhappy\ntelephone call from Bill Summer, a client who was in the real estate business. Bill complained that, because of the large realized\ncapital gains in the homebuilders, he now was faced with an unhappily large tax bill. He added that he did not like paying taxes to\nthe government and that, in his real estate business, he had found ways to permanently defer paying taxes. He asked me to review\nhis portfolio and sell all his stocks that had unrealized losses so that he could offset the realized gains with losses. I explained to\nhim that we luckily did not have any sizable unrealized losses. Furthermore, if we realized losses in stocks and then repurchased\nthe stocks 31 days later, clients would establish lower cost bases and therefore eventually would realize larger gains when we sold\nthe shares. The larger gains would negate the tax savings of realizing the losses. Greenhaven typically holds stocks for two to four\nyears. Thus, clients who sell shares to take tax losses merely would be deferring realized gains for a few years. And there are some\ndistinct disadvantages to selling attractive stocks for the purpose of realizing losses. There are transactional costs when stocks are\npurchased and sold. Also, there is an upward bias to the stock market, so, on average, it will cost something not to own a stock for\n31 days. Further, and importantly, if a stock is sold and then repurchased, the stock needs to be held for one year and a day from\nthe date of repurchase to be treated as a long-term capital gain. If we desire or need to sell a repurchased stock at a profit within one\nyear of when it was repurchased, any gain on the transaction would be taxed at ordinary rates. Thus, while tax loss selling permits\nclients to, in effect, borrow money from the government at no cost, I believe that the disadvantages of tax loss selling normally\n\noutweigh the advantages\u2014and I told that to Bill.\n\nA few days later, Bill called back, still grumbling about his tax bill. I told him that we were committed to making investment\ndecisions that were in the best interest of our clients and that, while tax loss selling made sense to us a small fraction of the time,\nit did not make sense to us most of the time.

A horse can travel about five miles per hour over moderate\ndistances. For the next 3,800 years, technological innovation for traveling on land was almost nonexistent. In 1800, the horse still\n\nwas the prime method of transportation on land\u2014and still at about five miles per hour. So 3,800 years of stagnation!\n\nEverything started to change in 1769 when James Watt designed an efficient steam engine. Originally, steam engines were used to\npower pumps and industrial machinery, but soon inventors saw the potential to use the engines to power boats. While anumber\nof steamboats were built by entrepreneurs as early as 1787, Robert Fulton became known as the father of steam navigation when,\non August 7, 1807, his Clermont completed the 150-mile trip from New York to Albany in 32 hours\u2014still an average speed of five\n\nmiles an hour.\n\nIf steam engines could be used to power boats, why couldn't they be used to power wagons that ride on tracks? They could. In\n1814, a self-educated British laborer named George Stephenson designed the world\u2019s first steam locomotive to operate on tracks.\nThe purpose of the locomotive was to haul coal from the mouth of a mine. Eleven years later, the first common carrier railroad,\nthe Stockton & Darlington Railroad Company, was formed. Stephenson designed a locomotive for the Stockton & Darlington that\ncould pull 6 coal cars and 21 small passenger cars over nine miles of track in about one hour\u2014already nearly twice the speed of a\n\nhorse.\n\nIn the United States, the city of Baltimore decided to build a railroad to Ohio to compete with the Erie Canal, which, at the time,\n\nwas the least expensive transportation route from the farms in the Midwest. On July 4, 1828, with great fanfare, Charles Carroll,\n\f"}, "003654.png": {"text": "the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, symbolically dug a spade of dirt to commence construction of the\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O). In early 1830, the B&O became America\u2019s first commercial railroad when it started operations\non 13 miles of completed track. But expansion to Ohio was slow. Bridges had to be built, tunnels dug. In 1868, the B&O finally\nreached the Ohio River. Then, three years were required to construct a bridge to span the river. At last, in 1871, the railroad reached\n\nthe farmlands of Ohio.\n\nThe almost immediate commercial success of the B&O in the 1830s and 1840s sparked a boom in the construction of railroads. By\n1840, about 3,000 miles of track were in operation. By 1860, about 30,000 miles. Between 1815 and 1860, the cost of moving farm.\nproduce and manufactured goods over long distances fell by 95 percent. In 1860, trains could average about 20 miles per hour over\na 24-hour day. The horse was on the way out for long distance travel. The railroads had revolutionized transportation. They were\n\nthe Internet of their day.\n\nSoon, the growth and potential profitability of railroads attracted the attention of Cornelius Vanderbilt, Edward Harriman, Jay\nGould, and other wealthy businessmen and speculators, who purchased control of many regional railroads in order to create local\nmonopolies that could set high rates (i.e., prices). In 1887, the U.S. Congress, responding to complaints from many farmers and\nother users of railroads about the high rates, passed the Interstate Commerce Act, which made the railroads subject to federal\nregulation. The act formed the five-member Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which had the power to regulate many\n\naspects of the railroads, including the rates they could charge.\n\nThe railroads continued to grow and generally prosper until the 1920s, when the automobile started to erode passenger travel by\nrail. Then in the 1930s, the railroads suffered heavily during the Great Depression. Their revenues declined by about 50 percent\nbetween 1928 and 1933\u2014and by 1937 many were in receivership. At the outset of World War II, the entire railroad industry was\nin trouble. War-related traffic from 1942 to 1945 brought a reprieve to the industry\u2019s stressed condition, but the reprieve was\n\ntemporary. Soon after the war ended, the construction of the interstate highway system gave trucks a competitive advantage over\n\f"}, "003655.png": {"text": "railroads for many types of cargo. By the mid-1970s, the railroad\u2019s share of intercity freight traffic had declined to 35 percent,\ndown from 75 percent in 1930. Usage of railroads to carry passengers also declined sharply after the end of the war, partially due\n\nto the construction of the interstate highway system and partially to the commercialization of the jet airplane.\n\nThe plight of the railroads was further aggravated by poor and excessive regulation. The ICC established rates. In an effort to help\nfarmers, rates for grains and other bulk farm produce generally were kept low, while rates for manufactured goods generally\nwere kept relatively high. The high rates for manufactured goods incentivized many manufacturers to switch to transportation\nby trucks. Thus, the railroads faced adverse selection. They lost many of their most profitable shippers to trucks, while still being\nsaddled with their marginally profitable agricultural shippers. Furthermore, many of the ICC\u2019s multitude of rules and regulations\n\nstifled the introduction of such efficiencies as unit trains.\n\nThe railroads were in trouble. In the 1960s and 1970s, many went bankrupt, including, on June 21, 1970, the once venerable\nPenn Central, one of the largest and most important railroads in the country. Finally, even the U.S. government recognized that\nchange was needed. In 1978, the U.S. Department of Transportation noted that \u201cthe current system of railroad regulation ... is\n\na hodgepodge of inconsistent and often anachronistic regulations that no longer correspond to the economic conditions of the\nrailroads, the nature of intermodal competition, or the often-conflicting needs of shippers, consumers, and tax payers.\u201d (\u201cA Short\nHistory of U.S. Freight Railroads,\u201d paper by the Policy and Economics Department of the Association of American Railroads, April\n2013, page 5.)\n\nIn 1980, Harley Staggers, chair of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, introduced an act that essentially\nderegulated the railroads. Under the Staggers Act, railroads could establish any rates they chose, unless the ICC determined that\nthere was no effective competition for the service. Other provisions of the act increased the flexibility of the railroads to provide\n\nefficient service. For example, procedures for abandoning unprofitable lightly used tracks were streamlined.\n\f"}, "003656.png": {"text": "The Staggers Act was a breath of fresh air. Railroads immediately started adjusting their rates to make economic sense.\nUnprofitable routes were dropped. With increased profits and with confidence in their future, railroads started spending more\n\nto modernize. New locomotives, freight cars, tracks, automated control systems, and computers reduced costs and increased\nreliability. The efficiencies allowed the railroads to reduce their rates and become more competitive with trucks and barges.\nAccording to the Association of American Railroads, the average inflation adjusted rate charged by the railroads, expressed in 2012\n\ndollars, declined from about $0.07 per ton-mile in 1981 to below $0.03 in 2003\u2014an amazingly large decline.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the railroad industry also enjoyed increased efficiencies through consolidating mergers. In the west, the\nBurlington Northern merged with the Santa Fe, and the Union Pacific merged with the Southern Pacific. As a result of the mergers,\nonly two large railroads remained to serve the western half of the country. With increased efficiencies of scale and with reduced\ncompetition post the mergers, both the Burlington Northern Santa Fe and the Union Pacific could stabilize their earnings at a time\n\nwhen their rates were still declining.\n\nDuring the 2001-2002 recession, Union Pacific\u2019s management reduced the railroad\u2019s costs in order to mitigate the effects of the\nslowdown. Employment levels were reduced by 8.1 percent, from about 50,500 in 2000 to about 46,400 in 2003. The reduced\ncosts permitted the railroad to enjoy larger earnings in 2003 than in 2000. However, the reductions left the Union Pacific with\ninsufficient capacity when demand for rail transportation accelerated in 2004. The insufficient capacity led to serious congestion\non many routes. An analogy might be traffic jams on a highway during rush hour. Too much traffic on a highway, and the traffic\nslows and backs-up. Union Pacific\u2019s congestion caused its profits to decline. Its trains took longer to reach their destinations. A\nrailroad\u2019s revenues are a function of ton-miles, but many of its costs, especially hourly labor, are a function of time. The more the\ndelays, the higher the costs. Furthermore, Union Pacific needed to spend large sums to hire and train an abnormally large number\nof new employees\u2014and also large sums to repair and maintain old locomotives that were brought out of retirement to meet the\n\nincreased demand.\n\f"}, "003657.png": {"text": "Investors became aware of the earnings shortfall during the first half of 2004. On the last trading day of 2003, the price of Union\nPacific\u2019s shares closed at $17.37.1 On June 30, 2004, the shares closed at $14.86, down 14.5 percent during the six-month period.\n\nDuring the same period, Burlington Northern Santa Fe\u2019s shares appreciated by 8.4 percent.\n\nIt seemed logical to us that Union Pacific\u2019s congestion problems could be and would be solved within a few years. New employees\ncould be hired and trained, new locomotives could be purchased, some trains could be rerouted away from congested lines, and\nnew track could be added in some of the more congested corridors. Decongestion should not be a difficult task. It also seemed\nlogical that the stronger market for rail traffic would lead to at least modest rate increases. We constructed an earnings model\n\nfor Union Pacific for the year 2006 that assumed that the railroad had solved most of its problems and had increased its rates\nmodestly. Based on these assumptions, our model projected that Union Pacific would earn close to $1.55 per share in 2006. By\ncomparison, we expected the railroad\u2019s 2004 earnings to be only about $0.70 per share. I decided to value Union Pacific\u2019s shares\nconservatively at 14 times earnings. Therefore, I estimated that the shares would be worth just over $22 in 2006. In addition, the\ncompany was paying a $0.30 annual dividend. Including the dividends, I concluded that the shares, which were selling at about\n$141 at the time, could provide a 55 percent total return over the two-year period 2004 to 2006. I decided to purchase the shares.\nThey did not appear to be a particularly exciting investment opportunity, but the stock market and our stocks had been strong\n\nin 2003, and we did not have alternatives that appeared to be more attractive. Furthermore, and importantly, I believed that the\nshares had very solid protection from material permanent loss. Their book value was $12. The company had a strong balance\nsheet for a railroad. And the company and Burlington Northern were a duopoly in the western half of the United States in an\n\nindustry that remained vital to the country.\n\nThere was another reason to own shares of Union Pacific rather than holding cash. Over a period of many decades, the stock\nmarket, as measured by the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index, has enjoyed an average annual total return of roughly 91/2 percent\n\u2014and our best guess was that returns could average somewhere around 91/2 percent over the next few decades.2 When we\n\npurchase a stock, we believe that it will appreciate by far more than the stock market appreciates. However, what if we are wrong\n\f"}, "003658.png": {"text": "and the stock appreciates only as much as the market? Then, if the stock is typical, it should earn an average annual return of about\n\n91/2 percent over time, which is much better than holding cash.\n\nInote that the 91/2 percent long-term upward bias of the stock market is one reason that shorting stocks generally is a bad\nbusiness. To do as well as a market that tends to provide a 91/2 percent annual return, a shorter of stocks must find stocks that\ndecline by at least 91/2 percent per year or that underperform the market by 19 percent. There are not many investors in the world\nwho can outperform the stock market by 19 percent per year, and thus I imagine that there are not many investors who can find\nstocks that will underperform the market by 19 percent. Furthermore, when an investor is long a stock, the most he can lose is his\noriginal investment\u2014and his upside profit potential is unlimited. When an investor is short a stock, his loss potential is unlimited\nif the stock happens to appreciate sharply, and his profit potential is only equal to the value of his original investment. Thus, I\nbelieve that shorting stocks generally is a miserable business, except for rare investors who have extraordinary abilities to predict\n\nwhen individual stocks or when markets will decline sharply.\n\nAnother reason for owning high-quality stocks is that they sometimes benefit from unanticipated surprises. That is why my old\nboss, Arthur Ross, continually advised me to purchase high-quality stocks and \u201cstay in the game, Ed, stay in the game\u201d (remember,\n\nArthur Ross usually said things twice when he wanted to make a point).\n\nIn the case of Union Pacific, we did materially benefit from an unanticipated surprise. The surprise had to do with the price of\ndiesel fuel. At the time we established our position in Union Pacific\u2019s shares, the price of diesel fuel was a hair over $1.50 per gallon.\nFor the next several years, diesel prices increased steadily and sharply, reaching a high of about $4.70 per gallon in 2008. Railroads\ntypically are three to four times more fuel efficient than trucks. Thus, to offset the higher fuel costs, trucking companies needed\nto increase their rates much more sharply than the railroads needed to. The sharply higher rates charged by trucking companies\nincentivized some shippers to switch from truck to rail. The increased demand for rail affected Union Pacific in two ways: (1)\n\nwith demand exceeding supply and with trucks less competitive, Union Pacific could materially increase its rates in excess of the\n\f"}, "003659.png": {"text": "amounts needed to offset the increased cost of fuel; and (2) the increase in traffic delayed the solution to the congestion problem\n\nbecause it increased the amount of capacity that Union Pacific needed to add.\n\nAfter purchasing our holding in Union Pacific, we constantly monitored the railroad\u2019s progress. From the onset, it appeared that\nthe company was receiving larger rate increases than we had projected, but that the congestion problems were stickier than\n\nwe had expected. When looking ahead, we believed that the large rate increases likely would continue and, sooner or later, the\ncompany would benefit from decongestion, and when that happened the company\u2019s earnings and share price should be buoyant.\n\u2018We were increasingly excited about our investment\u2014so excited that we also purchased shares of other railroads that also should\n\nbenefit from the anticipated large increases in rates.\n\n\u2018Wall Street generally did not agree with our excitement. On July 13, 2005, at a time when Union Pacific\u2019s shares were trading at\nabout $16, an analyst with J. P. Morgan downgraded the shares and recommended that they be underweighted\u2014which, in the\nlanguage of Wall Street, means that they should be sold. I was intrigued that, in spite of the bearish recommendation, the analyst\nwrote favorable comments about the company\u2019s longer-term potential. He wrote about Union Pacific\u2019s excellent route structure\nand advantageous access to customers. He added that these strengths should lead to solid margin, earnings, and cash flow\nperformance. However, the analyst was concerned that current capacity constraints and resulting operating inefficiencies would\nlead to short-term problems and continued disappointments that likely would take longer than a few more quarters to correct.\n\nSimply, the analyst could not wait much longer than a \u201cfew quarters\u201d for the operational turnaround. We could.\n\nBy mid-2007, it appeared that Union Pacific was beginning to materially benefit from decongestion. In the quarter that ended\n\non June 30, the company\u2019s average train speed was 21.6 miles per hour, up from 21.2 miles per hour during the comparable year-\nearlier quarter. Average dwell time (the average time a rail car spends in a terminal) was 24.7 hours in the June 2007 quarter, a\nlarge improvement from the 27.6 hours during the June 2006 quarter. The company\u2019s earnings in the first half of 2007 were up 19\n\npercent year-over-year, in spite of adverse flash floods in several states that caused track washouts and bridge outages.

Morgan analyst who in mid-2005 recommended that the shares be underweighted at $16 now\nwas recommending that the shares be purchased at $311/2. In a report dated July 17, 2006, the analyst wrote that Union Pacific\u2019s\npositive story was firmly intact, that the company had more pricing power than most other railroads, and that it had additional\nopportunities to improve its efficiencies. Ironically, the inefficiencies that were a reason not to purchase the shares in mid-2005\n\nwere a reason to purchase the shares in mid-2007. The analyst concluded that he saw meaningful upside potential for the shares.\n\nI meet regularly with my associates at Greenhaven to discuss our ideas and holdings. By mid-2007, it was becoming clear to us that\nmost other investors also believed that Union Pacific was benefiting from sizable rate increases and from operational efficiencies.\nTherefore, we concluded that a large percentage of Union Pacific\u2019s potential likely was being discounted into the price of the\nshares. Thus, at one of our regular meetings, we decided to start gradually selling our holding. By the end of 2007, we had sold\nmost of our shares at an average price of roughly $31. We had held the shares for an average of about 3.7 years. During that period,\nthe shares had slightly more than doubled, and we had earned $1.05 per share in dividends. Our average annualized return was\n\nclose to 24 percent, including the dividends we had received.\n\nThe J. P. Morgan analyst who recommended underweighting Union Pacific\u2019s shares at $16 was wrong. After the recommendation,\nthe price of the shares increased quite steadily through September 2008. My experience is that the recommendations of Wall\nStreet analysts are wrong more often than they are correct. An investor told me that he once had an account with one of Wall\nStreet\u2019s most respected firms. He told the Wall Street firm immediately to purchase any stock that was added to the firm\u2019s\noverweight list\u2014and immediately to sell the stock when it was removed from the list. After several years of following this\n\napproach, the investor closed his account with the most respected firm because his results were particularly poor.\n\f"}, "003661.png": {"text": "Why do analysts tend to be substandard stock pickers?

To have good judgment, you\nneed to have the knowledge, but, in my opinion, you also need many other qualities, including common sense, stable emotions,\n\nconfidence, and, quite possibly, an indefinable sixth sense.\n\nFurthermore, in my opinion, most individuals, including securities analysts, feel more comfortable projecting current\nfundamentals into the future than projecting changes that will occur in the future.

In 2000, the bubble burst\nand the stock market started to decline sharply. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which is laden with technology stocks, declined\nfrom a high of 5,048 on March 10, 2000, to a low of 1,114 on October 9, 2002\u2014a decline of 78 percent.

The magnitude of the collapse encouraged many investment committees and individual investors\nto seek investments that were less volatile than the stock market, and many committees and investors opted to invest in hedge\nfunds that promised to short stocks and thus to sharply reduce downside volatility. According to BarclayHedge, the assets under\n\nthe management of hedge funds increased from roughly $300 billion at the end of 2000 to more than $2 trillion by 2007.\n\nHedge funds typically charge their clients fees equal to 1 to 2 percent of the assets under management plus incentive fees of 20\npercent of any profits. In my opinion, given this very high fee structure, hedge funds are bent to making obscure investments\n\nas opposed to, for example, purchasing blue-chip stocks. It would be difficult for a hedge fund to justify its high fees if it heavily\nowned shares in Exxon, 3M, Berkshire Hathaway, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, or other heavily followed and commonly\nowned companies. By 2006, because hedge funds had become a large force in the stock market and because hedge funds generally\nhad shied away from blue-chip stocks, the shares of many of the largest and highest-quality companies were selling at relatively\n\ndepressed prices.\n\f"}, "003664.png": {"text": "In the meantime, during the period 2003 to 2005, Greenhaven\u2019s portfolios had benefited from the resurgence of the \u201cold economy\nstocks\u201d and had been abnormally buoyant.

Blue-chip stocks seemed to fit\n\nthe bill, and over a period of several quarters we purchased shares in GE, FedEx, 3M, and, unfortunately, AIG.\n\nAIG's predecessor company was founded in Shanghai in 1919 by Cornelius Vander Starr, who previously had owned an ice cream\nstore. For anumber of years, the company\u2019s main business was selling life insurance policies in China. In 1926, Starr opened an\noffice in New York City to offer casualty insurance to American companies conducting business abroad. After World War II, the\ncommunist government prohibited Starr\u2019s companies from doing business in China, but Starr more than compensated for the lost\nChinese business by aggressively expanding elsewhere. After Starr died in 1967, Maurice \u201cHank\u201d Greenberg became CEO of the\nseveral disparate insurance companies founded by Starr. Two of Greenberg's early actions were to merge the several companies\n\ninto a newly formed AIG, and then to take the new company public.\n\nOver the years, Hank Greenberg built AIG into a very large, highly profitable, and highly regarded \u201cgrowth\u201d company. During the\n15-year period 1989 to 2004, AIG\u2019s revenues and earnings both grew at a 14.1 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR), and\n\nthe company\u2019s share price increased at about a 17 percent CAGR. AIG was a winner.\n\nHowever, in 2004 and 2005, the company hit legal bumps when it was accused of several wrongdoings, including engaging in\nsham reinsurance transactions that were designed to bolster its reserves. Hank Greenberg was forced to resign in early 2005, and\nMartin Sullivan became the new CEO. Whereas the S&P 500 Index appreciated moderately between 2004 and 2006, AIG\u2019s shares\nremained flattish. In the spring of 2006, I reasoned that the 2004 and 2005 scandals had adversely affected the price of AIG\u2019s\nshares, that the shares were out of favor with hedge funds and other aggressive investors, and that, for these reasons, we now had.\n\nthe opportunity to purchase the shares at a materially undervalued price.\n\f"}, "003665.png": {"text": "I started analyzing AIG by reading the company\u2019s Form 10-K and annual report. There was nothing in the 10-K that surprised me.\nWhen reading the annual report, I realized that the reported earnings and balance sheets of any insurance company are no more\nthan estimates because managements, actuarial firms, and independent accountants must estimate the magnitude of recent and\nfuture losses\u2014and such estimates often are no more than educated guesses. However, AIG had taken a $1.82 billion pretax charge\nin late 2005 to increase its reserves, and my reasoning was that the new management had every incentive to take as large a charge\nas possible. After all, the new management could blame the old management for the charge, and a large charge now would lead\n\nto larger earnings in the future. Thus, the charge gave me some comfort that AIG\u2019s reserves now were accurately stated, if not\n\nconservatively stated.\n\nInsurance companies need to be financially strong, and in the annual report\u2019s letter to shareholders, management emphasized\nthat \u201cAIG remains among the most strongly capitalized organizations in our industry.\u201d AIG\u2019s credit ratings were the equivalent of\nAA, and management commented that \u201cat these levels, AIG\u2019s ratings are among the highest of any insurance and financial services\n\norganization in the world.\u201d\n\nI telephoned two friends who were CEOs of insurance companies. CEOs often do not like to praise their competitors, but both\n\nmy friends gave AIG rave reviews. In particular, both stated that AIG\u2019s size and capital strength gave the company a competitive\nadvantage. Medium-sized insurance companies often do not have sufficient capital and scope to meet the insurance needs of large,\ninternational Fortune 500 companies. Therefore, AIG sometimes faced limited competition on very large policies\u2014and limited\n\ncompetition often led to high premiums and high profits.\n\nOne of my CEO friends invited my wife and me to have dinner at his home with Martin Sullivan, AIG\u2019s new CEO. I leapt at the\nopportunity. Of course, one cannot judge the capabilities of a CEO from a three-hour social evening, but nonetheless, I found\n\nMartin Sullivan to be affable, knowledgeable, and highly intelligent.

My conclusion was that the company\u2019s normalized 2008\nEPS should be about $7 per share. The $7 would equal about a 15 percent return on a projected 2008 book value of about $46.50\nper share. The company seemed to earn a 15 percent return on book value in normal years, so the $7 EPS estimate appeared to be\n\nreasonable.\n\nNext, I valued AIG. Upon reflection, my best thinking was that AIG\u2019s shares were worth close to an average price-to-earnings\n(PE) ratio, or about 15 times earnings. Therefore, I concluded that, in 2008, AIG's shares would be worth roughly $105, or nearly\ntwice their existing price of about $55. Based on these numbers and the first-class reputation of the company, I started building a\n\nposition in the shares.\n\nThe year 2006 ended up to be good for AIG. EPS, before some unusual accounting adjustments for hedging, was a favorable $5.88.\nIn the fourth quarter of the year, management studied the company\u2019s capital position and concluded that the company was\novercapitalized by $15 to $20 billion. As a result of the study, in March 2007, management authorized the repurchase of $8 billion\n\nshares of the company\u2019s stock, and in May, management increased the company\u2019s dividend by 20 percent. I was smiling.\n\nToward the end of 2007, there was some general nervousness in the financial markets, and the price of AIG\u2019s shares slipped from\nabout $57 at the end of September to about $49 at the end of December. The shares continued to slip some in early 2008 and then\ndeclined sharply to a low of $33 when it appeared that Bear Stearns might declare bankruptcy. But the shares started to recover\n\nafter J.

The company did have to report losses from the\nmarking to market of a number of assets, including derivative contracts in its Financial Products subsidiary, which insured such\nfinancial risks as bank loans. The markdowns largely were necessitated by generally increasing yields on higher-risk assets, not\nby concerns that AIG\u2019s loss experiences materially would deteriorate. Therefore, our reasoning was that, when the derivative\ncontracts matured, most or all of the losses would be reversed. In Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s 2007 annual report, Warren Buffett had\ncomplained about the need to mark derivative contracts to market: \u201cChanges in the value of a derivative contract ... must be\napplied each quarter to earnings. Thus, our derivative positions will sometimes cause large swings in reported earnings, even\nthough Charlie (Munger) and I might believe the intrinsic value of these positions has changed little. He and I will not be bothered\nby these swings. ... And we hope you won't either.\u201d Further, we reasoned that, if the credit rating companies or the regulators were\nconcerned about the write-downs, AIG could always raise cash and capital by selling new common shares, preferred shares, or\nsubordinated debt. Indeed, on May 8, AIG announced that it would raise about $20 billion of new capital through the sale of new\n\ncommon shares and subordinated debentures.\n\nHowever, the nervousness continued, and during June and July 2008, AIG\u2019s shares generally sold between $20 and $25. In mid-\nAugust, I noticed that a key director of AIG, who at the time chaired the board\u2019s finance committee and who had previously chaired\nthe audit committee, had purchased 30,000 AIG\u2019s shares for his own account on August 12. These purchases gave me considerable\ncomfort.

In the wake of the collapse of Lehman and the near freezing of the financial markets, the price of AIG's\nshares fell sharply. The company needed a large influx of cash to post as collateral, but with the markets close to frozen, the cash\ncould not be raised. On Tuesday night, September 16, the U.S. government agreed to provide the requisite cash in return for a\nlion\u2019s share of the ownership of AIG. As soon as I read the agreement, it was clear to me that we had a large permanent loss in our\nholdings in AIG.\n\nThe failing of Lehman and the resulting severe financial crisis were outlier events that had not been part of our thinking or\nplanning. Over the next few weeks, I worked long hours trying to get a handle on what was happening. It was difficult to think\nclearly and unemotionally in the midst of the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression. Given the dangers and\nuncertainties, we had to act. Within several weeks of the failure of Lehman, we sold the bulk of our holdings in financial service\ncompanies and we sold several stocks that had not declined sharply and, therefore, that had become less attractive relative to the\n\nstock market in general. These actions increased our cash holdings to about 40 percent of the value of our portfolios.\n\nDuring the next few months, we thought long and hard about the economic environment and about our portfolios. It soon became\nclear to me that our nation faced two interrelated, yet disparate, problems: (1) the financial crisis and (2) a deep recession. I decided\nthat, as long as the financial crisis continued, we would hold on to our large holdings of cash. I was fearful that, if the crisis did not\nend, the deep recession could turn into another Great Depression. However, I reasoned that if the crisis ended, the opportunity\n\nto reinvest the cash in abnormally undervalued common stocks likely would be compelling. In my opinion, many corporations\nhad sharply reduced their inventory levels during the financial crisis in order to raise cash, and these inventory reductions were a\nmajor cause of the recession. Once the crisis ended, corporations likely would replenish at least some of their inventories\u2014and the\nreplenishment would be a stimulant to the overall economy. Furthermore, during the crisis many individuals and corporations\n\ndeferred purchasing large-ticket items that they had either needed or wanted.

Also, by late 2008, it was clear to me that the U.S. government and\nthe Federal Reserve Bank would take aggressive actions to stimulate the economy. Thus, I concluded that, once the financial crisis\n\nended, there would be a high probability that the economy would bounce back some, maybe sharply.\n\nIn late 2008 and early 2009, we carefully monitored the interest rate spreads between U.S. treasuries and lesser quality debt\ninstruments\u2014and we also searched for other signs that the financial crisis was continuing or was abating. By March, interest rate\nspreads had narrowed and substantial confidence had returned to the financial system, and I decided to reinvest the cash in our\nportfolios. Between the end of 2007 and March 31, 2009, while the S&P 500 Index had declined by about 45 percent, the subsector\nof the Index that was composed of industrial companies had declined by about 54 percent. Industrial companies are more\neconomically sensitive than most other types of companies (such as consumer durables, pharmaceuticals, and utilities), so it is\nnot surprising that industrial stocks declined by more than the market as a whole. When purchasing stocks in the spring of 2009,\nwe mainly purchased shares of industrial companies. They not only were more depressed than most other sectors of the market,\nbut also they would more directly benefit from a bounce-back of the economy. Our strategy succeeded. A typical Greenhaven\nportfolio, after losing about 38 percent of its value in the disastrous year 2008, appreciated by roughly 47 percent in 2009 and 21\npercent in 2010. By the end of 2010, the value of a typical Greenhaven portfolio was close to 10 percent higher than at the end of\n2007.\n\nAIG had been a disaster for Greenhaven but not for the U.S. government. After the crisis, AIG skinnied down and enjoyed good\noperating earnings. The U.S. government benefited from the recovery in AIG\u2019s fortunes and gradually reduced its investment in the\ncompany, selling the last of its holdings on December 11, 2012. According to the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank and the\n\nU.S. Treasury together earned a $22.7 billion profit on its \u201cinvestment\u201d in AIG.\n\nSome criticize the U.S. government for bailing out financial institutions during the financial crisis.

The bailouts were a pragmatic partial solution to a very serious problem.\nMany idealists took the position that, in principle, the government never should bail out private enterprises. I believe that humans\nand institutions need to be pragmatic and flexible and that strong ideologies and tunnel visions can lead to failures that end up\n\nhurting people.\n\nA few weeks after the collapse of AIG\u2019s shares, a friend and client asked me if I had learned anything from the horribly failed\ninvestment. I told him that we were still in the fog of war and that I would have a clearer picture of our mistake after the financial\ncrisis ended. Months later, I did reflect on the investment. I reviewed the work we had performed and the information we had\nlearned, both of which were extensive. I then asked myself the question: if I had to make the purchase decision today based on\nwhat we knew then, would I still make the same decision to purchase the shares? My answer was \u201cyes\u201d\u2014and my conclusion was\nthat, in the investment business, relatively unpredictable outlier developments sometimes can quickly derail otherwise attractive\ninvestments. It comes with the territory. So while we work hard to reduce the risks of large permanent loss, we cannot completely\neliminate large risks. However, we can draw a line on how much risk we are willing to accept\u2014a line that provides sufficient\napparent protection and yet prevents us from being so risk averse that we turn down too many attractive opportunities. One\n\nshould not invest with the precept that the next 100-year storm is around the corner.\n\nLuckily, in practice, usually we become aware of adverse changes sufficiently early that we can sell shares before any loss becomes\ntoo large.

The\n\ncompany\u2019s sales volumes closely track with the strength of the housing industry.\n\nLowe\u2019s was founded in 1921 when Lucius S. Lowe opened a hardware store in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina. After Lucius\nLowe died in 1940, the store was owned and operated by several family members, and especially by Carl Buchan, a son-in-\n\nlaw. In the 1950s, Buchan opened several new stores that sold building supplies as well as hardware. Buchan died suddenly in\n1960. Robert Strickland, the new CEO, took the company public in 1961 and continued to expand its footprint. Lowe\u2019s revenues\n\nincreased from $25 million in 1960, to more than $150 million in 1970, and to nearly $900 million in 1980.\n\nHistorically, Lowe\u2019s had concentrated on selling to the professional builder. But when the market for new houses weakened in\n1980, the company started redesigning its stores to appeal to the do-it-yourself homeowner. At about that time, a new competitor,\nThe Home Depot, started opening big-box warehouse stores that typically were five times larger than the stores operated by\nLowe\u2019s. By 1989, it was clear that Home Depot's large store format was the way of the future. Lowe\u2019s took an impairment charge in\n1991 to close smaller stores\u2014and management then started aggressively opening big-box stores to compete with Home Depot. In\n1993 alone, Lowe\u2019s nearly doubled its floor space by opening 57 new stores, each averaging close to 100,000 square feet in size.

Small stores simply could not compete\nwith the purchasing powers, distribution efficiencies, merchandise varieties, efficiencies of scale, and low real estate costs enjoyed\n\nby the two big-box retailers.\n\nLowe\u2019s prospered during the 2001-2005 period. The company not only benefited from the boom in housing, but also from taking\nmarket share from Home Depot, which was suffering from some self-inflicted merchandising problems. During the five-year\nperiod that ended on January 31, 2006, Lowe's sales per store (comps) increased at a 5.4 percent average annual rate, while Home\nDepot\u2019s comps only increased at a 2.5 percent average rate. Lowe\u2019s was flying high. The company\u2019s earnings climbed from $0.53\nper share in 2000 to $1.73 per share in 2005.

In the three-year period 2007 to 2009, Lowe\u2019s comps declined by an aggregate of 17.8\npercent\u2014a near disaster. Earnings, leveraged downward by the weak sales, fell by 39 percent, from $1.99 per share in 2006 to\n$1.21 in 2009, and earnings would have declined further if management had not taken strong steps to reduce costs.

I was intrigued by the depressed prices and by the logic that the housing industry eventually had to recover strongly.\nTherefore, I decided to conduct my own study of the market. My conclusion was that the market could turn surprisingly strong\n\nwithin the next several years. My logic and methodology were as follows.\n\nFirst, I estimated how many new housing units were required each year to satisfy normal demand. Normal demand is equal to the\nnet increase in the number of families in the United States, plus the number of houses torn down each year, plus the increase in the\n\nnumber of vacation and other second homes.\n\nIn 2011, there were about 131 million housing units in the United States. Between 2000 and 2010 the population of the United\nStates increased at a 0.92 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 282.16 million to 309.33 million. I reasoned that if\nthe population continued to increase at a 0.92 percent CAGR, there would be a need for about 1,200,000 additional housing units\nper year (131 million times 0.92 percent). I also read a lengthy report issued in September 2010 by Harvard University\u2019s Joint\nCenter for Housing Studies that predicted that net family formations during the decade 2010 to 2020 would be in the range of\n1,180,000 to 1,280,000 per year. After reading a few other studies, I decided to estimate that at least 1,200,000 new housing units\nwould be required in a normal year to meet the annual net increase in family formations plus the increase in demand for second\nhomes. I also estimated that about 300,000 additional new housing units would be required annually to replace houses that were\ndemolished because of age, fire, flood, location, and so on. Therefore, I concluded that at least 1,500,000 new housing units were\n\nneeded in a normal year.\n\nBefore conducting further analysis, I decided to check my 1,500,000 estimate against historical data. In the 20-year period 1980\nto 1999, the average annual number of housing units completed in the United States was 1,430,000. The population of the\nUnited States during the 20-year period averaged about 250 million. Adjusted to the 2011 population of 311 million, 1,430,000\ncompletions would be the equivalent of about 1,780,000 units in 2011. Looking at a more recent period, annual housing\n\ncompletions during four years, 2000 through 2003, averaged about 1,620,000, in spite of the adverse effects of 9/11 and the mild\n\f"}, "003675.png": {"text": "recession. These data gave me confidence that, even if demographics were somewhat less favorable post the financial crisis, my\n\n1,500,000 estimate for normal demand was reasonable, if not conservative.\n\nThe number of new housing units built in 2010 in the United States was only 650,000, and it appeared that the number would\ndecline to below 600,000 in 2011, or at a depression level of only 40 percent of estimated normal demand. Construction could\nnot remain at 40 percent of normal demand forever. People have to live somewhere. It was clear to me that the housing market\nwould recover and that the recovery would be very strong, with housing completions eventually increasing 2.5-fold to about the\n\n1,500,000 level. The remaining unknown was the timing of the recovery.\n\nTo estimate the possible timing of the recovery, I used Census Bureau data on housing completions to calculate that, if the normal\nannual demand for new housing is 1,500,000 units, then 1,400,000 excess houses were built during the boom years 2004 through\n2007. Another consideration was the effect of foreclosures on the housing market, a consideration that seemed to befuddle\n\nmany Wall Street analysts. When thinking about foreclosures, I adopted the following approach. When a house is foreclosed,\n\nthe foreclosure adds to the inventory overhang only if the former occupant moves in with another family (typically a parent or a\nfriend), as opposed to purchasing another house or leasing a rental unit. Thus, if I were able to estimate the increase in \u201cdoubled-\nup\u201d households, I would know the number of house vacancies that were created by the foreclosures or by the loss of jobs. Such\nfigures were available. The number of doubled-up families had increased by about 2 million during the years 2008 through 2010\n\nand seemed to have stabilized at that level.\n\nTherefore, before consideration of the recent underbuilding of housing units, I concluded that the overbuilding in the 2004-2007\nperiod and the foreclosures in the 2008-2010 period increased the inventory of vacant homes by about 3,400,000 housing units\n(1,400,000 from overbuilding during 2004-2007 plus the 2 million vacated because of foreclosures). Again using Census Bureau\ndata, I then calculated that the underbuilding during the years 2008 through 2010 totaled 1,900,000 units (vs. the normal annual\n\nneed of 1,500,000 new units) and therefore that, during the entire 2003-2010 period, the inventory of vacant homes increased\n\f"}, "003676.png": {"text": "by 1,500,000 units. Since housing inventories at the end of 2003 seemed to be at normal levels, I concluded that the estimated\ninventory overhang at the end of 2010 was approximately 1,500,000 units. In 2011, only about 600,000 new housing units were\nbeing built. If construction continued at the 600,000 level and if normal demand was 1,500,000, the housing industry would be in\n\nbalance by late 2012, assuming that the number of doubled-up families had stabilized, which seemed to be the case.\n\nI was excited that we had a concept about a probable strong upturn in the housing market that was not shared by most others. I\nbelieved that the existing negativism about housing was due to the proclivity of human beings to uncritically project recent trends\ninto the future and to overly dwell on existing problems. When analyzing companies and industries, I tend to be an optimist by\nnature and a pragmatist through effort. In terms of the proverbial glass of water, it is never half empty, but always half full\u2014and,\n\nas a pragmatist, it is twice as large as it needs to be.\n\nAfter I became enthusiastic about an upturn in the housing market, I started looking for investments that would benefit from the\nimprovement. My first instinct was to study the publicly owned homebuilders. However, their balance sheets were not strong, and\nI was concerned about risks of insolvency if the housing market did not improve over the next few years. I continually attempt\n\nto minimize risks of permanent loss and continually am mindful of Warren Buffett\u2019s two rules for successful inventing: \u201cRule\n\nnumber one is never lose money; rule number two is never forget rule number one.\u201d\n\nMy second instinct was to study the home improvement retailers, and I soon became excited about Lowe\u2019s, largely because I\nbelieved that the company would benefit from two positive changes: (1) the upturn in the housing market and (2) improved\nmerchandising. During the years 2001 to 2005, when Home Depot was suffering from merchandising problems and when Lowe\u2019s\nwas gaining market share, Lowe\u2019s apparently became complacent and let its merchandising slip. The company now needed to\nstudy each product it sold and eliminate poorly selling products, introduce new exciting products, obtain lower prices from its\nsuppliers, optimize the prices it charged its customers, find the optimum selling space for each product, adjust inventory levels to\n\nminimize stock-outs and the need for markdowns, and modernize advertising and signage. Lowe\u2019s management seemed serious\n\f"}, "003677.png": {"text": "about improving the company\u2019s merchandising. I reasoned that the improvements required attention and effort, not rocket\n\nscience, and that there was a high probability that substantial progress could be made within two to three years.\n\nAfter studying Lowe\u2019s financials and other fundamentals, I constructed a model of normalized 2014 earnings. My model assumed.\nthat the housing industry recovered and that the company\u2019s merchandising materially improved. First, I estimated what revenues\nmight be in 2014. In 2011, Lowe's stores contained a total of 197 million square feet of selling space. The company was projecting\nthat its selling space would increase at a 1 percent annual rate. Consequently, I projected that its selling space in 2014 would\n\ntotal 203 million square feet. The company\u2019s sales per square foot in 2010 were $250, down from $302 in 2003. I believed that\nthe company\u2019s revenues in 2003 were at a normal level. Therefore, I assumed that sales per square foot would return to the $302\nlevel, before adjusting for subsequent inflation, and to $337 assuming that the inflation rate between 2003 and 2014 averaged 1\npercent.2 Thus, I projected that Lowe\u2019s normalized revenues in 2014 could be $337 per square foot times 203 million square feet,\n\nor $68.4 billion.\n\nNext, I projected operating profit margins. The company\u2019s margins in 2003 were 10.5 percent before nonrecurring costs to open\nnew stores. I saw no reason why the company\u2019s margins could not return to the 10.5 percent level by 2014 if the housing industry\n\nrecovered and if the company\u2019s merchandizing improved sufficiently.\n\nOperating margins of 10.5 percent on $68.4 billion of sales would produce $7,180 million of operating profit. To calculate after-\ntax earnings, I subtracted projected interest expense of $275 million and taxes at a 38 percent rate. To then calculate earnings per\nshare (EPS), I divided projected after-tax earnings by the 1.4 billion shares that were outstanding. My conclusion was that normal\n\nEPS in 2014 could be a bit over $3.\n\nFinally, I valued the shares. There was a lot to like about Lowe\u2019s. It had a strong balance sheet. It was generating large amounts of\nexcess cash. It essentially was a duopoly. It enjoyed a favorable reputation. However, Home Depot and Lowe's had saturated the\n\nUnited States with stores, and therefore, once housing recovered, Lowe\u2019s future growth likely would be relatively slow. On balance,\n\f"}, "003678.png": {"text": "I decided to value Lowe's at 16 times earnings, which is slightly above the average historical price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of the\nstock market. Therefore, I believed that Lowe's shares in 2014 would be worth slightly in excess of $48. The shares at the time were\ntrading at about $24. They appeared to be a bargain. I started purchasing the shares and over the next several months built a large\n\nholding.\n\nOn December 7, 2011, Lowe\u2019s management held a meeting for analysts and shareholders. At the meeting, the company disclosed\nits \u201croad map\u201d projections for 2015. Importantly, the projections assumed that housing prices only increased modestly by 2015\nand that housing completions only reached the 900,000 to 1 million level. The company\u2019s road map estimated that revenues\nwould increase at a 4.5 percent average annual rate to $58.7 billion in 2015 and that operating profit margins would increase to 10\n\npercent.\n\nThe road map also projected that Lowe\u2019s would repurchase $18 billion of its shares over the four year period 2012 to 2015. The $18\nbillion was a mind-boggling surprise. The entire market value of the company at the time was only $35 billion, so the company\nwas planning to repurchase 51 percent of its existing market value over the next four years. The company projected that the\nrepurchases would reduce the number of shares outstanding from about 1,400 million to 900 million. The extremely aggressive\nrepurchase program would materially increase Lowe\u2019s earnings per share. It also was a strong signal of management's confidence\n\nin the company\u2019s future as well as its interest in the price of Lowe\u2019s shares.\n\nHow could the company afford to repurchase $18 billion of its shares? There were several considerations. Earnings would increase\nsharply. Capital expenditures would trail depreciation by an aggregate of $1 billion because the company did not intend to open\nmany new stores. New computer systems and the new merchandizing programs would reduce the company\u2019s investment in\ninventories by $1 billion. Also, the company would generate close to $7 billion of cash by increasing its debt. Management believed\nthat the company\u2019s balance sheet was underleveraged and that the increased debt could be supported by cash flows and asset\n\nvalues.\n\f"}, "003679.png": {"text": "After the December 7 meeting, I revised my earnings model. I revise models frequently because my initial models rarely are close\nto being accurate. Usually, they are no better than directional. But they usually do lead me in the right direction, and, importantly,\nthe process of constructing a model forces me to consider and weigh the central fundamentals of a company that will determine\n\nthe company\u2019s future value.\n\nMy revised model focused on projected results for the year 2015. Management was projecting 4.5 percent average annual revenues\ngrowth without a major recovery in housing. After thinking and making some submodels, I projected that average annual revenue\ngrowth could be 6.5 percent assuming that the housing recovery was quite, but not very, strong. If the annual growth rate were 6.5\n\npercent, revenues in 2015 would be about $64 billion.\n\nIhad a problem determining the operating profit margin I should use in the revised model. Management had stated that each $1\nof incremental revenues would increase operating profits by about $0.20. Based on my knowledge of the company, the 20 percent\nincremental made sense. Given a 20 percent incremental, if Lowe\u2019s revenues increased for four years at 6.5 percent per year instead\nof the road map\u2019s 4.5 percent per year, then the company\u2019s projected operating margin in 2015 would be 1.6 percent above the road\nmap\u2019s 10 percent (20 percent of 2 percent for four years). However, the company\u2019s margins had never been as high as 11.6 percent\n\nbefore, and my instincts guided me to a more conservative estimate. I settled for 10.5 percent.\n\nContinuing with the revised model, if revenues were $64 billion, operating margins were 10.5 percent, interest expenses were\n$650 million (higher than my previous model\u2019s $275 million because the company planned to increase its debt by close to $7\nbillion), income taxes were at a 38 percent rate, and the number of shares outstanding were 920 million, EPS would be $4.10.\nWe had paid only about $24 for the shares. If 2015 earnings were close to $4.10, the shares should be a complete winner, and if\nwe were too optimistic and earnings were only at the $3 level, the shares still should be an attractive investment.

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of housing starts, which had remained in the range of 700,000 to\n750,000 during the first half of 2012, increased to 854,000 in September and to 983,000 in December.

After researching a few dozen other\ncompanies, we purchased a medium-sized position in Whirlpool Corporation and small positions in The Home Depot, Lennox\nInternational (a manufacturer of air conditioners and furnaces), and Mohawk Industries (a manufacturer of carpets and other\nflooring materials). Why was Lowe\u2019s our number one pick and our largest position? Simply, Lowe\u2019s appeared to be materially\n\nmore undervalued than Home Depot and the other larger capitalization stocks we researched. Home Depot had made a number of\nexcellent merchandising decisions and was operating on eight cylinders. Lowe\u2019s was sputtering some, and the price of its shares\nreflected the sputtering. In 2011, Lowe\u2019s had revenues of $50 billion and a market value (the price of shares times the number\n\nof shares outstanding) of only about $24 billion. Therefore, an investor received about $2.08 of revenues for each $1 of market\nvalue. Home Depot had revenues of roughly $70 billion and a market value of $56 billion.

Investors generally had opted for the cleaner and clearer fundamentals. Lowe\u2019s merchandising problems\nwere an uncertainty\u2014and many investors shy away from uncertainties. The price of Home Depot\u2019s, Lennox\u2019s, and Mohawk\u2019s shares\n\ncontinued to climb sharply in early 2013, and we then sold the shares for roughly twice what we paid for them.\n\nOf our five housing-related investments, Whirlpool was my second favorite. The company\u2019s shares were selling at a depressed\nprice because the company\u2019s earnings had been under pressure from sharply increased costs for steel and other raw materials and\nfrom weak demand for appliances. We reasoned that there was a high probability that the cost of raw materials would stabilize\n\nor decline and that the demand for appliances would increase sharply as the housing market recovered. We projected that the\ncompany could earn roughly $20 per share five years hence and that the shares could then be worth $250 to $300. The shares were\n\ntrading at about $80 at the time we performed our analysis. Thus, if all went well, the shares would be a superb investment.\n\nWhirlpool was founded in 1911 by Lou Upton as the Upton Machine Company. Until that time, clothes washing machines\n\nwere wooden tubs. Housewives filled the tubs with clothes, water, and soap and then scrubbed the clothes by hand. Upton\nadded an electric motor to the tub. Almost immediately, Upton received an order for 100 of his newfangled washing machines\nfrom a company named Federal Electric. However, a problem soon arose when a cast-iron gear broke in many of the machines.\nUpton quickly replaced the defective part with a new gear made from steel. The problem was solved, and Federal Electric was so\n\nimpressed by Upton\u2019s speedy reaction and business ethics that it ordered an additional 100 machines. A company was born.\n\nIn 1929, Upton merged his company into the Nineteen Hundred Washer Company of New York, which evidently was an\n\ninnovative company in spite of its totally uninnovative and awkward name. After producing airplane parts during World War\n\f"}, "003685.png": {"text": "II, the Nineteen Hundred Washer Company, anticipating a large postwar demand for home appliances, successfully introduced\n\na broader line of appliances. In 1949, the company\u2019s management demonstrated infinite wisdom by changing the name of the\ncompany to Whirlpool. At the time of the name change, Whirlpool\u2019s revenues were $48 million. Over the next 50 years, Whirlpool\ncontinued to aggressively introduce new products and acquire other companies. By 1999, the company\u2019s revenues had reached\n\n$10,511 million, a 219-fold increase versus 1949.\n\nI find that the following data are both interesting and important. Whirlpool\u2019s growth in revenues from $48 million in 1949 to\n$10,511 million in 1999 seems huge, but actually equates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of only 11.4 percent. This\nmeans that if the company\u2019s profit margins and price-to-earnings (PE) ratio remained flat during the 50-year period, an investor\u2019s\naverage annual return during the 50-year period would have been only 11.4 percent, plus dividends that were received. Since\nGreenhaven strives for annual returns of 15 to 20 percent, if we had owned Whirlpool for the 50-year interval, the investment\n\nwould have been subpar, in spite of the 219-fold increase in revenues.\n\nIn the 1950s, the appliance industry was a growth industry, as many homeowners purchased dishwashers, freezers, and clothes\ndryers for the first time. During the 12-year period 1949 to 1961, Whirlpool\u2019s revenues grew from $48 million to $437 million,\nwhich is equal to a CAGR of 20.2 percent. During the next 38 years, the appliance industry matured and slowed, and Whirlpool\u2019s\ngrowth slowed to an 8.7 percent average annual rate. I believe that there is an important lesson in this. Over time, the growth rates\nof almost all technologies, products, and services slow because of saturation, obsolescence, or competition. Many investors tend\nto project high growth rates far into the future without fully considering forces that eventually will lead to slower growth. In the\nlate 1960s and early 1970s, it became fashionable among many investors to purchase growth stocks with the intention of holding\nthe stocks forever. These investors focused on about 50 stocks that appeared to have superior growth characteristics. Due to the\npopularity of the stocks, their prices rose substantially, and they sold at historically high PE ratios. The growth stock investors\nmade the argument that the high PE ratios were neither a relevancy nor a risk, and therefore should be ignored. Their logic was\n\nthat if a company was growing at a 20 percent rate and if the company\u2019s stock was going to be held for many decades, the investor\n\f"}, "003686.png": {"text": "would earn a high return even if the PE ratio declined materially over the decades.

The 50 favored growth stocks became so popular with\n\nso many investors that they even were blessed with a nickname: the Nifty-Fifty. As a result of their popularity, the Nifty-Fifty\neventually started selling at excessive PE ratios. According to Fortune magazine, in December 1972, the average PE ratio of the\nNifty-Fifty growth stocks was 42 times. Coca-Cola sold at 46 times earnings, IBM at 35 times, Johnson & Johnson at 57 times, 3M at\n\n39 times, Merck at 43 times, and Xerox at 46 times.\n\nAs it turned out, the Nifty-Fifty were not so nifty after all. The growth of most of the 50 slowed to normal or below-normal rates\nover the years. Worse, many of the companies developed serious problems. Two of the companies (Kodak and Polaroid) eventually\nfiled for bankruptcy. A number of the other companies (including Digital Equipment and S. S. Kresge) ran into difficulties and were\nsold to larger companies at relatively low prices. It may be difficult to believe, but Citicorp (then named First National City Bank)\n\nwas one of the Nifty-Fifty, as were J.C. Penney and Sears Roebuck.\n\nAt one time, the Nifty-Fifty were called one-decision stocks: a decision was made to purchase the stocks, and because the stocks\nwould be held forever, no decision ever was required to sell them. Well, unfortunately for the advocates of the one-decision growth\nstocks, painful second decisions were required in 1973 when the prices of the Nifty-Fifty stocks started to tumble. From their\n1973-1974 highs to their 1974 lows, the price of Xerox\u2019s shares declined by 71 percent, Avon\u2019s by 86 percent, and Polaroid\u2019s by 91\n\npercent.

For the prior approximately 200,000 years, they were hunter-gatherers who traveled in\nbands in search of food and shelter. To be successful, bands normally could have only one leader. If there were more than one\nleader in a band, dissension likely would develop over decision making, and the stronger leader eventually would eliminate\n\nthe weaker ones. Leaders tend to seek absolute power and sometimes will murder rivals or potential rivals in order to protect\ntheir position. History books tell of kings who murdered their siblings, or even their children, in order to eliminate the threat of\ncompetition. Thus, over tens of thousands of years, many humans with leadership genes were eliminated by survival of the fittest,\n\nleaving the vast majority of hunter-gatherers as followers. Scientists say that the genetic composition of present humans is almost\n\f"}, "003688.png": {"text": "identical to the genetic composition of hunter-gatherers. Therefore, only a minority of present humans have the leadership gene,\n\nand most humans tend to be followers.\n\nAcorollary thesis explains why so many investors are too focused on short-term fundamentals and investment returns at the\nexpense of longer-term fundamentals and returns. Hunter-gatherers needed to be greatly concerned about their immediate\nsurvival\u2014about a pride of lions that might be lurking behind the next rock or about the vicinity of a neighboring enemy tribe that\nmight attack and kill. They did not have the luxury of thinking about longer-term planning. Through the selection process, many\nof those that did not possess the ability to react to immediate dangers did not survive. Then and today, humans often flinch when\nthey come upon a sudden apparent danger\u2014and, by definition, a flinch is instinctive as opposed to cognitive. Thus, over years,\nthe selection process resulted in a subconscious proclivity for humans to be more concerned about the short term than the longer\n\nterm.\n\nI note that others also have come to the conclusion that much of human economic behavior is genetic. Notably, Daniel Kahneman\nwon a Nobel Prize in 2002 for his work on prospect theory, which concludes that people often are prone to make irrational\ndecisions that are based on inherited intuitions as opposed to logical conclusions. Kahneman and others invented a new branch of\n\nscience called behavioral economics that studies the influence of human behavior on economic decision making.\n\nLate in the 1998-2000 Internet boom, I received telephone calls from two clients who tended to be followers and who were overly\nfocused on the short term. The first call was from Dick Albright, an intelligent older man who had sold his business and who now\npassionately collected antique Chinese furniture, especially furniture made from huanghuali wood. At the time Dick called, our\nstocks were doing fine, but not nearly as fine as Internet-related stocks. Dick mentioned that his son, who most unfortunately had\nlost his regular job and now was day-trading Internet stocks from a computer in his apartment, was materially outperforming\nGreenhaven. Dick strongly suggested that I test the waters by purchasing a few Internet stocks: \u201cJust buy two or three to broaden\n\nyour knowledge, because if you don\u2019t learn something about the New Economy, you may lose your relevance as an investment\n\f"}, "003689.png": {"text": "manager. Maybe my son can give you some ideas; maybe you can learn something from him about investing in the New Economy.\nHere is his telephone number. You really should call him; he is in his 20s and he really understands digital technology.\u201d I did not\n\ncall him, and I did not purchase any of the overpriced Internet stocks.\n\nThe second call was from Frank Heat, a retired Goldman Sachs investment banking partner. Frank simply could not understand\nhow Greenhaven managed to completely miss the Internet boom. \u201cWhere were you? Were you asleep?\u201d I carefully explained what\nInormally explain to clients: that we are value investors who seek margins of safety in value stocks\u2014and that there are risks of\n\nobsolescence in high-technology stocks that do not give us the margin of safety that we cherish.\n\nBoth clients called me several additional times with the same complaints. Finally, I successfully convinced Dick that he should\nseek another investment manager (maybe his otherwise unemployed son), and Frank left on his own accord. Of course, soon after\nthe two clients departed (presumably for investment managers who were heavily invested in excessively priced New Economy\n\nInternet stocks), the bubble abruptly burst, with many technology stocks losing more than three-quarters of their market value.\n\nDuring the 1997-2000 boom period for technology stocks, a typical Greenhaven account\u2019s average annual return was 18.5\npercent. The Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) 500 Index\u2019s average annual return during the period was 22.4 percent (the Index was heavily\nweighted with technology stocks). We lagged. Near the end of the boom, I was happy to lag. I told my associates that if the S&P 500\nIndex continued to increase sharply due to the further appreciation of materially overvalued Internet-related stocks, I wanted to\nlag the Index. The only way we could outperform an already overvalued index was to take risks that would be unwise, unsound,\n\nand irresponsible.\n\nThen, during the sharp market decline of 2001 and 2002, Greenhaven\u2019s average annual return was a positive 3.4 percent, while the\nS&P 500\u2019s was a negative 18.2 percent. Internet and many other New Economy technology stocks were dumped by investors. Our\n\nstocks generally held their own, in spite of the strong headwind of a declining stock market.\n\f"}, "003690.png": {"text": "Every once in a while, the stars align for an investment manager. Such was the case in 2003 to 2005. In early 2003, the \u201cOld\nEconomy\u201d stocks we owned were selling at undeservedly depressed prices. They had been underowned during the Internet\nboom. Furthermore, we had an exciting opportunity to purchase shares of companies that produce commodities. In the early\n2000s, China and a number of other emerging countries markedly increased the quantities of crude oil, steel, copper, and other\ncommodities they were purchasing to meet the needs of their growing economies. Demand started to exceed supply for many\ncommodities, and their prices started to rise sharply. Greenhaven noticed this and purchased shares of companies that produce\noil, fertilizer, and paper. We were in the right place at the right time, and during the three-year period 2003 through 2005, our\n\naverage annual return was 34 percent, far above the S&P 500\u2019s 12.8 percent.\n\nI sometimes wonder how Dick Albright\u2019s and Frank Heat\u2019s portfolios fared during the 2000-2005 period. Probably quite poorly.\n\nPatience, steady emotions, and common sense all are important attributes when investing in common stocks.\n\nThe sharp increase in commodity prices between 2003 and 2008 helped create an opportunity for us to purchase Whirlpool\u2019s\nshares in 2011 at a particularly and undeservedly depressed price. The years 2003 through 2011 were an absolutely hellish period\nfor Whirlpool. From 2003 to 2011 the price of steel, copper, and plastics (the key raw materials used to manufacture appliances)\nincreased sharply. The price of copper increased from an average of $0.81 per pound in 2003 to about $4 per pound in 2011.\nDuring the same eight-year period, the typical domestic price of hot rolled steel increased from about $270 per ton to about $650\nper ton. Between 2003 and 2011, Whirlpool\u2019s annual raw materials costs increased by about $3.5 billion, or by about 18 percent of\nrevenues. What a headwind! Actually, what a storm! Moreover, after the housing market started to weaken in 2007, the demand\nfor large appliances fell sharply. According to the Association of Home Appliance Manufactures, U.S. industry sales of the \u201cbig\n\n6\u201d appliances (washers, dryers, refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers, and ranges) declined from about 47 million units in 2006 to\nabout 36 million in 2011. In an environment of weak demand, Whirlpool had difficulties increasing prices sufficiently to offset its\nincreased costs for raw materials. Thus, Whirlpool simultaneously suffered from increased raw material costs, reduced sales, and\n\npressured pricing. Not a happy situation.\n\f"}, "003691.png": {"text": "Amazingly, Whirlpool remained profitable during the entire 2003-2011 period in spite of the hurricane-force headwinds. To the\ncredit of management (especially Jeff Fettig, who had become CEO in 2004), the company aggressively and continually reduced\nits costs during the period. Products were redesigned to reduce the use of raw materials and to increase the commonality of parts,\nplants were consolidated and relocated to low-cost geographies, employee benefits were reduced, and advertising and other\noverhead expenditures were curtailed. In Whirlpool\u2019s 2008 annual report, management listed three strategic priorities. The first\n\npriority on the list was to \u201creduce our global cost structure\u201d:\n\nWe are taking aggressive action to redesign our products with global standards for parts and components. This proven\n\nglobal approach lowers costs, improves quality, and speeds our time from design to market. The difficult decision to close five\nmanufacturing facilities and reduce approximately 5,000 positions globally will allow us to further reduce costs and operate more\nefficiently in 2009. We are aggressively managing all costs in every part of our business to rapidly adjust our cost structure to\ncurrent and expected global demand levels. ... The decisive and thoughtful actions we are taking today will significantly lower our\n\noverall cost structure.\n\nIn the spring of 2011, Greenhaven studied Whirlpool\u2019s fundamentals. We immediately were impressed by management\u2019s ability\nand willingness to slash costs. In spite of a materially subnormal demand for appliances in 2010, the company was able to earn\noperating margins of 5.9 percent. Often, when a company is suffering from particularly adverse industry conditions, it is unable to\nearn any profit at all. But Whirlpool remained moderately profitable. If the company could earn 5.9 percent margins under adverse\n\ncircumstances, what could the company earn once the U.S. housing market and the appliance market returned to normal?\n\n\u2018We made an Excel model that guesstimated what Whirlpool might earn in 2016. The model assumed that the housing industry\nhad recovered by then. About 53 percent of Whirlpool\u2019s revenues came from the United States. The remaining revenues came\nfrom Latin America (mostly Brazil), Europe, and Asia (mostly India). We made conservative guesses about future non-U.S.\n\nrevenues and profit margins, but focused most of our efforts trying to project future U.S. earnings. Our best guess was that if the\n\f"}, "003692.png": {"text": "housing industry recovered, U.S. revenues would grow at a 7 to 8 percent CAGR between 2010 and 2016. We then tried to analyze\nWhirlpool\u2019s operating leverage. After looking at past data and after speaking to management, we estimated that for each $1\nincrease in revenues, Whirlpool\u2019s pretax profits should increase by about $0.20 before future cost reductions (and the company\nwas in the midst of several programs to further reduce costs). Our conclusion was that the company\u2019s revenues and operating\nmargins in 2016 could be roughly $25 billion and 10 percent, and thus its operating profits could be about $2,500 million. We\nestimated that the company\u2019s 2016 interest costs, effective tax rate, and diluted share count would be $275 million, 28 percent,\n\nand 80 million, respectively. Given these educated guesses and projections, Whirlpool would earn about $20 per share in 2016.\n\nThe $20 earnings per share (EPS) estimate assumed that raw material costs stabilized but did not decline. My analysis was that\nthere was a high probability that the prices of steel and copper actually would decline between 2011 and 2016, thereby providing\nWhirlpool with an additional tailwind. The price of copper, for example, started spiking sharply in 2003. The apparent primary\ncause of its fivefold increase in price by 2011 was China. The numbers are telling. Between 2003 and 2011, China\u2019s consumption of\ncopper increased at a 12.4 percent annual rate from 3,056,000 tons to 7,815,000 tons. In 2011, China consumed 4 out of every 10\n\npounds of copper consumed in the world.\n\nMy experience and logic is that when the price of a commodity increases sharply, countervailing forces come into play. Specifically,\nhigh prices incentivize producers to increase their capacity and incentivize users to reduce their consumption through\nconservation or substitution (aluminum can replace copper in many electrical applications). There is elasticity of supply and\nelasticity of demand. The usual result is that supplies start exceeding demands\u2014and, consistent with the laws of supply and\n\ndemand, prices fall.\n\nOver the years, when an industry\u2019s condition turns tight, I have often heard management say \u201cit is different this time; the industry\nhas become disciplined and will not add excess capacity.\u201d However, except for commodities whose supplies and prices are\n\ncontrolled by cartels, I have yet to witness a commodity that has remained in tight supply for a prolonged period.

Unless pricing is controlled by a cartel, commodities tend to be cyclical\u2014very cyclical.\n\nThe proclivity of managements to develop herd instincts when deciding to add to capacity is an example of the \u201cfallacy of\ncomposition,\u201d which states that a decision or action that is rational for one or a few individuals or companies becomes irrational\nif a whole group of individuals or companies follow the decision or action, and the outcome of the irrationality is adverse for all.\nAn example of the fallacy of composition would be the tendency of hundreds of theatergoers to simultaneously rush for the single\nexit when there is a cry of \u201cfire\u201d in a crowded theater. If only a few had rushed for an exit, they likely would have made a quick,\n\nunharmed escape. But the simultaneous rush of hundreds likely would result in trampling and injuries, or worse.\n\nI was a witness to one decision to add to capacity. In 1981, I received a telephone call from Bob Hellendale, the chairman and\npresident of Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation, a manufacturer of newsprint, pulp, and other \u201cpaper\u201d products. Great Northern\nwas considering constructing a large new pulp mill on the Leaf River in Mississippi. Bob Hellendale planned to present the plans\nto Great Northern\u2019s board of directors for approval, and he asked me to listen to and critique his presentation prior to the board\nmeeting. The economics of the proposed mill largely were a function of the cost of the mill, investment tax credits that Great\nNorthern would receive from the U.S. government, the assumed price of pulp, and the assumed production and overhead costs.\nBob Hellendale\u2019s projections assumed that prices would increase at a rate near the top end of their historical range and that costs\nwould increase near the bottom end. It seemed to me that Great Northern\u2019s management wanted to build the mill and had adopted\nassumptions that would justify the construction. When Greenhaven is weighing whether or not to purchase a security, we usually\nmake assumptions that hopefully will prove conservative. Great Northern did just the opposite. So much for discipline within an\n\nindustry that produces commodities!\n\f"}, "003694.png": {"text": "Asecurities analyst or portfolio manager must be careful when basing decisions on statistical information, such as historical price\nor cost trends. Statistics can be misleading if they are incomplete or are slanted to justify a predetermined decision, such as the\ndecision to build the pulp mill. An example of a misleading statistic is the statistician who relied on his conclusion that a stream\n\nwas three feet deep on average\u2014and drowned trying to cross it.\n\nNow that we had concluded that Whirlpool could earn as much as $20 per share in 2016 if the housing industry fully recovered\nby then, we had to value the shares. This proved to be difficult. While I have spent most of my working life valuing companies,\nsometimes I am stumped because of uncertainties. In the case of Whirlpool, I had difficulty assessing the company\u2019s competitive\nposition. It appeared that the company was the low-cost producer in its industry and that most of its competitors were\nunprofitable. There were several other positives: Whirlpool had eliminated a major competitor when it purchased Maytag; Sears\nRoebuck appeared to be losing market share (and in trouble as a company); and GE seemed to have lost some of its competitiveness\ndue to insufficient investments in productivity and design. But there also was a large negative. Two Korean competitors (LG and\nSamsung) seemed bent on gaining market share, even if they needed to slash prices to do so. Whirlpool had filed antidumping\ncharges against the Korean companies, but the outcomes of the charges were uncertain. On balance, my best guess was that\nWhirlpool was not worth more than 15 times its normalized earnings, but likely was worth more than 12 times its earnings, and\ntherefore that the shares might be worth $250 to $300 in 2016. However, I finally decided that my current valuation made little\ndifference. If Whirlpool came close to earning $20 per share in 2016, the shares (which were selling at about $80 in the spring of\n2011) would be an exciting investment regardless of whether they were worth 15 times earnings or 12 times earnings or even\n\n10 times earnings. My plan was to aggressively purchase the shares and then have plenty of time over the next few years to refine\nboth my earnings estimate and my valuation. When you think you are hitting a home run, you need not dwell on whether the ball\nis likely to end up in the lower deck, the upper deck, or out of the ball park\u2014and I did not have to dwell over valuing Whirlpool\u2019s\nshares to know that they were an exciting investment opportunity. After a moderate amount of further due diligence and after\n\nreading a few Wall Street reports on Whirlpool, I started purchasing the company\u2019s shares.\n\f"}, "003695.png": {"text": "Ishould note that, in 2011, Wall Street analysts generally were not positive about Whirlpool\u2019s shares. The analysts were focused\nlargely on the company\u2019s short-term problems to the exclusion of the company\u2019s longer-term potential. A report by J. P. Morgan\ndated April 27, 2011, stated that Whirlpool\u2019s current share price properly reflected the company\u2019s increased costs for raw\nmaterials, the company\u2019s inability to increase its prices, and the current soft demand for appliances. J. P. Morgan maintained its\n\n\u201cneutral\u201d rating on the shares.\n\nThe J. P. Morgan report might have been correct about the near-term outlook for Whirlpool and its shares. But Greenhaven invests\nwith a two- to four-year time horizon and cares little about the near-term outlook for its holdings. We knew that Whirlpool\u2019s\nshares might remain flat or even decline before they appreciated, but any temporary flatness or decline in the price of the shares\nwould not affect the final return on our investment. I viewed Whirlpool\u2019s shares as an abnormally fat pitch. Should a batter let\n\nan abnormally fat pitch go by with hopes that a future pitch will be even fatter? I think not. In fact, I believed there was a high\nprobability that the short-term problems detailed by J. P. Morgan and others likely were already largely or fully discounted into the\n\nprice of the share, and therefore were the opportunity.\n\nI was particularly excited about Whirlpool\u2019s shares because they had the potential to increase several-fold over the next few years\nif the wind happened to blow in the right direction. For example, if the housing industry started to improve sharply in the near\nfuture and if the prices of steel and copper started to decline, it would not have been unreasonable to estimate that Whirlpool\ncould earn about $15 per share in 2014 and that its shares could then roughly triple in price (to roughly $240, or 16 times\nearnings) between 2011 and 2014. I have noticed that, over the years, a disproportionately large percentage of Greenhaven\u2019s\nreturns have come from relatively few of its holdings. In fact, I would make an even stronger statement: a relatively modest\npercentage of our holdings have been responsible for the bulk of our success since our founding in 1987. Greenhaven\u2019s stretch goal\nis to achieve average annual returns of 20 percent for its clients (because 20 percent is a stretch, we generally say that our goal is\n15 to 20 percent). If one in five of our holdings triples in value over a three-year period, then the other four holdings only have to\n\nachieve 12 percent average annual returns in order for our entire portfolio to achieve its stretch goal of 20 percent. For this reason,\n\f"}, "003696.png": {"text": "Greenhaven works extra hard trying to identify potential multibaggers. Whirlpool had the potential to be a multibagger because\nit was selling at a particularly low multiple of its potential earnings power. Of course, most of our potential multibaggers do not\nturn out to be multibaggers. But one cannot hit a multibagger unless one tries, and sometimes our holdings that initially appear\nto be less exciting eventually benefit from positive unforeseen events (handsome black swans) and unexpectedly turn out to be a\ncomplete winner. For this reason, we like to remain fully invested as long as our holdings remain reasonably priced and free from\nlarge risks of permanent loss. I am continually reminded of a favorite saying of Mr. Arthur Ross (my old boss who liked to say\n\neverything twice): \u201cstay in the game, Ed, stay in the game.\u201d\n\nWe purchased a sizable position in Whirlpool in the first half of 2011 at a time when the shares were selling at about $80. In the\nsecond half of 2011, the appliance market and Whirlpool\u2019s earnings were disappointing, and the shares traded down to as low as\nabout $50. When shares of one of our holdings are weak, we ask ourselves a question: are the reasons we purchased the shares still\nvalid (and thus the weakness attributable to a temporary problem), or was our original analysis and judgment flawed? If we believe\nthat our original analysis and judgment was correct, then we often will take advantage of the weakness and purchase additional\nshares. If, however, we come to the conclusion that our original analysis and judgment was faulty, we usually will admit to our\nerror and sell our holding in the shares, hopefully before the loss becomes large. We realize that from time to time we will make\nmistakes. If we never made a mistake, we should be properly criticized for being too conservative. To make money, one must take\nsome risks. The question is where one should draw the line on risks. There is no single correct answer to this question because\n\ndifferent investors have different investment objectives, different balance sheets, and different emotional tolerances to risk.\n\nWe gradually added to our holding in Whirlpool in the second half of 2011 and into 2012. During 2012, I continued to monitor\nthe opinions of Wall Street analysts, particularly those at J. P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs.

One robin does\nnot make a spring, but now there were several robins on Whirlpool\u2019s lawn. I was excited that we had doubled our money in the\n\nshares, and I was excited that our thesis on housing-related stocks appeared to be working.\n\nDuring the spring of 2014, I heard rumors that Whirlpool might be interested in acquiring Indesit, a European manufacturer of\nappliances that had put itself up for sale. limmediately wrote a letter to Jeff Fettig (Whirlpool\u2019s chairman and CEO) suggesting\nthat Whirlpool not acquire Indesit. Whirlpool had a bright future. It did not need to make an acquisition. An acquisition would\nleverage the balance sheet and distract management. Europe was a tough place to do business. Many acquisitions do not turn out\nas planned. The sellers know more than the buyers and may know of problems or uncertainties that are not apparent to the buyers.\nJeff answered me with a \u201cform\u201d letter that stated that Whirlpool would acquire Indesit only if the acquisition made sense for the\n\nshareholders. What else could he say?\n\nInJuly, Whirlpool announced an agreement to acquire Indesit for $2 billion. Chris, Josh, and I immediately telephoned Jeff. He\n\ncalmed us. Indesit had revenues of $3.5 billion, so the company was being acquired for only 0.57 times revenues. There would\n\f"}, "003698.png": {"text": "be about $350 million of synergies (equal to more than $3 per share after taxes) when Whirlpool\u2019s European operations were\ncombined with Indesit\u2019s. Two head offices would be combined into one. Plants would be consolidated. Increased purchasing power\nshould lead to lower prices for purchased parts. Efficiencies would be gained through best practices. Research and design would\nbe consolidated. Furthermore, about $1.4 billion of the revenues were from Russia and Eastern Europe, where long-term growth\nprospects were strong. In 2013, Whirlpool\u2019s European operations only broke even. Jeff\u2019s best guess was that when the synergies\nwere fully realized in about 2017, the European operations should have 7 to 8 percent operating margins on well over $7 billion\nof revenues. We thanked Jeff for his time and put a pencil to his estimates, realizing that he had a vested interest in making the\nacquisition appear attractive. Seven to 8 percent margins on $7 to $8 billion of revenues would result in $490 to $640 million\n\nof operating earnings. A 4 percent interest rate on $2 billion of additional borrowings to pay for the acquisition would increase\nannual interest expense by $80 million. Thus, if Jeff\u2019s projections happened to be correct, Whirlpool\u2019s European operations would\ncontribute $410 to $560 million to pretax profits in 2017, or $3.70 to $5 per share after taxes at a 28 percent effective rate and\nbased on 80 million shares outstanding. Whirlpool was taking a risk, but the risk appeared worth taking. I regretted having\n\nwritten the negative letter to Jeff. I had jumped the gun.\n\nWhirlpool also made a smaller acquisition in 2014: a 51 percent interest in Hefei Sanyo, a Chinese manufacturer and distributor\nof appliances. Hefei sold $862 million of appliances in 2013 through about 30,000 distributors. Whirlpool had only 3,000\ndistributors in China. By acquiring the 51 percent controlling interest, Whirlpool could market its line of appliances through\nHefei\u2019s thousands of distributors, thus hopefully materially expanding its revenues in China from a very small base. Jeff Fettig\nbelieved that Hefei\u2019s revenues could grow at a 15 to 25 percent rate and that its operating margins could be 8 to 10 percent.\nAssuming growth at a 20 percent rate and margins at 9 percent, Hefei would contribute about $0.60 per share to Whirlpool\u2019s 2016\n\nEPS\u2014not a game changer, but a material addition to earnings in a large and rapidly growing country.\n\nAt the time we originally purchased our shares in Whirlpool, we had one concept: the company and its shares would benefit from\n\nthe recovery of the housing market.

Who started the company\u2014and\nwhy and how? How did the company\u2019s industry come into being? Histories can be informative, interesting, and sometimes\nentertaining. The way I look at it, the holdings in our portfolios are my career\u2019s family members\u2014and I would never agreeably\n\nmarry a girlfriend without first learning about her background and meeting her parents.\n\nFrom the earliest days of recorded history, we have evidence of man\u2019s interest in flight, especially the flight of birds. If birds could\nfly, why couldn\u2019t man? Imaginations ran. In Greek mythology, Daedalus used wax to attach wings of bird feathers to his son Icarus.\nDaedalus\u2019s device worked, until Icarus disobediently flew too close to the sun, with exceedingly ill consequences when the sun\u2019s\nheat melted the wax. Many centuries later, in 852 A.D., one Armen Firman tried to mimic a bird in flight. He constructed two\nwings out of vulture feathers, attached the wings to his arms, \u201cflew\u201d out of a tower in Cordoba (Spain), and promptly crash landed,\ninjuring his back in the process. Then, in 1010, an English monk tried flying from a tower in the Abbey of Malmesbury. He broke\nboth legs. Not to be deterred, in 1496 a man named Seccio attempted to fly from a tower in Nuremberg (Germany). He broke both\n\narms. Thus, wax fasteners and tower jumping did little to advance the flight of human beings.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci did advance the science of flight. After studying the flight of birds, he designed a number of possible flying\nmachines, including types of gliders, rotorcrafts, and parachutes. In 1496, da Vinci actually built a glider. However, the glider\n\nnever was tested, so human flight continued to remain an unfulfilled dream.\n\f"}, "003701.png": {"text": "The dream advanced in the early seventeenth century when Galileo proved that air has weight. If air has weight, then man could\nfabricate a hollow sphere out of lightweight material, pump the air out of the sphere, and thus create a lighter than air vehicle that\ncould rise into the sky. Such a vehicle was called a balloon. It is difficult to form a vacuum inside a balloon made out of lightweight\nmaterial, but if the inside of the balloon were filled with hot air (which is lighter than room temperature air), man finally could\nbuild a device that could fly. On August 8, 1708, Bartolomeu de Gusmao, a Brazilian priest, made a small balloon out of paper,\nplaced the open end of the balloon over a fire, and, with members of the Portuguese royalty in audience, watched as the balloon\n\nlifted into the air by more than 10 feet.\n\nBalloon technology developed slowly for the next 75 years, but then accelerated sharply in 1783, which was a breakout year for\nthe success and popularity of lighter-than-air flights. On June 4, 1783, the French brothers Joseph and Jacques Montgolfier, who\nowned a paper mill, held a flame under a large silk-lined paper balloon and, in front of a large crowd of onlookers, watched as the\nballoon lifted by more than 6,000 feet into the air. Then, on September 19, the Montgolfiers flew a hot air balloon carrying a sheep,\na rooster, and a duck for eight minutes at Versailles in front of King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, much of the French court, anda\n\ncrowd of tens of thousands of curious onlookers.\n\nAt the same time that the Montgolfiers were hard at work with their hot air balloons, French Professor Jacques Charles, along\nwith the Roberts brothers, were busy designing and building a hydrogen balloon. In 1766, Henry Cavendish discovered hydrogen,\nwhich is lighter than air. Jacques Charles believed that hydrogen balloons would be vastly superior to hot air balloons. But first, a\ngas-tight material had to be invented. This happened when Jacques Charles and the two Roberts developed a gas-tight rubberized\nsilk, made by dissolving rubber in turpentine and then varnishing the solution on a sheet of silk. In August 1783, Jacques Charles\nand the Robert brothers fabricated a rubberized silk balloon, filled the balloon with hydrogen, and released it from the Champ\n\nde Mars in Paris, now the site of the Eiffel Tower. A large crowd, which included Benjamin Franklin, was on hand for the release.\n\nWhen untethered, the balloon rose and headed north, followed by dozens of chasers on horseback. When the balloon landed 13\n\f"}, "003702.png": {"text": "miles away in the village of Gonesse, local villagers were so terrified of the strange, alien looking object that they attacked it with\n\npitchforks, which became an inglorious end to a glorious and historic flight.\n\nNow that a sheep, a duck, and a rooster had flown, the Montgolfiers were anxious to launch a manned flight. On October 19, ina\ntest flight, three Frenchman successfully rose into the air in a balloon that remained tethered to the ground. Next, it was time for a\nmanned free flight. At first, King Louis XVI suggested that condemned criminals should be the guinea pigs for the dangerous first\nfree flight, but the scientist Jean-Francois Pilatre de Rozier and the Marquis Francois d\u2019Arlandes successfully volunteered to be the\npioneers. On November 21, a balloon carrying the two Frenchman lifted off from the center of Paris, rose to an altitude of about\n500 feet, and drifted about 5 miles in 20 minutes before landing. The manned flight was considered an historic event that excited\nthe spectators. Benjamin Franklin, after witnessing the flight, wrote in his diary: \u201cWe observed it lift off in the most majestic\nmanner. When it reached around 250 feet in altitude, the intrepid voyagers lowered their hats to salute the spectators. We could\n\nnot help feeling a certain mixture of awe and admiration.\u201d\n\nAfter the November 21 manned flight, a balloon craze swept through France. Dinner plates were decorated with pictures of\n\nballoons, as were chairs and the dial of clocks. Balloons became the talk of the town and throughout much of Europe.\n\nThe hot air and hydrogen balloons of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were interesting and popular novelties,\nbut largely were impractical because they depended on winds to float from one locality to another. A breakthrough came in 1852\nwhen Henry Giffard designed a nonrigid, steerable hydrogen airship that was powered by a 3-horsepower steam engine attached\ntoa three-bladed propeller. On September 24, Giffard made the first powered and controlled air flight in a 17-mile trip from Paris to\nTrappes. But it was inconvenient to have a steam engine aboard an airship, and a 3-horsepower engine was not powerful enough to\n\nbuck winds any stronger than a breeze. Thus, the Giffard airship was an advance but not a solution to air travel.\n\nOver the next few decades, progress toward pragmatic manned flight was slow but steady. One advance came in 1884 when a\n\nFrench army captain and colonel flew the electric-powered La France airship (now called a dirigible) at four miles per hour ina\n\f"}, "003703.png": {"text": "five-mile loop that included an upwind leg as well as a downwind leg. The La France\u2019s 8.5-horsepower electric engine was powered\nby chlorochromic batteries that weighed about 1,000 pounds. Because of the heavy weight and limited capacity of the batteries,\n\nthe La France was not the answer to commercial manned flight.\n\nIn 1872, Paul Haenlein, a German engineer, designed a 164-foot-long dirigible that was powered by an internal combustion engine\nattached to a propeller that was 15 feet in diameter. The engine was fueled by coal gas. On December 13, Haenlein\u2019s dirigible was\nsuccessfully tested at Brunn, Germany. Other tests of dirigibles powered by internal combustion engines continued in the 1880s\nand 1890s. By the late 1890s, it became clear that commercially successful steerable dirigibles powered by internal combustion\nengines someday could be designed and produced. But, as the nineteenth century came to a close, to quote from a Robert Frost\n\npoem, the sky \u201cat least this far, for all the fuss of the populace, stays more popular than populous.\u201d\n\nThen, in the early 1900s, Count Ferdinand Zeppelin successfully tested a 385-foot-long steerable dirigible that could travel at\n\na speed of close to 20 miles per hour for several hundred miles at an altitude of several thousand feet. The count had become\ninterested in the concept of manned air travel in 1874 after hearing a lecture on the possible use of dirigibles to carry mail. After\nretiring from the army in 1890, the count went to work designing a rigid frame air ship that was durable and reliable. The first\n\u201czeppelin\u201d was tested in Germany over Lake Constance on July 2, 1890. While the first test and many subsequent tests were\naborted due to problems, by 1909 the zeppelin was ready for commercial flights. The count then formed an airline (popularly\n\ncalled DELAG) and started offering pleasure cruises for up to 20 adventurous passengers at a time. Commercial aviation was born.\n\nHowever, the use of zeppelins for air travel soon was eclipsed by the commercialization of heavier-than-air flight. While many\nscientists contributed to understanding how heavier-than-air vehicles someday could fly commercially, many believe that Sir\nGeorge Cayley, the sixth Baronet of Brompton, is the true father of the airplane. Born to wealth in 1773, Sir Cayley became an\n\ninventor and engineer. He is credited with inventing self-righting lifeboats, automatic signals for railway crossings, seat belts,\n\nan internal combustion engine fueled by gunpowder, and several types of \u201cflying machines.\u201d His most important aeronautical\n\f"}, "003704.png": {"text": "achievements include a scientific understanding of how birds fly; a clarification of how a cambered airfoil could provide sufficient\nlift to offset gravity; an improved understanding of thrust and drag; and the design of gliders that included wings, fuselages,\n\nand tails with horizontal stabilizers and vertical fins. In 1848, he built and tested a glider large enough to carry a child, and five\nyears later, he built a glider large enough to carry a full-sized man. The first manned glider flight took place on a sloped meadow\nat Brompton Dale, which was about a mile from Cayley\u2019s Brompton Hall estate. The glider was carried to the top of the slope, a\n\u201cpilot\u201d (one of Cayley\u2019s coachmen) climbed into the craft, and then workmen grabbed ropes that were attached to the craft and\nstarted hauling it down the slope until it lifted into the air. The glider flew about 600 feet across a small valley before it crash-\nlanded.\n\nSir Cayley had helped prove that a fixed cambered wing attached to a fuselage could provide sufficient lift to fly human beings\nthrough the air. Now, if engine-driven propellers could be used to provide the thrust needed to drive the gliders forward, gliders\ncould become airplanes. In 1896, Samuel Pierpont Langley, an American scientist and inventor, designed such an airplane, which\nhe named the Aerodrome #5. Langley was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, in 1834. He attended Boston Latin School where, at\nthe age of 9, he started reading books on astronomy. After false starts as an apprentice architect and a telescope maker, Langley\naccepted a job as an assistant at Harvard College's observatory. This led to subsequent jobs at other observatories where he\nresearched and advanced the science of astronomy. In 1886, he was awarded a medal from the National Academy of Sciences for\nhis contribution to solar physics, especially to the understanding of sunspots. A year later, he was appointed the third secretary of\n\nthe Smithsonian Institution, which was an honor as well as a recognition of his abilities.\n\nIn the 1880s, Langley developed an interest in aeronautics. He first experimented with aircraft that were powered by rubber\nbands, but he soon abandoned rubber bands in favor of small steam engines. On May 6, 1896, Langley placed Aerodrome #5, which\n\u2018was powered by a steam engine and was unmanned, on top of a houseboat that was anchored on the Potomac River near Quantico,\nVirginia. To provide a requisite initial thrust, #5 was attached to a spring-actuated catapult. When the catapult was released,\n\n#5 flew more than 3,000 feet at a speed of about 25 miles per hour before landing in the river. A second test on May 6 also was\n\f"}, "003705.png": {"text": "successful. Then, on November 28, Aerodrome #6, also unmanned, flew about 5,000 feet. The November 28 test was witnessed\nand photographed by Alexander Graham Bell. Buoyed by these successes and their favorable publicity, Langley moved full speed\nahead, and with funding from the U.S. government, he designed and successfully tested aerodromes that were powered by 52-\nhorsepower internal combustion engines. Finally, after several years of design and testing, Langley was ready for a manned test of\nan aerodrome. On October 7, 1903, Charles M. Manley, a Cornell-educated mechanical engineer, attempted to pilot the aerodrome\noff the anchored houseboat, but a wing clipped the catapult, and the plane plummeted into the Potomac. Luckily, pilot Manley was\nnot injured. Then, on December 8, Manley climbed into the aerodrome for a second test. This time, the plane broke apart just after\nleaving the catapult. Again, Manley escaped injury. Upon study, Langley concluded that the aerodrome was too fragile for a 52-\n\nhorsepower engine.\n\nNine days after the second aerodrome crash, the Wright brothers successfully flew the Kitty Hawk Flyer 1 at Kitty Hawk, North\nCarolina\u2014and history was made. Wilbur (1867-1912) and Orville (1871-1948) Wright were born in the Midwest at a time when\nthe industrial revolution sparked unusual interest in science and experimentation. In 1878, the boys\u2019 father brought home a toy\nhelicopter for his sons to play with. The helicopter was about a foot long and was made of paper, bamboo, and cork. A rubber band\npowered its rotor. The boys were fascinated with the helicopter and played with it until it broke. Then, they built a replica. Years\n\nlater, Wilbur and Orville claimed that the toy helicopter sparked their interest in flight.\n\nWilbur and Orville both attended, but did not complete, high school. Orville dropped out of school in 1889 to design his own\nprinting press, and soon the entrepreneurial brothers started publishing a weekly newspaper, the West Side News, with Wilbur as\neditor. Three years later, the brothers became interested in the bicycle craze that was sweeping the nation soon after the invention\nof the modern \u201csafety bike.\u201d The brothers opened a bicycle sales and repair shop in Dayton, Ohio, and later started manufacturing\ntheir own brand under the name of the Wright Cycle Company. Then, in the late 1890s, intrigued by newspaper reports of\nLangley\u2019s experiments with flying, the brothers became interested in designing an airplane of their own. In May 1899, Wilbur\n\nwrote a letter to the Smithsonian Institution requesting publications and information on airplanes. Then, using the discoveries\n\f"}, "003706.png": {"text": "of da Vinci, Cayley, Langley, and others, the brothers started designing an airplane. From the start, the Wright brothers were\nconvinced that existing knowledge of lift and thrust was adequate for successful flights, but that the problems of controlling\nflights had not been solved. Based on observations of birds and bicycles, the brothers came up with the notion that airplanes\nshould bank during turns. This notion led to the design of wings that could change shapes, thereby permitting aircraft to roll\ninto turns. They also invented other methods and devices that allowed pilots to control flights, such as using rudders to eliminate\nadverse yaw. With their new methods for controlling flight, between mid-1900 and the fall of 1902, the brothers conducted more\nthan 700 tests with gliders. The hundreds of successful tests convinced the brothers that they were now ready to build a powered\naircraft. In early 1903, the Flyer 1 was built and tested in a wind tunnel. After a failed search to purchase an efficient lightweight\nmotor for the Flyer, the brothers asked their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, to build an engine. The Taylor engine was rated at 12\n\nhorsepower, far less than the 52-horsepower engine that proved too powerful for Samuel Langley\u2019s aerodrome.\n\nBy December, the Flyer was ready to fly. With Wilbur as pilot, an attempted flight was made on December 13, but the engine\nimmediately stalled and the plane flew for only three seconds. After repair of minor damage, another attempt was made on\nDecember 17. At 10:30 a.m., with Orville at the controls, the Flyer successfully flew 120 feet in 12 seconds. The flight was\nwitnessed by five people, including John Daniels, who photographed the plane in flight. Three other manned fights were\nconducted that day, with Orville and Wilbur taking turns as pilots. The fourth flight covered 852 feet in 59 seconds. The Wright\n\nbrothers were to become famous.\n\nBetween 1904 and 1908, the brothers worked on improving the reliability and mobility of their planes. A major advancement\ncame in August 1908, when Wilbur made a series of technically challenging flights, including figure eights, at the Hunaudieres\nhorse-racing track near Le Mans, France. Thousands came to witness the flights. The French originally were skeptical of the\nWrights\u2019 achievements, but after the demonstrations at Hunaudieres, the French treated the brothers as heroes. Louis Bleriot, a\nleading French aviator, wrote: \u201cFor a long time, the Wright brothers have been accused in Europe of bluff... but today they are\n\nhallowed in France.\u201d The Wright brothers, and aviation in general, had become front-page news.\n\f"}, "003707.png": {"text": "For the next several years, there was a constant parade of firsts. In 1909, a woman (Baroness de la Roche) learned to fly. In 1910,\na US. Navy pilot flew a Curtis plane off the deck of a ship. Also in 1910, Henri Fabre became the first to fly a floatplane. In 1912,\nHarriet Quimby flew across the English Channel in a Bleriot monoplane. And in 1914, the first aerial combat occurred when Allied\n\nand German pilots fired at each other with pistols and rifles (all without much effect).\n\nOn July 4, 1914, a flight took place in Seattle, Washington, that had a major effect on the history of aviation. On that day,\n\na barnstormer named Terah Maroney was hired to perform a flying demonstration as part of Seattle\u2019s Independence Day\ncelebrations. After displaying aerobatics in his Curtis floatplane, Maroney landed and offered to give free rides to spectators.\nOne spectator, William Edward Boeing, a wealthy owner of a lumber company, quickly accepted Maroney\u2019s offer. Boeing was so\n\nexhilarated by the flight that he completely caught the aviation bug\u2014a bug that was to be with him for the rest of his life.\n\nWilliam Boeing was born in Detroit in 1881 to Mary and Wilhelm Boeing. Wilhelm, who had immigrated to the United States from\nGermany at the age of 20, became a wealthy owner and operator of timberlands. Young William spent most of his adolescence at\nSwiss boarding schools. He then studied at Yale, but left before graduating in order to start a logging company of his own in Grays\n\nHarbor, Washington.\n\nBoeing had first become interested in airplanes when he attended an air show in Los Angeles in 1910. Upon returning from\n\nthe air show to his home in Seattle, he approached a friend, George Conrad Westervelt, a naval officer and engineer who had\nstudied aeronautics at MIT, about the possibility of building an airplane. The discussions initially were preliminary in nature.\nHowever, after Boeing\u2019s ride with Maroney in 1914, the discussions became serious and led to a decision to enter the business\nof manufacturing airplanes. Westervelt would design a single-engine floatplane, and Boeing would provide the financing and\nthe \u201cmanufacturing plant,\u201d which initially was a boathouse on Lake Union owned by Boeing. In 1915, Westervelt went to work\ndesigning a plane and Boeing went to California to take flying lessons from Glenn Martin, a pioneer aviator. The first Westervelt-\n\ndesigned aircraft, a two-seat floatplane called the B&W, was ready to fly by late spring 1916. On June 15, with William Boeing at\n\f"}, "003708.png": {"text": "the controls, the plane taxied across part of Lake Union, picked up speed, and lifted majestically into the sky. The inaugural flight,\nas well as subsequent flights later in June, confirmed that the plane was a technological success. By July, Boeing was ready to start\nproducing B&W planes in mass. He formed a company called Pacific Aero Products Company to build and market the planes. The\nU.S. Navy was an obvious early prospect for B& Ws, but the Navy turned Boeing down, instead opting to stick with the more proven\nCurtis floatplanes. Undeterred, Boeing finally sold two planes to the New Zealand Flying School. Pacific Aero Products (which was\n\nrenamed the Boeing Airplane Company in 1917) was in business.\n\nDuring the early days of aeronautics, improvements came rapidly. In late 1916, Boeing designed an improved floatplane, which\n\nit called the Model C. The Model C was ready to be marketed in April 1917, the same month that the United States entered World\nWar I. Boeing believed that the Navy now might need training aircraft. He was correct. The Navy ordered two Model Cs that were\nshipped to the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida. The planes performed so well that the Navy ordered 50 more. The order put\n\nBoeing on the map.\n\nBoeing\u2019s business flourished during the war, but predictably fell off sharply after the armistice. The company responded to the\nfall-off by designing a plane for commercial use. Fishing enthusiasts were interested in accessing the many isolated lakes in the\nNorthwest United States. Boeing designed a small floatplane (called the B-1) to satisfy this need, but initially only a few were\n\npurchased. Interest in aeronautics had waned after the end of World War I.\n\nHowever, interest in air flights quickly accelerated after Charles Lindberg\u2019s highly publicized 1927 transatlantic flight in the\nSpirit of St. Louis, and Boeing eventually was able to sell 13 of the B-1s. Thirteen is not a large number, but was a respectable\nnumber for the era because in the 1920s, air travel remained an uncomfortable novelty. Airplane fuselages were thin sheets of\nuninsulated metal that often rattled. Passengers often stuck cotton in their ears to dampen the noise of the engines. Cabins were\n\nnot pressurized, so airplanes had to fly around mountains. Flying at night was unsafe. Even in the late 1920s, travelers could cross\n\f"}, "003709.png": {"text": "the United States by train faster than by air (and much more comfortably to boot). In 1926, only 6,000 Americans traveled on\n\ncommercial airliners.\n\nWhile Boeing sold a number of planes to the military in the 1920s and early 1930s, sales of commercial planes were almost\nnonexistent until 1933, when the company started marketing its model 247. The twin-engine 247 was revolutionary and\ngenerally is recognized as the world\u2019s first modern airplane. It had a capacity to carry 10 passengers and a crew of 3. It hada\ncruising speed of 189 mph and could fly about 745 miles before needing to be refueled. It was the first plane used for regularly\nscheduled service between New York and the West Coast, a flight that took 20 hours, with seven stops. Seventy-five of the\n\nplanes were sold before Boeing replaced the 247 with the much larger model 307 Stratoliner. The Stratoliner had a capacity\n\nof 33 passengers and a crew of 5. It could cruise at 220 mph and had a range of 2,390 miles. Importantly, the Stratoliner had a\npressurized cabin, so it could fly above mountains and above turbulence. The Stratoliner should have been a winner, but the plane\ndid not make its maiden flight until the last day of 1938, and World War II commenced before the plane became established. Only\n\n10 were ever built.\n\nBoeing helped the Allies defeat Germany. The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber and the B-29 Superfortress bomber became\nlegendary. More than 12,500 B-17s and more than 3,500 B-29s were built (some by Boeing itself and some by other companies that\nhad spare capacity). Boeing prospered during World War II, but at the end of the war, the Air Force immediately canceled orders for\nthousands of planes, and Boeing was forced to reduce its employment levels by 70,000 and redirect its efforts back to commercial\naviation. The company then redesigned the B-29 into a four-engine, long-range commercial plane named the 377 Sratrocruiser,\nwhich first flew in mid-1947. However, the Stratocruiser soon was obsoleted by a destructive technology: the jet engine. In\nmid-1949, the de Havilland Aircraft Company started testing its Comet jetliner, and the Comet commenced carrying paying\npassengers three years later. It was clear that Boeing had to respond. And it did. Boeing started to develop its 707 jet in 1952. Tests\nstarted two years later and commercial flights in 1958. The 707 was a hit and soon became the leading commercial plane in the\n\nworld.\n\f"}, "003710.png": {"text": "Over the next 30 years, Boeing grew into a large and highly successful company. It introduced many models of popular commercial\nplanes that covered a wide range of capacities, and it became a leader in the production of high-technology military aircraft and\nsystems. Moreover, in 1996 and 1997, the company materially increased its size and capabilities by acquiring North American\nAviation and McDonnell Douglas. Between 1960 and 2000, Boeing\u2019s revenues increased from $1.56 billion to $51.32 billion, and\n\nits net income increased from $25 million to $2,128 million.\n\nIn the 1990s, Boeing realized that it needed to find a replacement for its aging 767. Initially, the company considered two\nalternatives. The first was a plane that could travel just under the speed of sound and that had about the same fuel efficiency as\nthe 767. The second was an enlarged version of the 747 that could compete head-on with Airbus\u2019s planned A-380. However, in\n2002, Boeing dropped both alternatives in favor of a lightweight, carbon-composite, fuel-efficient aircraft that would offer about\n20 percent reduced fuel consumption instead of higher speed or larger capacity. The proposed new model was named the 787\nDreamliner. Boeing completed the basic concept of the new plane by the end of 2003. Four months later, Japan\u2019s ANA became the\n787\u2019s first customer, with an order of 50 planes. By the end of 2005, a total of 288 orders had been received. The large number of\n\nearly orders verified the need for a new fuel-efficient plane.\n\nThe 787 required many new technologies. Strong and lightweight carbon fiber composites, which previously had not been used\nstructurally on commercial aircraft, make up about 50 percent of the plane\u2019s primary structure, including its fuselage and wings.\nThere are many other firsts. For example, each section of the fuselage is one piece of wrapped composite material. On previous\nBoeing planes, each section was made of about 1,500 sheets of aluminum held together by more than 40,000 fasteners. Also, the\n787 has new hydraulics, new engines, new landing gears, new electronic controls, new avionics, and new lithium-ion batteries. It\nis manufactured from 2.3 million parts. In spite of the newness and complexity, Boeing hoped to reduce the time to develop the\n\nplane from the normal six years to four years, with a first test flight scheduled for August 2007.\n\f"}, "003711.png": {"text": "However, in January 2007, the 787 program started falling behind schedule. Suppliers were late delivering parts, some fasteners\nwere improperly installed, segments of the wing needed to be redesigned, and some software was incomplete. Finally, on\nDecember 15, 2009, more than two years late, a 787 taxied down a runway in Everett, Washington, and lifted off for a three-hour\nmaiden test flight. For the next nearly two years, Boeing extensively tested the 787 and found and corrected a number of \u201cbugs.\u201d\nMany investors criticized Boeing for the bugs, but I was both sympathetic and understanding. To my way of thinking, it would be\nunreasonable to assume that Boeing could assemble 2.3 million parts into a newly designed plane without incurring some serious\n\nproblems, especially since many of the structures and systems were new and advanced technologies.\n\nOn September 27, 2011, about three years late, ANA accepted delivery of its first 787. Thirty days later, after testing and training,\nthe plane was placed in commercial service, carrying a full load of passengers from Tokyo to Hong Kong. ANA auctioned tickets for\n\nthe inaugural commercial flight, with the highest bidder paying $34,000 for a seat.\n\nBut the 787 still experienced start-up problems. On February 6, 2012, Boeing said it discovered manufacturing errors in some\nfuselage sections. On July 23, 2012, defects were found in five Rolls-Royce engines. Five days later, a 787 engine failed during\ntesting. On September 5, ANA was forced to abort a take-off after white smoke billowed from the left engine (the white smoke was\ncaused by a breakdown in a hydraulic system). On December 5, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered inspections of\n\nall 787s following reports of fuel leaks.\n\nIn late 2012, the media and Wall Street generally were highly critical of Boeing for the myriad of problems. After reading the\ncriticism, I reasoned that the negativism likely was weighing on the price of Boeing\u2019s shares and that the price could appreciate\n\nmaterially once the start-up problems were solved. I decided to research and analyze the company.\n\nI started with Boeing\u2019s balance sheet. I quickly noticed that the company had more cash than debt, even after investing more than\n\n$20 billion of cash in the development of the 787. However, the company did have large pension and health care liabilities: $23.0\n\f"}, "003712.png": {"text": "billion versus only $8.2 billion five years earlier. I would need to analyze this $23.0 billion balance sheet liability before purchasing\n\nany shares, but first I would analyze the other key fundamentals of the company.\n\nBoeing has two businesses: (1) commercial aviation and (2) defense. The production of larger commercial planes is a duopoly\nwith almost impenetrable barriers to entry, as evidenced by the technology and preproduction costs required to produce the 787.\nMichael Porter, the highly respected professor at Harvard Business School, identifies five forces that should determine the long-\n\nterm profitability of a company. Boeing\u2019s commercial aviation business passes Porter\u2019s five forces test with flying colors:\n\n1. Threat of new entrants. It would require decades and tens of billions of dollars for a new entrant to develop and test planes that\ncould compete with Boeing\u2019s and Airbus\u2019s larger planes. Furthermore, a new entrant would have to win the confidence of the\n\nairlines and the flying public.\n\nN\n\n. Threat of substitution. I could not imagine that high-speed trains or ships, or any future new method of travel, would dent the\n\ndemand for air travel in the immediate future.\n\nw\n\n. Power over suppliers. Boeing is a very important customer for many of its suppliers, and Boeing has the option of playing one\nsupplier off against another. It can tell a supplier that, unless it reduces price, it will lose future business to a competitor. Thus,\n\nBoeing has large bargaining power when negotiating price.\n\n4. Power of customers. The airlines can and do seek bids from both Boeing and Airbus. However, some of Boeing\u2019s models\nsometimes are a better fit for a particular need. In particular, Boeing\u2019s 777 seems to have an edge over Airbus\u2019s long-distance\nwide-body planes. And, importantly, the 787, because of its fuel efficiency, has a competitive edge. In spite of all of the 787\u2019s\nproblems and adverse publicity, by December 2012, Boeing had 799 orders for 787s valued at an estimated $100 billion.\n\nOn balance, the commercial airplane business is competitive, but the competition is limited. Airplanes are far from being a\n\ncommodity.\n\f"}, "003713.png": {"text": "5. Degree of rivalry. Boeing and Airbus certainly were rivals, but both enjoyed large backlogs that should have mitigated cutthroat\ncompetition. In December 2012, Boeing had an undelivered firm backlog of about 4,300 airplanes, which, based on 2012\n\ndeliveries of 601 aircraft, equaled 7.1 years of production.\n\nBoeing also seemed to have an experienced and talented management and an excellent reputation with the airlines and the flying\npublic. Furthermore, because of the strong demand for new airplanes, Boeing\u2019s annual production was expected to increase from\n\n601 planes in 2012 to more than 750 in 2015. The company\u2019s commercial business was booming.\n\nBoeing\u2019s defense business, on the other hand, was not booming. The U.S. government was reining in its expenditures for defense.\nSome of the decline in demand was being offset by increased demand from foreign governments, but, on balance, it appeared\nlikely that Boeing\u2019s defense revenues would decline slightly between 2012 and 2015. However, Boeing was reducing its costs to the\n\nextent that defense profits might be held flat, or even increase some.\n\nBased on the preceding preliminary analysis, I made a model of Boeing\u2019s future earnings. The preliminary model concluded that\nthe company could earn at least $7 per share in 2015. The shares at the time were selling at about $75, or at less than 11 times the\n$7\u2014a very low price-to-earnings (PE) ratio for such a strong and well-positioned company. Thus, I was inspired to delve deeply\n\ninto Boeing\u2019s fundamentals.\n\nAfter a few weeks studying Boeing and thinking about the company\u2019s probable future, I decided to build a more detailed model\nof the company\u2019s earnings per share (EPS). The model would contain (1) estimates of 2015 earnings for each model of Boeing\u2019s\ncommercial planes; (2) an estimate of 2015 earnings for the defense segment; (3) a projection of nonoperating expenses, including\n\nresearch, pension, and net interest; (4) the expected effective tax rate; and (5) the projected number of shares outstanding.\n\nWhen calculating the profits of its commercial airplanes, Boeing uses \u201cprogram\u201d accounting. Under program accounting, Boeing\n\nfirst makes a conservative estimate of how many planes of a given model will be built. This quantity is known as the block size.\n\f"}, "003714.png": {"text": "Then, for the planes in the block, Boeing estimates the average price that will be received and the expected average cost per plane.\nThus, the profitability of each plane in a block is relatively constant and predictable from year to year, except in years when there\nis a major revision in the block size or in the estimated average price or cost. I had reasonably good estimates of the profitability of\neach of Boeing\u2019s models, so, by knowing the projected production rate for each, I could estimate the 2015 profits for each model. I\nnote that the 787 was expected to be only marginally profitable in 2015. My best information was that the average price of a 787\nwas roughly $125 million and that the average projected cash cost of producing the first 1,100 planes (which was the initial block\nsize) was a bit over $100 million, indicating a cash profit of something under $25 million per plane. Boeing had capitalized more\nthan $20 billion of the 787\u2019s design and preproduction costs\u2014and this $20+ billion would be amortized over the 1,100 block size\nat a rate of about $20 million per plane. Thus, I guesstimated that, while the average cash profit per 787 in the block would be close\nto $25 million, the average reported profit would be only about $3 to $4 million. Boeing\u2019s 2015 production of 787s was expected to\nbe 120 planes. Thus, in 2015, the operating profit of the 787s was estimated at only $360 to $480 million, or only $0.30 to $0.45\n\nper share after taxes.\n\nI then projected that the profits of Boeing\u2019s defense segment would remain relatively flat, that research and development expenses\n\nwould decline some now that the 787 was in production, and that interest expense would remain flat.\n\nThe next step was to take a close look at pension expense. Boeing used generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for its\nearnings statements. Under GAAP accounting, when calculating pension liabilities and pension expense, future liabilities are\ndiscounted to reflect the value of time. The discount rate used is a function of longer-term interest rates on bonds. Between\n2008 and 2012, longer-term interest rates fell by about 2.25 percent. This meant that Boeing\u2019s reported pension liabilities and\nreported pension expense increased sharply. I strongly believed that interest rates at the end of 2012 were abnormally and\nlikely unsustainably low and, therefore, that Boeing\u2019s balance sheet overstated pension liabilities and that its income statement\nunderstated reported earnings. For each 1 percent future increase in interest rates, Boeing\u2019s pension liabilities and pension\n\nexpense would decline by $9.1 billion and $930 million, respectively. Therefore, if interest rates returned to 2008 levels, Boeing\u2019s\n\f"}, "003715.png": {"text": "stated pension liabilities and pension expense would decline by about $20 billion and $2 billion, respectively. After reaching this\nconclusion, I no longer was concerned about the magnitude of the company\u2019s pension liabilities, and I was convinced that the\ncompany\u2019s reported earnings were understated because the true economic costs of funding the pension obligations were far less\nthan the costs reported under GAAP. Many other companies were experiencing the same disparity in their pension accounting,\nand many had started to report non-GAAP earnings that adjusted pension expense to reflect economic costs. Would Boeing also\nstart reporting non-GAAP earnings? I did not know, but I decided that my model should include two estimates for 2015 EPS, one\n\nbased on GAAP and one based the economic costs of the pension plans.\n\nAfter projecting Boeing\u2019s effective tax rate and diluted share count, I double-checked my model for reasonableness. Based on the\nassumptions in the model, which did seem reasonable, I concluded that Boeing\u2019s 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP earnings could be\n\nroughly $7.50 per share and $8.25 per share, respectively.\n\nNext, I had to value the shares. In 2015, about two-thirds of the company\u2019s total estimated earnings would be from commercial\naviation and the remaining one third from defense. I believed that Boeing\u2019s commercial aviation business was unusually attractive\nand was worth close to 20 times earnings (I settled on 19 times). The defense business could be divided into two subsegments: (1)\nsales to the U.S. government, which I believed was a subpar business, and (2) sales to foreign governments, which I believed was\nan above-average business. On balance, I valued the defense business at 15 times and, therefore, the whole company at about 17.7\ntimes. I was convinced that the 17.7 PE ratio should be applied to projected non-GAAP earnings and, thus, that Boeing might be\nworth about $145 in 2015.\n\nThe $145 valuation appeared compelling versus the existing share price of about $75. However, before purchasing the shares,\nIhad to consider the risks that the 787 program might develop unsolvable problems. The plane had been tested for nearly two\nyears, had been approved by the FAA, and was in commercial service. Boeing\u2019s engineering-oriented management had a history\n\nof successfully solving technological problems. But what if the many problems that had recently plagued the airplane were more\n\f"}, "003716.png": {"text": "than just normal start-up problems and could not be solved, leading to large cancellations of orders? What if one or two planes\ncrashed due to problems that previously had not been anticipated? Given everything I knew, the chances that the 787 program\nwould have to be abandoned appeared tiny, but what would the consequences be? One consequence would be a very serious blow\nto Boeing\u2019s reputation. However, the cash charges of canceling the program likely would not be large relative to the strength of\nBoeing\u2019s balance sheet. And the 787 was projected to account for only about 18 percent of Boeing\u2019s revenues and 4 to 5 percent of\nits earnings in 2015. The price of Boeing\u2019s shares might fall sharply upon the announcement ofa very serious 787 problem, but the\ncompany still would have estimated 2015 non-GAAP earnings in excess of $7.50 per share, and thus there appeared to be a large\n\nmargin of safety for shareholders who paid about $75 for the shares.\n\nIn December 2012 and early January 2013, we established a large position in Boeing\u2019s shares. On January 7, at a time we were still\npurchasing shares, a battery caught fire in an empty 787 parked at Logan Airport. Then, on January 16, an ANA-owned 787 made\nan emergency landing after one of its batteries caught fire. After the second fire, the FAA ordered the grounding of all 787s, and the\n\nprice of Boeing\u2019s shares immediately fell by 3.4 percent to $74.34.\n\nOn Thursday, January 17, I received a telephone call from an investment manager. He was selling his holdings in Boeing because\nhe was fearful that, if serious problems developed with the 787, his clients would criticize him for unwisely sticking with\nBoeing after there had been warning signs about the reliability of the plane. I tried to convince the manager that, even if the 787\ndid develop serious lasting problems, Boeing still had a thriving business producing other models, and therefore there was a\nlarge margin of safety in the shares. My analysis fell on deaf ears, and the other manager sold all his holdings. Most investment\nmanagers adopt two goals: (1) to earn a good return on their holdings and (2) to keep their clients happy. I have only one goal: to\nearn high returns. If I earn high returns (without taking large risks of permanent loss), then my clients likely will be happy. If a\nclient is not happy because of any ill-determined reason, then I am happy if the client chooses to leave Greenhaven for another\n\nmanager.\n\f"}, "003717.png": {"text": "During February and March 2012, Boeing worked to enclose the lithium-ion batteries on the 787 so that any future fires could\n\nnot damage parts of the plane exterior to the enclosures. This plan seemed to satisfy the FAA, and on April 19, the FAA lifted its\ngrounding order. The price of Boeing\u2019s shares hit a nadir on January 29 at $73.65, remained in the mid-$70s during February, and\nthen started appreciating in March, when it appeared that the battery problem would be solved. On April 19, the shares closed\n\nat $87.96. Six months later, the shares sold at $122.52. The investment manager who sold his shares in mid-January at about\n\n$75 made a large mistake. The way I look at it, in the investment business, there are risks in owning securities, but there also are\nrisks in not owning securities that have favorable risk-to-reward profiles. The risks in not owning undervalued securities are the\nopportunity costs. An extreme example would be an investment manager who purchased only Treasury bills for his clients. After\nadjusting for taxes and inflation, clients who own only Treasury bills would, over time, experience large erosions in their real\nwealth. However, if the investment manager had purchased Boeing\u2019s shares for his clients, the clients would have earned large\nprofits that would serve to protect their original capital against losses on any future unprofitable investments. If an investor turns\na $75 initial investment into $122, then the investor could absorb $47 of future losses before being underwater on his original $75\n\ninvestment. Sometimes the best defense is a sensible offense.\n\nBoeing's shares continued to move higher in the fall of 2013 and finished the year at $136. By now, Wall Street generally believed\nthat the 787 program would be successful and that Boeing would enjoy rising earnings and large cash flows that could be used to\nrepurchase shares. We believed that a large percentage of the company\u2019s intermediate-term potential now had been discounted\n\ninto the price of the shares, and we started to reduce the size of our holding.\n\nIemphasize that I like to invest in strong and growing companies, such as Boeing, whose shares are temporarily depressed\n\nby understandable and solvable problems. However, I usually shy from investing in weak companies that are suffering from\nproblems that stem from their weakness. Managements of weak companies often announce plans to improve earnings and other\nfundamentals, but my experience is that turning around entire companies usually is a difficult process that rarely meets with\n\nsatisfactory success.\n\f"}, "003718.png": {"text": "12\nSOUTHWEST AIRLINES\n\nAugust 2012. Josh was smiling broadly as he entered my office and said: \u201cI have an idea that you will have a hard time liking. In\n\nfact, you will hate it. You might end up throwing me out of your office\u2014forever. My idea is an airline. It is Southwest Airlines.\u201d\n\nJosh was correct. I knew that the airlines were a terrible business. Among the worst. When an airplane flies from one city to\nanother, the labor, fuel, and other costs of operating the plane are almost the same whether the plane is 100 percent filled with\npaying passengers, or 50 percent filled, or empty. Therefore, airlines have particularly large financial incentives to fill as many\nseats as possible. Because many passengers will choose a flight solely based on the price of the ticket, airlines historically try to\nfill seats by offering the lowest prices. The result has been severe price competition between airlines\u2014in fact, destructive price\ncompetition. So destructive that the aggregate profits of the airline industry since the days of the Wright Brothers have been\n\nalmost nonexistent.\n\nFurthermore, the airline business is highly capital intensive because airplanes are expensive to purchase or lease. With low or\nno profits, most airlines have needed to borrow heavily to purchase aircraft, and thus most have balance sheets that are highly\n\nleveraged with debt or lease obligations.\n\nDuring periods of weakness, many airlines have been unable to service their high debt loads or lease obligations and have been\nforced into bankruptcy, and many have simply disappeared, including Pan Am (1927-1991), TWA (1925-2001), Eastern (1926-\n1991), and Braniff (1928-1982). According to Wikipedia, between 1979 and 2011, fifty-two U.S. airlines filed for bankruptcy.\n\f"}, "003719.png": {"text": "Amazing! As Warren Buffett wrote in his 2007 annual report to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders: \u201cIndeed, if a farsighted\n\ncapitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.\u201d\n\nThe years 2001 through 2011 were particularly miserable for the airline industry. The sharp drop in travel after 9/11 was followed\nbya sharp increase in fuel costs and then by another sharp drop in travel during the 2008-2010 recession. Most of the large U.S.\nairlines incurred sizable losses in the 2000s and struggled to survive. United Airlines declared bankruptcy in 2002, Delta and\n\nNorthwest in 2005, American in 2011.\n\nJosh believed that the miserable conditions in the 2000s would trigger a period of prosperity for the airlines. Here\u2019s why. Airlines\nsuffering large losses do not have the financial incentives or financial wherewithal to purchase many new airplanes. If fact, they\nhave incentives to reduce costs by selling their less efficient planes. And that is exactly what happened between the years 2000\nand 2011, with the result that the effective capacity of the domestic airlines declined by 3.1 percent from 701.5 billion seat-miles\nto 679.5 billion seat-miles. And during the same 11-year period that capacity declined by 3.1 percent, the demand for domestic\nair travel, largely driven by population growth, increased by 12.4 percent from 502.3 billion seat-miles to 564.7 billion. Asa\nresult, whereas the average flight in 2000 operated at 71.6 percent capacity, the average flight in 2011 operated at 83.1 percent of\n\ncapacity.\n\nBecause most flights that depart at unpopular hours or that fly to less popular locations do so with many empty seats, if the entire\nairline industry operates at 83.1 percent of capacity, then many of the more popular flights will operate at full capacity\u2014and many\n\nwith wait lists.\n\nJosh\u2019s thesis was that capacity would continue to tighten because relatively few new airplanes were on order by the domestic\ncarriers. He believed that, as capacity tightened further, the domestic carriers would be able to increase their prices and that the\n\nincreased prices would lead to much higher profits and much higher share prices for the airlines.\n\f"}, "003720.png": {"text": "At the time Josh entered my office, Southwest Airlines\u2019 shares were selling at only a touch above their book value of $8.34. Unlike\nalmost any other domestic airline, Southwest had been continuously profitable for decades and had as much cash as debt. The\ncompany had earned an excellent reputation as a well-managed and highly reliable low-cost carrier. Amazingly, Southwest was\nthe fourth most admired company in the whole world, according to Fortune magazine\u2019s 2011 survey. Southwest was ahead of\nProcter & Gamble (the fifth most admired company), Coca-Cola (#6), Amazon (#7), FedEx (#8), and Microsoft (#9). The only other\n\nairline that made Fortune's top 50 list was Singapore Airlines at #18.\n\nSouthwest Airlines was incorporated by Herb Kelleher and Rollin King on March 15, 1967, as Air Southwest Company. The initial\nplan was to fly only between three major cities in Texas: Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. Kelleher, who was the leader of the two\nfounders, believed that by being an intrastate carrier within Texas, Air Southwest could avoid burdensome federal regulations.\nHowever, litigation delayed the start-up of the new airline when Braniff, Continental Airlines, and Trans-Texas sued to block the\naddition of a new competitor. The suit labored in the Texas courts for more than two years, but in late 1970, the Texas Supreme\nCourt upheld Air Southwest\u2019s rights to form a regional airline. In March 1971, Air Southwest changed its name to Southwest\nAirlines, and three months later the brand new airline commenced service between Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio with three\n\n(soon four) Boeing 737s.\n\nFrom inception, Herb Kelleher decided to model Southwest after Pacific Southwest Airlines, a California-based regional carrier\nthat was founded in 1949. Pacific Southwest was the first major carrier to offer discount fares. In addition, it attempted to attract\ncustomers by making flying fun. Flight attendants and pilots were encouraged to joke with passengers. In the 1960s, the flight\nattendants\u2019 uniforms included miniskirts\u2014and in the 1970s, when fashions changed, hot pants. The company painted a smile\n\non the nose of each of its planes. Keeping with the desired ethos of the company, Pacific Southwest\u2019s founder, Ken Friedkin, wore\nbrightly colored Hawaiian shirts. Pacific Southwest's slogan was \u201cThe World\u2019s Friendliest Airline,\u201d and the friendliness worked and\n\nattracted paying customers.\n\f"}, "003721.png": {"text": "While potential competitors normally are not friendly to each other, Ken Friedkin seemed flattered that Herb Kelleher was\ninterested in copying Pacific Southwest\u2019s business model and generously agreed to help train some of Southwest\u2019s repair\n\nmechanics and to offer Southwest flight, operating, and training manuals.\n\nKelleher selected Love Field in Dallas for the company\u2019s headquarters and adopted the word \u201clove\u201d as the company\u2019s motto for\nearly advertisements. Beverages served to passengers were known as \u201clove potions\u201d and peanuts as \u201clove bites.\u201d The company\nstock ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange was LUV. A committee formed to select flight attendants included an\nindividual who had selected the attendants for Hugh Hefner\u2019s Playboy airplane. The flight attendants selected by the committee\nwere described as cheerleaders, majorettes, or long-legged dancers with outgoing personalities. Herb Kelleher dressed them in hot\n\npants and go-go boots. Clearly, Southwest was closely following Pacific Southwest\u2019s offbeat, fun, and successful model.\n\nIt is difficult to start up a new airline. Passengers usually feel safer flying with an established carrier that has a track record for\nreliability and safety. Southwest had difficulty attracting passengers in 1971 and 1972 and was unprofitable\u2014so unprofitable that\nthe company had to sell one of its four 737s to meet its payroll and other expenses. To compensate for the loss of 25 percent of its\ncapacity, Southwest found ways to substantially reduce the time each remaining airplane remained on the ground between flights.\n\nThis was the start of a concerted effort by Kelleher to model Southwest into a highly efficient, very low-cost carrier.\n\nWith low costs, low ticket prices, and a \u201clove\u201d business model, Southwest started to become successful by the mid-1970s. Its\nrevenues in 1975 grew to $23 million, up from $15 million in 1974 and $9 million in 1973. The company about broke even in\n1973, was in the black in 1974, and earned $3.4 million after taxes in 1975. The profitability permitted Southwest to purchase\nadditional aircraft. By 1978, the company operated 13 Boeing 737s that serviced 11 Texas cities. Revenues and after-tax profits in\n\n1978 were $81 and $17 million. Southwest Airlines was on the map.\n\nIn 1978, the airline industry became largely deregulated, and Southwest decided to expand outside of Texas. Its first interstate\n\nflight was from Houston to New Orleans on January 25, 1979. During the next two years, buoyed by the success of its low-cost,\n\f"}, "003722.png": {"text": "low-fare strategy, Southwest continued gradually to expand its service to additional cities. By 1980, the company was servicing 14\ncities. Its revenues and after-tax profits in 1980 increased to $213 million and $29 million. In its 1980 annual report, management\nstated that the company\u2019s \u201cunique combination of low fares, frequent service on short-haul routes, exemplary employee\nproductivity, and high utilization of its assets\u201d had saved its passengers substantial sums of money and, at the same time, had\n\u201cachieved the highest operating profit margin of any domestic air carrier and had achieved, over the past five years, an annual\n\nreturn on stockholder equity of 37%.\u201d\n\nDuring the next 20 years, Southwest continued to grow rapidly, partially due to the expansion of its network to most major cities\nin the United States, partially due to its low costs and fares, and partially due to its innovation and good management. Between\n1980 and 2000, the company\u2019s revenues increased at a 16.6 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from $213 million to\n$4,628 million, and its net earnings increased at a 16.5 percent CAGR from $28.4 million to $603.1 million. To remain low cost\nduring the two decades, Southwest stressed simplicity. To reduce maintenance and training costs, it owned and flew only one\nmodel of aircraft: Boeing 737s. To avoid congestion, it used smaller airports, in Dallas preferring Love Field to DFW and in Chicago\npreferring Midway to O\u2019Hare. To save booking costs, Southwest was one of the first airlines to sell tickets over the Internet and\n\nto issue ticketless tickets. Also, passengers were not able to reserve assigned seats, but instead selected their own seats on a first-\ncome, first-serve basis upon boarding an aircraft. To further reduce costs, the company built its own computerized reservation\nsystem. If you are in a commodity business, the winners are those with the lowest costs\u2014and Southwest had very low costs and\n\nwas a winner.\n\nThe following story is instructive of Herb Kelleher\u2019s inventiveness and style. In March 1992, shortly after Southwest started using\nthe motto \u201cJust Plane Smart,\u201d Stevens Aviation Inc., a company that maintained aircraft and that had been using the \u201cJust Plane\nSmart\u201d motto for a number of years, threatened to sue Southwest for violating its trademark. After some discussions, instead\n\nof a lawsuit, Herb Kelleher and Stevens's CEO Kurt Herwald decided to settle the argument though an arm-wrestling match at\n\nthe Dallas Sportatorium wrestling arena. A promotional video was created that showed the CEO\u2019s \u201ctraining\u201d for the match. In\n\f"}, "003723.png": {"text": "the video, Herb Kelleher is shown being aided by an assistant as he attempts a sit-up. A bottle of Wild Turkey whiskey waits as a\nreward for each completed sit-up. There were three rounds to the arm-wrestling match. The loser of each round had to pay $5,000\ntoa charity of his choice. The winner of two out of the three rounds gained use of the \u201cJust Plane Smart\u201d trademark. Kurt Herwald\nwon two out of the three rounds, but he immediately granted co-use of \u201cJust Plane Smart\u201d to Southwest. The result of the arm-\nwrestling match was that both companies could use the trademark, charities received $15,000, and both companies received\n\nexcellent publicity.\n\nBy 2011, Southwest's revenues had increased to more than $15 billion, but during the 2001-2011 period, the carrier\u2019s earnings per\nshare (EPS) declined from a peak of $0.79 in 2000 to only $0.40 in 2011. Increased fuel costs and the soft economy were the causes\n\nof the sharp decline in earnings.\n\nIn August 2012, when Josh entered my office, Wall Street generally was unenthusiastic about the outlook for Southwest, and no\n\u2018Wall Street analyst was predicting a several-fold increase in EPS due to improved pricing. On July 19, the day after Southwest\nannounced its results for the June quarter, several analysts issued reports on the company. The shares were trading at about $9.15\nat the time. Goldman Sachs predicted that the company\u2019s EPS would increase to $0.99 in 2014 and valued the shares at $8.50.\nMerrill Lynch projected that EPS would increase to $1.20 in 2014 and valued the shares at $9.50. Barclays was more optimistic. It\nprojected that EPS would increase to $1.35 in 2014 and that the shares were worth $14. Josh, however, believed that if his thesis\non pricing proved correct, earnings could soar far above Wall Street\u2019s estimates. His logic was as follows. The company\u2019s revenues\nin 2012 were expected to be about $16 billion. For every 1 percent increase in ticket prices, Southwest\u2019s pretax earnings would\nincrease by $160 million and its net earnings would increase by about $0.13 per share, assuming an effective tax rate of 39 percent\nand a diluted share count of 745 million. Josh believed that as the demand for domestic air travel continued to approach capacity,\nticket prices could increase by at least 4 to 5 percent per year, or 2 to 3 percent above assumed cost increases of about 2 percent of\n\nrevenues. If real prices increased by 2 to 3 percent per year for four years, then the price increases would add $1.04 to $1.56 to EPS\n\f"}, "003724.png": {"text": "by 2016. Furthermore, Southwest recently had announced a profit improvement program that was projected to increase annual\n\npretax earnings by $1,100 million by the end of 2015. The $1,100 million was composed of three pieces:\n\n1. The company had just acquired AirTrans, another regional carrier. The annual synergistic savings of integrating AirTrans into\n\nSouthwest were estimated at $400 million.\n\nN\n\n. In addition, AirTrans flew a number of inefficient Boeing 717s. Transitioning the 717s to another carrier would save about $200\n\nmillion per year.\n\nw\n\n. Finally, Southwest had found a way to add an additional row of six seats to its 737-800s. The extra row of seats, anew\nreservations system, and other operational improvements together were expected to add about $500 million to annual pretax\n\nprofits.\n\nThe $1,100 million profit program, if successful, would add about $0.90 to earnings by 2016. Based on these estimates and\nassumptions, Josh concluded that there was a reasonable possibility that Southwest\u2019s EPS could increase from about $0.60 in 2012\nto more than $2 in 2015 and to more than $2.50 in 2016, before other considerations. And there were two other considerations.\nThe first was normal demand growth over the next several years. The second was that Southwest, which had as much cash as debt\nand which was generating large amounts of excess cash, had established an aggressive share repurchase plan. Josh estimated that\nthe repurchase plan could reduce the diluted number of shares outstanding from 774 million in 2011 to materially below 700\nmillion in 2016. Josh commented that the growth in demand and the share repurchase plan were icing on an already delicious\ncake, and they gave him some extra confidence that if prices increased by 4 to 5 percent per year, Southwest\u2019s EPS could exceed\n\n$2.50in 2016.\n\nJosh then used a second methodology to check the reasonableness of his projections. He estimated that Southwest\u2019s revenues\nwould grow to about $19.5 billion by 2016. During the three years before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Southwest\u2019s operating profit\n\nmargins ranged between 16.4 percent and 18.1 percent. Josh reasoned that if he were correct that industry conditions would turn\n\f"}, "003725.png": {"text": "strong, Southwest\u2019s profit margins could return to the 16 to 18 percent level, and thus its operating profits in 2016 could be in\nthe range of $3,200 to $3,500 million.

For example, on June 30, 2012, Delta had\n$8.8 billion of net debt and a tangible book value of negative $11.0 billion. United had $4.3 billion of net debt and a tangible book\nvalue of negative $3.3 billion. American was in bankruptcy. Southwest, by comparison, had no net debt and had a tangible book\nvalue of a positive $5.9 billion. Josh believed that if the airline industry hit an unexpected bump, such as a spike in fuel prices, a\nterrorist attack, or a sharp recession, the airlines with the precarious balance sheets might be forced into real or quasi bankruptcy,\nwith the result that their shareholders might suffer material permanent losses. Josh believed that Delta\u2019s and United\u2019s shares\n\npossibly had even more upside potential than Southwest\u2019s, but they were not for us. Greenhaven hates permanent loss.\n\nJosh attempted to value Southwest\u2019s shares. What was the value of a gem of a company in a miserable feast-or-famine business?\nJosh did not have the foggiest idea. Neither did I. We did not have a reasonable approach to valuing the shares. However, we did\n\nnot need to. If Southwest earned anything close to $2.50 per share in 2016, the shares likely would appreciate sharply\u2014possibly\nseveral-fold from the present price of about $9. And, equally important, the company\u2019s quality and balance sheet would provide\n\nconsiderable protection against permanent loss. We thought we had a winner\u2014a possible home run.\n\nJosh set up a telephone call with Tammy Romo, Southwest's chief financial officer. We peppered Tammy with questions, trying\nto find a hole in our analysis. We did not find a hole. In fact, the more we learned and thought about Southwest, the more we\n\nconcluded that its reward-to-risk ratio was particularly favorable\u2014in fact, compelling.\n\f"}, "003726.png": {"text": "So, I did not throw Josh out of my office, but instead soon started purchasing Southwest\u2019s shares. If you had asked me a year\nearlier whether Greenhaven ever was likely to own shares of an airline, I would have said, \u201cNo way.\u201d But I believe that investors\nsometimes need to be open to new ideas that challenge previous convictions. In the investment business, as in life, one becomes\n\ndisadvantaged if one develops tunnel vision.\n\nSoon after we established a position in Southwest, I told my 15-year-old grandson Grant about the purchase. Grant was 6 feet 1\ninch tall and had the frame of a football player, which he was. Grant had an immediate adverse reaction to Southwest: \u201cEddie (all\nmy grandchildren call me by my nickname), Southwest\u2019s seats are cramped, and you must arrive at the gate at least an hour early\nto get a decent seat; I call the airline Southworst.\u201d Well, most passengers are not football players and, unlike Grant, most have to pay\n\ntheir own fares and therefore appreciate the airline\u2019s low discount prices, even if they cannot reserve a seat ahead of time.\n\nThe price of Southwest's shares started appreciating sharply soon after we started establishing our position. Sometimes it\n\ntakes years before one of our holdings starts to appreciate sharply\u2014and sometimes we are lucky with our timing. In the case\n\nof Southwest, we were lucky. The stock market turned strong in early 2013, and some investors became optimistic about the\nintermediate-term outlook for the airline industry. Most of the Wall Street firms, however, still were not projecting that the\nairlines would be able to sharply increase their prices and earnings. For example, between the fall of 2012 and the spring of 2013,\nGoldman Sachs\u2019s analysts slightly decreased their 2014 EPS estimate for Southwest from $0.99 to $0.95. On October 7, 2013, while\nGoldman\u2019s analysts wrote that they were encouraged by Southwest\u2019s present pricing discipline, they increased their 2014 EPS\nestimate by only a few cents to $0.98. Then, on October 24, Southwest announced that the company had earned $0.34 per share\nin the third quarter of 2013, up 161 percent from $0.13 in the comparable 2012 quarter. Virtually all of the large increase in EPS\nwas due to price increases. According to our calculations, prices per revenue passenger mile increased by 8.6 percent if one adjusts\nfor changes in the price of jet fuel. On the day of the earnings release, Goldman finally started to get the message and increased\n\nits 2014 EPS to $1.12. The price of Southwest's shares rose 3.7 percent on the day of the release, and the shares now were selling\n\nat about twice the price they were selling at on the day Josh first walked into my office with a broad smile and the idea. Goldman.\n\f"}, "003727.png": {"text": "and most other Wall Street firms had failed to predict that ticket prices would increase sharply due to a tightening market. In\nmy opinion, Goldman\u2019s analysts had been so focused on Southwest\u2019s recent developments that they had failed to step back and\ncorrectly analyze and predict the critical fundamentals that would determine the intermediate-term price of Southwest\u2019s shares.\n\nThey had become reporters of recent news, not analysts.\n\nOn with the story. In the fourth quarter of 2013, Southwest\u2019s ticket prices increased by 6.4 percent (again, adjusted for the price\nof jet fuel), and ticket prices continued to increase at favorable rates in early 2014. By the spring of 2014, Wall Street generally had\nbecome more aware of the new momentum in prices and profitability. Common EPS estimates for 2014 had increased to about\n$1.50, but most firms still were projecting only modest EPS gains after 2014. Goldman Sachs, for example, was projecting $1.50\nfor 2014, $1.72 for 2015, and $1.86 for 2016. Josh believed that if $1.50 was the correct estimate for 2014, then normal annual\ngrowth, plus the $1,100 million profit improvement, plus share repurchases would result in 2016 EPS far above Goldman\u2019s $1.86\nbefore any additional price increases\u2014and he thought it logical that the domestic airlines would continue to increase ticket prices\n\nas the market continued to tighten.\n\nIn late spring, Josh, Chris, and I spent considerable time thinking about our investment in Southwest. At the time, the shares were\nselling at $25 to $26. We tried to estimate what the shares would be worth in a year or two, but we ended up being befuddled.\n\nWe had no methodology to estimate what the company\u2019s earnings would be in a normal environment. The airline business had\nbeen a feast-or-famine (and mostly famine) business, and there had been almost no periods of normalcy. Moreover, while we had\nmethodologies to value excellent companies in excellent businesses and excellent companies in mediocre businesses, we did not\n\nhave an approach to value an excellent company in an absolutely miserable business.\n\nFinally, we decided to sell about half of our holdings in Southwest. The shares had appreciated by far more than our other holdings,\nand thus they had become too large a percentage of our portfolios given the normal unattractiveness of the airline business.

I screened lists of stocks, thought about\nvarious industries that might be attractive, read magazines and newspapers, brainstormed with my associates, and reviewed lists\nof stocks recently purchased by other investment managers.1 But frustration was my companion. I could not find an attractive\n\nidea. I looked and looked and looked, but to no avail.\n\nThen, on Friday, May 30, I noticed that the cover and lead story in the latest edition of Bloomberg magazine was about the three\nco-heads of Goldman Sachs\u2019s investment banking business: David Solomon, Richard Gnodde, and John S. Weinberg. I had worked\nwith John Weinberg\u2019s grandfather, Sidney Weinberg, in 1966 and 1967, and had known John S\u2019\u2019s father, John L. Weinberg, who\nhad been the co-senior partner of Goldman Sachs for many years. I decided to read the story, largely for entertainment. The article\n\nemphasized the strength and profitability of Goldman's investment banking operations.\n\nOut of curiosity, I went to my Bloomberg terminal and looked up Goldman's share price: $159.80. I then looked up the company\u2019s\ntangible book valuez per share: $145.04. Flash through the mind! Goldman was a premier company that was selling at only a 10\npercent premium to its tangible book value. Second flash through the mind! Goldman had two businesses that required very little\ncapital (investment banking and investment management) and two businesses that required considerable capital (\u201ctrading\u201d and\ninvesting). By calculating what the non-capital-intensive businesses should earn in a normal environment and by estimating that\nthe capital-intensive businesses should be earning more than a 10 percent return on equity,3 I could estimate Goldman\u2019s earnings\n\npower. Thus, I had an approach to modeling the company\u2019s earnings.\n\f"}, "003730.png": {"text": "I downloaded the company\u2019s recent income statements. The non-capital- intensive businesses were earning $5+ per share after\ntaxes in what appeared to be a somewhat subnormal environment for the businesses. I estimated that $4 of Goldman\u2019s book value\nshould be allocated to the non-capital-intensive activities and therefore that the remaining $141 per share should be allocated to\ntrading and investing. Thus, I concluded that the earnings power of trading and investing should be more than $14 per share and\nthat the earnings power of the whole company should be about $20 per share, which works out to approximately a 14 percent\nreturn on tangible book value. When I project estimates and returns, I think about the reasonableness of the estimates. Do they\nseem realistic? In this case, my conclusion that Goldman\u2019s earnings power should be about 14 percent of its tangible book value\n\nmade a great deal of sense to me. Much of investing is about reasonability, common sense, and judgment.\n\nWhen valuing companies, we usually look out two years to the future. If Goldman\u2019s earnings power was about $20 now, its\nearnings power certainly should be at least $22 by 2016 (the financial markets tend to grow at a 5 to 6 percent annual rate). I then\nthought about a deserved price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. The non-capital-intensive businesses were gems that should be wortha\nhigher-than-average PE ratio. However, trading and investing were less attractive business lines that likely were worth less than\nan average PE ratio. On balance, I decided to value Goldman\u2019s shares at 12 to 15 times their earnings power. Therefore, an early and\npreliminary conclusion was that Goldman\u2019s shares could be worth $265 to $330 by 2016, or 65 to 105 percent above their present\nprice. I finally had a possible idea.\n\nI was excited. I dropped everything else I was doing and started reading Goldman\u2019s Form 10-K. I particularly was looking for\ninformation that was counter to my initial analysis that the company\u2019s shares were materially undervalued. I spent considerable\ntime reading about pending litigation, which mainly stemmed from alleged unethical trades and other actions made prior to\n\nthe 2008-2009 financial crisis. We generally shy away from investing in companies whose ethical standards are questionable,\n\nbut I was convinced that the ethical lapses at Goldman were the doings of a relatively small percentage of the company\u2019s 32,000\nemployees\u2014and that the firm itself should not be faulted for the mal-advice given and the mal-transactions enacted by a relatively\n\nsmall number of its employees. It would be unreasonable to assume that any firm could hire 32,000 employees that did not\n\f"}, "003731.png": {"text": "include some bad actors. In my opinion, one should be careful not to condemn an entire organization for the immoral or illegal\n\nactions of a few.\n\nNext, I studied Goldman\u2019s balance sheet. After the financial crisis, the company decided to materially deleverage itself. In 2007,\nGoldman\u2019s assets were 26 times as large as its shareholders\u2019 equity. By the end of 2013, the ratio had declined to less than 12 times.\nI then tried to analyze the quality of the balance sheet, but this was difficult to do, partially because the assets owned by Goldman\ncan change day to day. However, I did feel comfortable knowing that, as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, Goldman\u2019s financial\nstrength continually was being scrutinized by many regulatory bodies. Also, the Federal Reserve Bank had permitted Goldman\n\nto reacquire $6.2 billion of its shares in 2013, after reacquiring $4.6 billion in 2012 and $6.0 billion 2011. I believed that the Fed\nwould not have permitted these large repurchases if the governors and their staff did not feel highly confident about the strength\nof Goldman\u2019s balance sheet. The Fed can make a mistake. No business decision can be based on assuredly accurate information\u2014\nand situations can change. But in an imperfect world, the scrutiny of the Fed still was an important consideration when analyzing\n\nthe risks of owning Goldman\u2019s shares.\n\nFurthermore, while I always have been concerned about asset quality after a long period of prosperity because continuing\nprosperity often breeds overconfidence and resulting misassessments of risks, the reverse also should be true. After a scary\n\nfinancial crisis and a deep recession, managements usually are prone to be particularly risk averse.\n\nA large segment of Goldman's 10-K dealt with the increased regulation on investment banks. Many on Wall Street viewed the\nincreased regulation as a negative. But I also saw it as a silver lining. The sharply increased capital requirements likely would\ncause weaker and less profitable firms to withdraw from some lines of business, thus reducing competition. Also, the costs of\ncomplying with Dodd-Frank and the other regulations would serve as large barriers to entry for possible new competitors. Thus,\nan unintended consequence of Dodd-Frank was to stifle competition and to increase the power and market shares of the large,\n\nwell-capitalized financial institutions.\n\f"}, "003732.png": {"text": "After reading the 10-K, immediately convened a meeting with Greenhaven\u2019s two other analysts: my son, Chris, and Josh\nSandbulte. The three of us spent the next two hours discussing the pros and cons of Goldman Sachs\u2019s businesses. We\nbrainstormed. Our conclusions were that Goldman was a very strong company in a reasonably attractive industry and that the\ncompany\u2019s shares were trading at a deeply undervalued and undeserved level. We reasoned that the shares were depressed because\nmany investors generally remained concerned about the balance sheet risks of financial service companies and because many\nwere concerned that the industry would become overregulated. We believed that these concerns were overblown and would\n\nmitigate with time. They were our opportunity.\n\nI was amused that Goldman Sachs earned $15.46 per share in 2013, up sharply from $5.87 per share 10 years earlier. During the\n10-year period, the company had suffered through the worst financial crisis and the worst recession since the Great Depression\nand through hostile litigation and hostile legislation, and yet the company\u2019s profits had increased by 163 percent. My experience\nis that analysts and historians often dwell too much on a company\u2019s recent problems and underplay its strengths, progress, and\npromise. An analogy might be the progress of the United States during the twentieth century. At the end of the century, U.S.\ncitizens generally were far wealthier, healthier, safer, and better educated than at the start of the century. In fact, the century\n\nwas one of extraordinary progress. Yet most history books tend to mainly focus on the two tragic world wars, the highly\nunpopular Vietnam War, the Great Depression, the civil unrest during the Civil Rights movement, and the often poor leadership\nin Washington. The century was littered with severe problems and mistakes. If you only had read the newspapers and the history\nbooks, you likely would have concluded that the United States had suffered a century of relative and absolute decline. But the\n\nUnited States actually exited the century strong and prosperous. So also did Goldman exit 2013 strong and prosperous.\n\nBloomberg archives many presentations made by managements. I wanted to hear what Goldman\u2019s management was saying\npublicly, so I listened to about 10 recent presentations. I was particularly intrigued by comments made on May 30, 2013, by Gary\nCohn, Goldman\u2019s president and chief operating officer. Cohn stated that, in spite of a challenging environment in 2012, Goldman\n\nhad been able to earn a 10.7 percent return on its equity (ROE). He added: \u201cWe are focused on positioning the firm to further\n\f"}, "003733.png": {"text": "expand our ROE... as the operating environment improves.\u201d He elaborated on \u201copportunities we see to drive returns higher over\nthe medium term.\u201d One driver was revenues. Cohn pointed out that investment banking revenues had been cyclically low in recent\nyears\u2014and a return to normal activities would give revenues and earnings a major boost. He added that Goldman also had the\nopportunity to gain market share in investment banking because a number of competitors were retrenching in the wake of the\nfinancial crisis and in reaction to resulting increased regulation and higher capital requirements. Cohn emphasized: \u201cYou do not\n\nneed a significant amount of retrenchment to create an important revenue opportunity for us.\u201d\n\nCohn also emphasized that Goldman\u2019s cost reductions should add to earnings. He stated that the company recently had completed\na $1.9 billion cost reduction program and that the firm\u2019s compensation expense as a percentage of revenues had materially\n\ndeclined over the past few years.\n\nGary Cohn made another point that sparked my imagination. He stated that Goldman \u201cwill continue to adjust and reallocate\nresources to maximize efficiency as necessary; we have a culture of adaptability.\u201d My thought was that, if one area of Goldman\u2019s\nactivities was producing subnormal returns, the company could remove capital from that area in favor of another area that was\nproducing high returns. This flexibility is a positive attribute of many financial service companies. Manufacturing companies,\nhowever, often are saddled with poorly designed or poorly located plants. If labor costs in Brazil become materially lower than\nlabor costs in Alabama, it would be nearly impossible for a paper company to pick up a paper mill located in Alabama and ship it to\n\nBrazil.\n\nGoldman's presentations generally exuded a calm confidence in the company\u2019s future. Their content signaled that management\nwas aggressive and ambitious, but not arrogant. I realized that the presentations were carefully scripted, but nonetheless I was\n\nfavorably impressed.\n\nI then telephoned three acquaintances who had been high-level executives at Goldman. Each had similar impressions:\n\nmanagement was excellent; the younger employees tended to be among the best and the brightest; bright and ambitious\n\f"}, "003734.png": {"text": "employees will find ways to make money for themselves and for the firm; and the firm continued to enjoy the best brand image in\n\nthe business.\n\nExperience builds intuition, and my intuition was to start purchasing shares in Goldman. The concept, the fundamentals, and\nthe profit potential seemed compelling. Mr. Arthur Ross frequently counseled me that \u201cwe are not a debating society; we are not a\ndebating society; act, Ed, act.\u201d So I acted\u2014and placed an order to buy shares of Goldman Sachs. Within a few weeks, we purchased a\n\nfull position in the shares.\n\nAbout a month later, I had lunch with Will Gordon, an investment manager at a medium-sized firm. I told Will that our Goldman\nidea was a godsend because we were having difficulty finding new ideas post the strong stock market in 2013. I also mentioned\nthat our portfolios had appreciated substantially more than the market in 2013 and that we now had more than $5 billion under\nmanagement and needed to find stocks that we could purchase in size, such as Goldman. I added that, given the level of the stock\nmarket and given our increased size, it was a challenge to keep our portfolios appreciating at buoyant rates. Will\u2019s immediate\ncomment was, \u201cWell, Ed, I guess you will have to settle for lower returns in the future.\u201d I had an immediate immensely adverse\nreaction to Will\u2019s comment\u2014and especially to the use of the word settle.

Yes, investing $5 billion at a time when the stock market is relatively fully valued is a challenge. But there are two disparate\nmind-sets to the word challenge. One is the frustration of encountering an apparently impenetrable wall. The other is the thrill and\nsatisfaction of climbing the wall. To each his own, but I relish the latter. And say hogwash to \u201csettling\u201d for lower returns in the\n\nfuture.\n\nOn a bright day in the fall of 2014, I received an invitation to have a breakfast meeting with Abebayo (\u201cBayo\u201d) Ogunlesi, the lead\ndirector of Goldman\u2019s board of directors. The main purpose of the breakfast was to discuss the company\u2019s governance. I readily\naccepted the invitation. On the appointed day, I arrived at Goldman's West Street headquarters about 45 minutes early. I believe\nthat it is rude to be late to meetings, so I normally allow too much time for travel, fearing that a train will be late or that I will have\ndifficulty hailing a cab. It is a Wachenheim idiosyncrasy. One of many. Usually when I am early, I kill time with a cup of coffee or\na walk around the neighborhood. However, on this occasion, I made good use of the 45 spare minutes. I took an express elevator\nto Goldman\u2019s 11th floor, which serves as a sky lobby. Most of Goldman\u2019s employees change elevators on the 11th floor, and many\ncome to grab a cup of coffee or a snack at the floor\u2019s cafeteria. I found a comfortable chair, and for a good part of the 45 minutes,\nI people watched. By studying how Goldman\u2019s employees communicate with each other, dress, and walk, I could get some sense\nof the type of people who work for the company. And I was impressed. The employees generally were friendly toward each\nother, smiley, neatly dressed, and seemingly intent upon their purpose. And I was impressed by the 11th floor itself, which was\nfunctionally laid out, elegant, in good taste, and definitely not gold plated. While it is dangerous to judge a book by its cover, Ido\n\nfind it useful to observe a company\u2019s employees and offices.\n\nA few minutes before the scheduled 9:00 a.m. breakfast meeting with Bayo Ogunlesi, I took an elevator to one of the top floors of\nthe headquarters building and was escorted to Goldman\u2019s boardroom. Just inside the boardroom, a spread of bagels, fruits, orange\n\njuice, and coffee was laid out on a cart. No eggs any way you like them. No bacon. No pancakes or French toast. And no waiters\n\f"}, "003736.png": {"text": "dressed in tuxedos. Just a simple, self-service breakfast. My favorable impression of Goldman Sachs increased by another notch.\n\nGoldman was not trying to impress its guests with opulence.\n\nBayo\u2019s background is amazing. Born in the small rural village of Makun, Nigeria, he attended high school at Kings College in Lagos\nand then left Nigeria to attend Oxford. After receiving a BA at Oxford, he attended both Harvard Business School and Harvard\nLaw School at the same time and, along with a classmate, became one of the first two students of African descent to become an\neditor of the Harvard Law Review. After receiving his LLB in 1979, Bayo clerked for Thurgood Marshall, becoming the first non-\nAmerican ever to clerk at the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1983, Bayo joined Cravath, Swaine & Moore in New York City, but after several\nmonths practicing law, Credit Suisse asked Cravath if they could borrow Bayo to help negotiate and finance a $6 billion liquefied\nnatural gas plant in Nigeria. Bayo never returned to Cravath, but instead quickly rose through the ranks of Credit Suisse, eventually\nheading the firm's global banking division and being elected to the firm's board of directors. In 2006, Bayo left Credit Suisse to\nbecome a cofounder of a private equity firm, Global Infrastructure Partners, which makes infrastructure investments, especially in\n\nthe energy, transportation, and water industries. Who says that America is not a land of opportunity.\n\nDuring the taxi ride to Goldman\u2019s headquarters, I thought about the upcoming meeting and predicted that Bayo would emphasize\nthat Goldman\u2019s board is quite independent from management, that the board focuses on controlling risks, and that the board\nwould keep a lid on management\u2019s compensation. These were three obvious key issues. Sure enough, Bayo focused on the three\nissues, giving sales pitches that were designed to comfort a shareholder. Thus, I did not learn much from the meeting, but I had not\n\nexpected to.\n\nAnother consideration weighed on my mind. Bayo was affable, articulate, and seemingly knowledgeable about Goldman Sachs\u2019s\noperations. But how much could he really know? He had a full-time job elsewhere. His knowledge of Goldman probably mainly\ncame from what management told him and from information in materials prepared for board meetings. Directors are outsiders.\n\nThey normally cannot unobtrusively wander around the offices and trading desks of Goldman to find out what really is going on.\n\f"}, "003737.png": {"text": "I will never forget a board meeting of the lead smelting company that I was a director of in the 1970s. The meeting was held at a\nsecondary smelter. At secondary smelters, old car batteries are crushed and processed to separate the lead from other materials.\nThe lead is then purified in a furnace and resold. Secondary smelters tend to be dirty\u2014in fact, filthy. When a battery is being\ncrushed, it is difficult to contain all the lead and other materials in a controlled space. Yet the smelter where the board meeting was\nheld was spotless. I imagined that the workers at the smelter spent hours with brushes, vacuum cleaners, mops, towels, chemicals,\nand even toothbrushes cleansing the smelter in advance of the arrival of the directors. My suspicions were corroborated when I\ntook a bathroom break during the meeting. In the men\u2019s room, after drying my hands, I noticed that the towel disposal container\nwas filled with about 50 empty cans of Pledge. Similarly, I believe that the information that directors receive about a company\n\nusually is carefully scrubbed by management, who continually wish to look as good as possible.\n\nIn mid-December, I received an e-mail from Bayo announcing the election of two new directors to Goldman\u2019s board. The e-mail\nincluded resumes. I was impressed, not only by the quality of the new directors, but especially by the effort Bayo made to e-mail\nme (and likely other larger shareholders as well) about the election. The e-mail reminded me of a comment made more than 40\nyears earlier by Bob Menschel, a friend, who by coincidence was a top executive at Goldman Sachs at the time. Bob\u2019s comment\nwas that small caring efforts toward employees pay off in favorable relationships and favorable morale. Remember birthdays.\nAsk about children or vacation plans. Occasionally, take an employee out to lunch. Buy employees small Christmas presents. Bayo\nwas following Bob\u2019s advice, and it paid off. Somebody at Goldman (Bayo or a person on his staff) made the effort to care about\n\nGreenhaven and me, and my positive feelings toward Goldman increased by yet another notch.\n\nIn May 2015, I received another invitation to Goldman\u2019s headquarters, this time to meet with Gary Cohn and CFO Harvey\nSchwartz. Again, I leapt at the opportunity. The previous month, Goldman had reported that it had earned a surprisingly strong\n$5.94 per share in the first quarter of 2015, which was equal to a 15 percent return on tangible equity. The $5.94 is, of course,\n\nequivalent to an annualized earnings rate of nearly $24 per share. Remember, I had been projecting that Goldman might earn\n\f"}, "003738.png": {"text": "about $22 per share in 2016. Therefore, at least in the first quarter of 2015, Goldman\u2019s earnings already were exceeding my\n\nprojections.\n\nAt the meeting at Goldman\u2019s headquarters, I peppered Gary and Harvey with questions about the sustainability of first-quarter\nearnings. What business lines were operating above trend line? How much were they above trend line, and why? What business\nlines were operating below trend line? How much were they below trend line, and why? Management was reluctant to disclose\nmuch of the information I sought, but I did leave the meeting with the belief that the company\u2019s normal earnings power should be\nsomewhere close to 15 percent of its tangible book value and that management was conservative and was bent on underpromising\nand overdelivering. When meeting with managements, I often hear a company\u2019s \u201cparty line\u2019\u2014a line that dwells on the company\u2019s\ngreatness and future prosperity and that ignores the company\u2019s weaknesses. In the case of Goldman, my gut feel was that Gary and\n\nHarvey were straight shooters and that their opinions largely could be trusted.\n\nOn June 2, during a presentation at Deutsche Bank, Gary Cohn said the following about the normality of the first-quarter earnings:\n\u201cWe saw an environment where our clients were a little bit more active. We do not think that this is the upside per se. We feel like\n\nwe have got plenty of upside potential in our business model.\u201d Of course, these words were music to my ears.\n\nThe music then continued as Gary listed reasons why Goldman should prosper in the future:\n\nWe are, in many ways, a technology firm, with about one quarter of our employees in our technology division. We have made a\n\nnumber of key technology investments that provide us with a unique competitive advantage.\n\nWe have transformed our financial profile. We have restructured our expense space. We have created robust tools and processes\nto inform our capital allocation decisions. We have a strong position within each of our businesses and have sold or shut down\nbusinesses that are likely to be dilutive to returns going forward. We are in an improving competitive position. And, we are well\n\npositioned to capture the opportunities as the environment improves.\n\f"}, "003739.png": {"text": "Over the summer, I asked several competitors whether Gary\u2019s words were credible or were \u201cBS.\u201d The competitors responded that\n\nGary was a salesman but that his optimism was well founded and that Goldman was a powerhouse.\n\nThe more I learned about Goldman Sachs, the more I was convinced that we had made an exciting investment. But I still monitored\nthe company closely, particularly on guard for any external development that might derail our analysis and conclusions.\nOccasionally, a black swan adverse event does derail one or more of our investments. When this happens, we must be ready to\n\nunemotionally rethink the economics of continuing to hold the investments\u2014and, if necessary, sell.\n\nThis happened in the fall of 2014. At the time, we owned large positions in three oil and gas service companies and a smaller\nposition in a producer of oil and gas. During the summer of 2014, the price of crude oil still was being supported at a high level\n\nby the OPEC cartel, and particularly by Saudi Arabia. It was clear to us at the time that increased production of oil from North\nAmerican shale fields and from Iraq was creating excess capacity in the world, but we believed that it was in Saudi Arabia\u2019s interest\nto reduce its production in order to eliminate the excess capacity and thus to maintain prices at a high level. But we were wrong.\nEvidently, the leaders of Saudi Arabia concluded that, instead of continually reducing their production to offset the increasing\nproduction elsewhere, it was advantageous to \u201cnip it in the bud\u201d and let prices fall to a level where drilling new higher-cost North\n\nAmerican oil wells would become uneconomic and, as a consequence, North American oil production would stall or fall.\n\nThe price of crude oil, which was roughly $100 per barrel during the summer of 2014, started to decline in September. The decline\ncontinued in October, and by early November the price broke below $80. I then analyzed detailed estimates and projections of the\nsupply and demand by geographic region and came to the conclusion that, unless production was curtailed by political or military\nunrest in unstable countries or unless production was curtailed by Saudi Arabia, the surplus of crude oil would continue to grow.\nIasked myself: if Saudi Arabia intended to maintain high price levels by curtailing production, why did the Saudis let the price\n\nof crude fall as low as $80? Most \u201cexperts\u201d and the media were predicting that the OPEC cartel would hold and that prices would\n\nrecover, but there is an old expression that one should not pay attention to the noise in the market, but rather to the price of the\n\f"}, "003740.png": {"text": "fish. And the price of the fish was telling me that the cartel might not be holding. My obvious concern was that the earnings and\nvalues of our oil-related holdings would deteriorate in a lower-oil-price environment. Oil and gas companies would have less funds\nand less incentive to drill new wells, and the value of oil reserves in the ground would decline. I then tried to estimate what the\nnormal price for oil would be if the cartel did not hold. My conclusion was that the normal price would be somewhere in the range\nof $55 to $70 per barrel. If long-term prices were above $70, a sufficient number of shale oil and other higher cost wells would be\neconomic that there would be excess production. But if longer-term prices were below $55, an insufficient number of wells would\nbe economic to satisfy world demand. I then concluded that if the longer-term prices of crude were in the range of $55 to $70, our\nfour oil-related holdings no longer would be sufficiently attractive. Because I lacked confidence that Saudi Arabia would reduce\n\nits production, on November 13, I started selling the holdings. On November 27, at a meeting in Vienna, OPEC officially declared\nthat it was abandoning its policy of controlling production and prices. By early 2015, we no longer owned any oil- and gas-related\n\ninvestments.\n\nIn very late 2014, I had a long conversation with a portfolio manager who continued to be heavily invested in oil-producing\ncompanies. He told me that my supply-demand numbers were wrong because they underestimated future demand from\nemerging countries, especially China. He e-mailed me two projections by Wall Street security analysts that showed a tightening\noil market in 2015. I had read many reports by Wall Street analysts and industry consultants. Almost all seemed to agree that\nthere would be a surplus of supply in 2015 unless the Saudis curtailed production. It seemed to me that the portfolio manager\nhad purposefully sought out two minority opinions that happened to agree with his original analysis\u2014and had ignored the vast\nmajority of opinions. He had closed his mind to a probable new development. He was engaged in wishful thinking. I believe that\nit is important for investors to avoid seeking out information that reinforces their original analyses. Instead, investors must\n\nbe prepared and willing to change their analyses and minds when presented with new developments that adversely alter the\n\nfundamentals of an industry or company. Good investors should have open minds and be flexible.\n\f"}, "003741.png": {"text": "In mid-2015, I had breakfast with the same portfolio manager who was retaining his holdings in oil-producing companies. He had\ngiven up on his theory that the oil market would tighten soon, but he now had a new theory. He believed that the five very large\nintegrated international oil companies4 likely would be interested in acquiring U.S. oil producers because of the political stability\nof the United States and because of the opportunity to use horizontal drilling and multistage fracking to economically increase\nreserves and production in shale formations. He believed that one or more of his oil holdings would be acquired at a premium\nprice by one of the five giant companies. After the breakfast, I went to my Bloomberg terminal and discovered that there were\n\n28 medium-sized U.S. oil and gas producers that had a market value of $5 billion or more. One never knows where lightning will\nstrike, so one never knows which of the 28 companies would be acquired by the 5 very large integrated companies, if any. Since\n\nI would not know which company might be acquired, I could even my bets by purchasing an equal-sized position in each of the\n28 companies. If each of the 5 large integrated companies indeed purchased one of the 28 during the next 12 months, and if the\nacquisition price was at a 30 percent premium to the market price, then the basket of my 28 holdings would appreciate by about 5\npercent, other things being equal. Greenhaven tries to achieve annual returns of 15 to 20 percent, so the prospect of acquisitions\nadding 5 percent to a portion of our portfolio is not very exciting. And the 5 percent assumes that each of the 5 large companies\n\nis in the mood to make an acquisition during the next 12 months, which strikes me as a low-probability occurrence. Simply, the\neconomics of the portfolio manager\u2019s new theory did not seem to justify an investment in the 28 companies. It seems to me that\nhe was groping for a reason to continue holding his oil-producing companies. We have a straightforward approach. When we\n\nare wrong or when fundamentals turn against us, we readily admit we are wrong and we reverse our course. We do not seek new\n\ntheories that will justify our original decision. We do not let errors fester and consume our attention. We sell and move on.\n\nIn late October 2015, a client, Mike Overlock, called to schedule a lunch date.

In addition, in 1990, he was appointed to Goldman\u2019s Management Committee, which is the committee that\n\nlargely managed the firm when it was a partnership.

If Goldman did not earn a return of about 10 percent on its trading\nbusiness, many of its competitors would not earn sufficient returns on some of their trading lines to warrant continuing\nthe lines. As competitors exited their lower return lines, competition would decline, spreads would widen, and Goldman\u2019s\nreturns would gravitate toward 10 percent. With respect to investing, Goldman mainly owns equities and loans. Over time,\ninvestors in common stocks have earned an average annual return of 9 to 10 percent. And over time, banks have earned more\nthan 10 percent average annual return on their loan portfolios, assuming that the portfolios are normally leveraged with\ndeposits and borrowings. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Goldman\u2019s investing operations should see at least a 10\n\npercent return on invested capital.\n\f"}, "003743.png": {"text": "4 The five are BP, Chevron, Exxon, Royal Dutch, and Total.\n\f"}, "003744.png": {"text": "14\n\nA LETTER TO JACK ELGART\n\nIn 2008, a younger investment manager asked me to explain our approach to investing and to give him any additional advice that might\n\nbe useful. In response to his request, I wrote the following letter.\n\neco\nDear Jack,\n\nThank you for your questions, which I will try to answer in this letter. I apologize for the length of the letter. It is difficult to do\njustice to a complex subject in a few paragraphs. Also, please be mindful that there is nothing sacred about the way I invest or\n\nabout my ideas. As in so many things in life, there are many differing approaches to being a successful investor.\n\nThere is a saying that going to church does not make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car. And it\nalso is true that having specific strategies and approaches to investing does not make you a Warren Buffett. But it helps, and it has\n\nhelped me to make reasoned investment decisions, especially during difficult times.\n\nOur central strategy is to purchase deeply undervalued securities of strong and growing companies that likely will appreciate\nsharply as the result of positive developments. Our reasoning is that the undervaluation, growth, and strength should provide\nprotection against permanent loss, while the undervaluation, growth, strength, and positive developments should present the\n\nopportunity to earn high returns.\n\f"}, "003745.png": {"text": "Iemphasize that our first goal is to control the risks of permanent loss. When we analyze a security, we first look for the attributes\nthat will protect us against incurring a loss that cannot be recovered within a reasonable period of time. We will not commence\nanalyzing the positive attributes of a security until we are convinced that the risks of permanent loss in the security are relatively\n\nlow.\n\nOur emphasis on controlling risks leads us to be value investors as opposed to growth-stock investors. We have observed that, over\nthe years, many growth stocks have permanently lost value due to a slow-down in their growth rates, often caused by maturing\n\nmarkets or by increased competition (including competition from new destructive technologies\u2014Kodak being just one example).\n\nOver the past 50+ years, the stock market has provided annual average returns of 9 to 10 percent (appreciation plus dividends).\n\nIf an investor purchases a portfolio of undervalued stocks and if the stocks merely perform in line with the market, the investor\u2019s\nlonger-term returns should average 9 to 10 percent. However, if the investor can find undervalued securities and can creatively\nproject the occurrence of positive developments that already have not been discounted into the price of the securities, he can\nhope to earn outsized returns. Examples of positive developments include a cyclical upturn in the earnings of a company or\nindustry, the solving of a problem that has been a drain of earnings, the introduction of an exciting new product or service, or the\nreplacement of a weak management with a strong one. It sometimes takes a long time for a particular security to benefit from a\npositive development and to appreciate sharply. One has to be patient. But what happens if a predicted positive development fails\nto occur at all, which does happen? Then, the average stock still should provide average returns of 9 to 10 percent over time. This is\n\nnot an unfavorable outcome. We are deprived of the icing, but we still get the cake.\n\nThus, in my opinion, an analytical, creative, and disciplined investor who uses sage judgment can achieve returns materially in\nexcess of the market average. If such an investor succeeds in achieving average returns materially in excess of 9 to 10 percent, he\neventually can become very wealthy through the power of compounding. Compounding is one of my favorite words. Compounding\n\nis powerful. Warren Buffett did not become one of the wealthiest men in the world by suddenly striking gold in a single highly\n\f"}, "003746.png": {"text": "successful investment, but rather by compounding the value of Berkshire Hathaway at a 20 percent or so rate for 45 years. If an\ninvestor can achieve an average annual return of 20 percent, then, after 45 years, an initial investment of $1 million will appreciate\n\nto $3.6 billion.1 Wow!\n\nHowever, while value investing sounds easy, one should remember that there are thousands of other investors trying to\nsuccessfully do what you are trying to do, so value investing is a competitive (but fun and exciting) battle. To be a successful\nvalue investor, it helps to have a highly creative mind that is able to develop theses about the future, particularly about likely\npositive developments. I have given considerable thought to how an individual can increase his creativity, but the human mind\n\nis amorphous, and understanding the creative workings of the mind is like trying to get one\u2019s hands around a cloud. However, I\nwould say that it is helpful to let your mind wander, to be open to new ideas and change, and to free your mind from preconceived\n\nnotions. Creative ideas rarely come in a flash, but rather usually from a combination or a reinterpretation of existing ideas.\n\nValue investors also need experience. After graduating from a business school and after a few years working as an investment\nprofessional, an intelligent and diligent investor likely will become proficient at playing the notes, but it still can require several\nadditional years before he can play the music. As in music and sports, the best professionals tend to develop a rhythm and feel\nthat comes with long practice and that leads to optimum results. In my opinion, the intuitive feel (or sixth sense) that most good\n\ninvestors develop partially comes from an innate ability and partially from experience.\n\nIn addition to creativity and experience, a good value investor needs the self-confidence to be able to make decisions that are\ncounter to the combined conventional wisdom of other investors. The price of a stock at any one moment reflects the conventional\nwisdom of the market. Conceptually, a stock that appears out of favor and materially undervalued to you does not appear\nundervalued to most other investors. Otherwise, a sufficient number of other investors already would have decided to purchase\nthe stock, driving its price to its intrinsic value. Therefore, a good value investor must make decisions based on his own analysis\n\nand judgment and must ignore the mass of opinions from Wall Street analysts, newspaper journalists, TV commentators, and\n\f"}, "003747.png": {"text": "others. He must be a contrarian, and he must be willing and able to feel lonely and uncomfortable. When purchasing a stock, it is\n\nusually better to feel uncomfortable than comfortable.\n\nAlso, decisions seldom are clear. There always are uncertainties about the fundamentals of a company, and every company has\npresent or potential problems as well as present or future strengths. However, an investor can try to assess the probabilities of\n\ncertain outcomes occurring and then make his decisions based on the probabilities. Investing is probabilistic.\n\nTo successfully assess probabilities and make good investment decisions, an investor should hold considerable amounts of\ninformation about the companies and industries he is investing in. Having superior information (both quantity and quality) can\ngive an investor a competitive edge. To obtain information, we spend a large percentage of our time researching the fundamentals\n\nof companies.\n\nWhile investing is not formularistic, there do seem to be a number of reoccurring patterns and strategies that one should take\n\nadvantage of or should guard against:\n\n1. Be careful not to let your mind acclimate to a present circumstance, and then lose perspective. This is particularly true after a\nlong period of prosperity. During \u201cbull\u201d markets, many investors tend to give themselves too much credit for favorable results\nand to give insufficient credit to the positive environment that played a large role in creating the results. This can lead to\n\noverconfidence on the part of the investor and resulting misassessments of risks.\n\n2. Beware of projecting past or present trends into the future. The past often is an unreliable guide to the future. Steering an\nautomobile by looking in the rearview mirror works as long as the road is straight, but is disaster when the road reaches a sharp\n\ncurve. The same is true in investing.\n\f"}, "003748.png": {"text": "3. Beware of seeking out information that reinforces your existing points of view or of screening out information that threatens\nto expose flaws in your existing beliefs. When you own a security, you are prone to be more accepting of good news about the\n\nsecurity than bad news, and this can create a bias that leads to faulty decision making.\n\n-\n\n. Intensively research stocks and industries, and pay attention to the quality of the information as well as the quantity. Quality\ninformation reduces uncertainty and risk. However, while it is dangerous to make decisions based on only a small amount of\ninformation, one should not miss investment opportunities due to overresearching an idea. You do not have to drink a whole\n\nbowl of soup to know how it tastes.\n\nw\n\n. Be wary about basing investment decisions on predictions about the economy, interest rates, or stock market. There are so many\nvariables that affect the direction of the economy, interest rates, or stock market that it is nearly impossible to identify, analyze,\nand weigh all the relevant variables, and even if this could be done, an investor would have difficulty estimating how much of\nthe future already has been discounted into the price of individual securities. Experience has shown that investors are prone to\noverestimate how much they understand about the world, and underestimate the role of chance in events. Woody Allen once\n\nsaid: \u201cI am astounded by people who want to know the universe when it is hard enough to know your way around Chinatown.\u201d\n\na\n\nManagements of companies possess more information about their companies than you ever will be able to possess. Pay more\nattention to what managements do than to what they say. Remember, managements, like most other people, tend to act in their\nself-interest. It often is a favorable sign when managements purchase shares of their companies for their own accounts, and\n\nvice versa. Favor managements who are highly incentivized to achieve higher prices for their shares.\n\n7. Be particularly wary of projections made by managements and others who have vested interests in having their projections\n\nbelieved and acted upon.\n\f"}, "003749.png": {"text": "8. Be wary of companies that largely have been \u201cput together\u201d through recent acquisitions. Normally, acquisitions are made\nthrough an auction process, with the acquiring company agreeing to pay the highest price. I agree with Warren Buffett that the\nsmartest side to take in a bidding war is the losing side. After purchasing a painting at auction at Christie\u2019s or Sotheby\u2019s, I often\nam congratulated by my neighbors in the audience. My reaction is: why should anybody be congratulated for paying a price that\nno one else was willing to pay? When I value a company that has been acquisitive, I estimate that the parts of the businesses\nthat recently were acquired are worth the price they were acquired at, plus some premium for subsequent growth or synergies,\nless a discount if I believe that the acquiring company overpaid. Thus, companies that largely have been put together in recent\n\nyears normally are not worth a large premium to their stated book values.\n\n9. Be aware of the laws of supply and demand. The balance between supply and demand normally is the main determinant of\nthe market price of the item. Also, be aware that countervailing forces usually affect supply and demand. For example, when\nan item is selling at a high price because of a tight supply, the market tightness often is mitigated or erased by new supplies\n\n(attracted by the high prices), reduced demand (motivated by the high prices), or substitution into less expensive items.\n\n10. Be wary of stock recommendations made by others, especially by those in the media who may sound articulate and\nauthoritative, but who lack the resources to be successful professional investors. A horse that can count to 10 is a wonderful\n\nhorse, but not a wonderful mathematician.\n\n11. Do not be overly influenced by the media. Because bad news sells, the media has a pessimistic bias. Over many years, a large\npercentage of the severe problems predicted by the media never materialized, or proved to be far less severe than predicted.\nThe cover story of the August 13, 1979, issue of BusinessWeek was titled \u201cThe Death of Equities.\u201d The article\u2019s gist was that\ninvestors were switching out of common stocks in favor of higher-yielding investments\u2014and that it was likely that the stock\nmarket would not recover soon from the doldrums it had been in for many years. At the time the article was written, the S&P\n\n500 Index was no higher than it had been 11 years earlier. Well, BusinessWeek was dead wrong.

Avoid over-relying on numbers and models. Investors often feel comfortable with numbers and models because they appear\ndefinitive. However, they can be misleading because they often are based on historical data that may not be repeatable or\nare based on assumptions that may not prove valid. We need numbers and models, but their utility should be paired with\njudgment and common sense. There is the story of a statistician who drowned crossing a river that was only three feet deep on\n\naverage. He obviously lacked both judgment and common sense.\n\n13. Separate your analysis from your emotions. Especially during a difficult period, many investors become distraught, let\ntheir emotions dictate their investment decisions, and make decisions that are irrational and costly. By understanding your\nemotions and by understanding the nature of a difficult period, an investor can hope to organize and control his mind to think\n\nand act rationally.\n\n14. Seek simplicity. An investor cannot be sure how an investment is going to turn out, but he can attempt to identify and analyze\nthe key possibilities, then assess the odds of each possibility taking place, and finally make a reasoned decision based on the\nodds and estimated economics of the key possibilities. We live in a world of possibilities and probabilities, not certainties.

Anumber of years ago, I adopted a methodology that is useful in determining whether the stock market is overvalued. I started\nby analyzing the \u201cearnings\u201d of the S&P 500 Index for the 40-year period 1960 to 2000. My conclusions (reached with the help\nof regression analysis) were that the earnings have grown at about a 6.8 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and\nthat the trend-line (i.e., normal) earnings on the S&P 500 in 2000 should have been about 46.75. I then calculated that, during\nthe same 40-year period, the S&P 500 Index \u201csold\u201d at an average price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 15.8 times, which, I reasoned,\nis the normal PE ratio for the stock market. Thus, based on these historical metrics, I concluded that the normal level of the\nS&P 500 Index in 2000 should have been about 739 (46.75 x 15.8). Since earnings have grown at a 6.8 percent CAGR and since\nI know of no reason why this level of growth should not continue, I can then project future normal values for the S&P 500. In\n2010, for example, the normal value of the S&P 500 should be about 1,427 (739 incremented at a 6.8 percent rate for 10 years).\nThus, in 2010, if the S&P 500 happens to sell at 1,725, I would conclude that, based on historic metrics, the stock market is\novervalued by roughly 21 percent. Because we wish to buy low and sell high, knowledge of where the market is selling relative\n\nto its historical metrics often is helpful, especially when the market is selling at an inflated level.\n\n1\n\nq\n\n. Conceptually, any investor can attempt to increase his2 returns by accepting additional risks. Treasury bills are considered risk\nfree but pay low interest rates. Investment-grade corporate bonds are riskier but pay higher interest rates than Treasury bills.\n\u201cJunk bonds\u201d generally are quite risky but normally pay quite high interest rates. Similarly, some common stocks are riskier\nthan others. Every investor must analyze risks of permanent loss and must decide how much risk he is willing to assume.\nThere is no correct answer to the proper level of risk avoidance. It depends on the nature of the investment and on the needs,\n\ndesires, and personality of the investor.\n\n18. While an investor should work hard to avoid permanent loss, he must guard against being so risk averse that he turns down\ntoo many promising opportunities for fear of making a mistake. Even the best investors occasionally will err. To err is human\u2014\n\nand we should not let errors dull our confidence or spirits.\n\f"}, "003752.png": {"text": "19. Be prepared and willing to change your mind if your initial decision was flawed or if circumstances change. Be readily willing\n\nto admit that you made a mistake.\n\n20. Invest for the longer term (two years at a minimum) and deemphasize the significance of short-term results. Most hedge\nfunds and mutual funds and many other investors are under pressure to achieve short-term performance. Thus, there is fierce\ncompetition for ideas that will appreciate sharply over the next quarter or so. There is much less competition for stocks that\nhave less certain shorter-term prospects, even if they appear to have excellent intermediate-term prospects\u2014and that is where\n\nwe normally want to be.\n\n2\n\n. Do not attempt to \u201ctime\u201d the stock market. The near-term direction of the stock market is determined by so many forces that\nit is difficult for anybody to identify all the relevant ones, let alone understand and weigh them and then determine the extent\nthat they already are discounted into the market. Furthermore, the forces are dynamic, leaving market timers at the mercy of\nfuture developments that are difficult (and many times impossible) to predict. For all these reasons, most market timers do\nnot seem to enjoy acceptable batting averages. We agree with Warren Buffett, who, at the 1994 Annual Meeting of Berkshire\nHathaway, said: \u201cI never have an opinion on the market because it would not be any good and it might interfere with opinions\n\nthat are good.\u201d\n\n22. Try to remain relatively fully invested as long as you can find a sufficient number of attractive securities. Because corporate\nearnings and the stock markets appreciate over time, if you are fully invested, you are swimming with the tide. However, when\nyou cannot find a sufficient number of attractive securities to remain fully invested, be willing to hold cash. Do not stretch to\nremain fully invested. Further, if you perceive that there are excesses or other unacceptable risks in the economy, be willing to\ntighten your investment standards and sell stocks that had acceptable risk profiles in a lower-risk economy but unacceptable\n\nrisk profiles in a higher-risk economy.\n\f"}, "003753.png": {"text": "23. Try to generally think and act positively and optimistically. Because over the longer run the stock market appreciates at a mid-\n\nsingle-digit annual rate, it normally is advantageous to have an optimistic view of the world rather than a pessimistic one.\n\n24. Structure a concentrated portfolio, yet a diverse portfolio. Conceptually, the first stock one selects for a portfolio has the most\nfavorable risk-to-reward ratio, and each succeeding selected stock has a somewhat less favorable risk-to-reward ratio. Thus,\naconcentrated portfolio of 15 to 25 stocks should provide materially better risk-adjusted returns than a portfolio of 30 to\n50 stocks. Yet one should seek sufficient diversity that a few permanent losses do not permanently impair the value of the\nportfolio or the confidence of the portfolio manager. It is important for a portfolio manager to sleep well at night. To achieve\nboth concentration and diversity, a portfolio might consist of 15 to 25 holdings, with no individual security accounting\nfor more than 12 percent of the value of the portfolio and no one industry accounting for more than 25 percent. The limits\nshould be based on costs, not on market value, so that the portfolio manager is not forced to sell shares in a holding that has\n\nappreciated sharply, but that still remains attractive.\n25. Be relaxed and invest with a passion.\n\nInvesting is exciting and intellectually challenging. It is fun. It also can be highly profitable, especially for someone like you who\nis bright and highly motivated. I hope that if you are a successful investor and if you become wealthy, you will use your wealth\nwisely. I believe that Pericles (who was an Athenian general and leader in the fifth century before Christ) had it right when he\nstated in his Funeral Oration: \u201cWealth to us is not mere material for vainglory, but rather an opportunity for achievement.\u201d And\nWarren Buffett and Bill Gates have it right when they donate a large percentage of their wealth to charity\u2014to help others who are\n\nfar less fortunate in life than they.\nThope this letter is useful. Again, there are many approaches to investing successfully\u2014many ways to skin a cat.\n\nBest of luck with your investment career,\n\f"}, "003789.png": {"text": "\f"}}
