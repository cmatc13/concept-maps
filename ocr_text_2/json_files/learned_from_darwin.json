Investing, unlike the name suggests, is all too often a euphemism for gambling in which the\n\npractitioners rarely do better than dart-throwing primates.\n\nSuperficially, there are many other differences between the two fields. Evolutionary biology is practiced by serious pro-\nfessionals, and the investment field is dominated by amateurs who take themselves too seriously. Knowledge and the quest for\ntruth motivate evolutionary biologists; for most investors, knowledge and truth be damned so long as their 2/20: is protected.\n\nEvolutionary biologists perform a tremendous amount of research in narrow fields (e.g., \u201cSecondary Contact and Genomic Ad-\n\f"}, "001759.png": {"text": "mixture Between Rhesus and Long-Tailed Macaques in the Indochina Peninsula\u201d2). Investors, on the other hand, make confident\npronouncements (e.g., \u201cI think the markets will rise 10 percent this year\u201d) based on spurious spreadsheets, flawed assumptions,\nand inflated egos.\n\nThe biggest difference, though, is that the two are moving in opposite directions. Evolutionary biologists continue to be-\ncome better at their craft, whereas investors continue to get worse.\n\nIn recent years, biologists have used Darwin's evolutionary theory to explain things like the origin of the human hepatitis\nvirus, the consequences of sexual selection acting on female animals, the effect of microbiomes on the evolution of animals, the\nlink between cultural inheritance among the great apes and Darwinian evolution, and the effect of gene flow on evolution of\nspecies.2 If you explore the \u201cevolution\u201d section of any scientific journal (for example, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sci-\nences, available at www.pnas.org), you will be dazzled by the range of research topics and the stunning advances being made by\nscientists.\n\nBut the investment community? It doesn\u2019t matter how you look at it\u2014the data are ugly. Really ugly. And it shows that we,\nthe fund managers, are idiots.\n\nAccording to a 2021 S&P report on the U.S. equity market (called the SPIVA U.S. Scorecard), across periods of five, ten, and\ntwenty years, 75 to 90 percent of U.S. domestic funds underperformed the market. Let that fact sink in before you read any fur-\nther. About 75 to 90 percent of fund managers, most of whom have graduate degrees, including MBAs, from elite schools and man-\nage trillions of dollars, fail to beat the market. If you are part of the financial services community, you may believe that it is easier\nto outperform the small-cap market benchmarks. Not true. The market outperformed about 93 percent of small-cap funds during\nthe ten-year period from 2011 to 2021.\n\nThat is bad enough, but the dismal news does not end there. Not only are most U.S. funds underperforming, but they have\nalso gotten worse over time. According to the same S&P report, in 2009,5 over three- and five-year periods (ten- and twenty-year pe-\n\nriods were not reported), \u201conly\u201d 55 to 60 percent of U.S. domestic funds had underperformed the market.\n\f"}, "001760.png": {"text": "This phenomenon is not unique to the United States. In the Indian equity market, as of 2017, 43 to 53 percent of large-cap\nfunds had underperformed benchmarks over three- and five-year periods. However, as of 2020,2 those numbers had become\nmuch worse: About 70 to 80 percent of large-cap funds had been unable to beat their benchmarks over periods of three, five, and\nten years.\n\nNo wonder passively managed funds have been growing at a much faster pace than active mutual funds. According toa\n2020 Deloitte report,\u2019 since 2009, U.S. passive funds, valued at $6.6 trillion in 2018, had grown by more than four times, whereas\nU.S. active funds, valued at $11.4 trillion, had grown by less than 1.7 times. The reason? The performance of U.S. passive funds\nhandsomely beat that of U.S. active funds during that period.\n\nI know you may now be asking the following questions: How in the world can an obscure field like evolutionary biology be\na solution to this problem? What is it that investors\u2019 overpriced and overvalued MBA educations did not teach them that a study\nof Darwinian evolution could? What can the folks who worship abstractions like cash flow, price/earnings (PE) ratios, and capital\nasset pricing models learn from the people who spend decades digging up fossil specimens, argue whether Neanderthals had sex\nwith humans, and accord a godlike status to a nineteenth-century Englishman who studied earthworms, pigeons, and barnacles?\n\nA lot, I will argue.\n\nBut before we get there, who am I, and why did I write this book?\n\nWho Am I?\n\nIam an equity fund manager. In 2007, I founded an investment firm called Nalanda Capital, which currently manages a little more\nthan US$5 billion invested in listed Indian securities. Nalanda\u2019s investment philosophy can be summarized in ten words: We want\n\nto be permanent owners of high-quality businesses.\n\f"}, "001761.png": {"text": "Let me repeat that: We want to be permanent owners. We don\u2019t invest unless we think we can own a business forever. A bad\nbusiness that is dirt cheap? Pass. A mediocre business at a low price? Thanks, but no thanks. A high-quality business at a fair price?\n\nGive me more so I can never let go.\n\nWe invest almost exclusively in businesses owned and run by entrepreneurs of which the entrepreneur is typically the\n\nlargest shareholder, and we are usually the second largest.\n\nNalanda\u2019s approach to investing comprises three straightforward, sequential steps:\n\n1. Avoid big risks.\n2. Buy high quality at a fair price.\n\n3. Don\u2019t be lazy\u2014be very lazy.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThis straightforward investment process has led to the following outcome. One rupee (INR 1) invested in Nalanda\u2019s first\nfund at its inception in June 2007 would have been worth INR 13.8 in September 2022. The same amount invested in India\u2019s Sen-\nsex (the country\u2019s large-cap index) would have been worth INR 3.9, and if invested in the Midcap Index would have been worth\nonly INR 4. Over a little more than fifteen years, based on actual cash inflows and outflows, the annualized rupee return for this\nfund was 20.3 percent (after all our fees), and the fund beat both the Sensex and the Midcap Index by 10.9 percentage points. That\n\nis not a bad track record.\n\nBefore founding Nalanda, I worked for almost nine years at the global private equity firm Warburg Pincus.

Buy High Quality at a Fair Price\nSection III. Don\u2019t Be Lazy\u2014Be Very Lazy\n\nSection I highlights the most basic investing lesson of all: Avoid big risks. Don\u2019t lose money. Like most deceptively simple\nthings in life, this is easier said than done. Yes, not losing money is a skill, maybe a skill harder to learn than making money. As\n\nWarren Buffett has famously said, \u201cRule number 1: Never lose money. Rule number 2: Don\u2019t forget rule number 1.\u201d\n\nHave you noticed that almost every book on investing provides strategies and tactics that encourage you to do things a\ncertain way? Some advise you to trade based on market signals, some recommend buying value stocks, and some urge you to bet\non Al and biotech start-ups. These books are about making money. You do not see books telling you how not to Jose money. The sad\nreality is that unless an investor learns to avoid losses, their investment career is likely to be short and brutal.\n\nSection II sums up Nalanda\u2019s second mantra: Buy high quality at a fair price. It focuses on the nuts and bolts of Nalanda\u2019s\nbuying process as seen from the perspective of Darwinian evolutionary theory. Chapters 2 to 4 deal with what to buy, and chapters\n5 to 7 explore how to buy.\n\nSection III covers the third area of Nalanda\u2019s investment approach: Don\u2019t be lazy\u2014be very lazy.

For me, buying a hot\nfudge sundae at McDonald\u2019s falls into the first category, and not keeping in regular touch with my school and college friends falls\n\ninto the second.\n\nAll investors, too, make these two mistakes. Let me borrow from the field of statistics to describe them. The first kind\u2014\ndubbed a type I error! by statisticians who can never be blamed for being creative\u2014occurs when I make a bad investment because I\nerroneously think it is a good one. It is the error of committing self-harm and is also called a false positive or error of commission.\nAtype II error occurs when I reject a good investment because I erroneously think it is bad. This is the error of rejecting a potential\nbenefit and can be termed a false negative or error of omission. Every investor, including Warren Buffett, makes these two errors\n\nona regular basis. They either harm themselves or walk away from a great opportunity.\n\nAs any statistician will tell you, the risk of these two errors is inversely related.2 Minimizing the risk of a type I error typically\nincreases the risk of a type II error, and minimizing the risk of a type II error increases the risk of a type I error. Intuitively, this\nseems logical. Imagine an overly optimistic investor who sees an upside in almost every investment. This individual will make sev-\neral type I errors by committing to bad investments but also will not miss out on the few good investments. On the other hand, an\noverly cautious investor who keeps finding reasons to reject every investment is likely to make very few bad investments but will\n\nlose out on some good investments.\n\f"}, "001772.png": {"text": "Investors can\u2019t have their cake and eat it, too! They need to choose to be more sensitive to making one type of error while\n\nliving with the consequences of making more errors of the other kind. What should one do? What should you do?\n\nIn other words, which of the following investment strategies should you use: (1) making a lot of investments so as not to lose\nout on some good opportunities and, as a result, living with some failed investments, or (2) being highly selective to avoid making\nbad investments, thereby missing out on some good investments?\n\nLet\u2019s turn to evolution to seek the answer.\n\nThe goal of all animals is to survive for as long as possible, at least until they reproduce. In the animal world, everyone is\n\nboth prey and predator. Yes, even we, the Homo sapiens. How are we prey? Remember COVID-19?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the prey. What would be a typeI error for a prey animal? It would equate to inflicting sufficient harm on\n\nitself to compromise its fitness. Let me illustrate the case of an adult male deer to explore two kinds of type I errors.\n\nThe first kind occurs when the deer is thirsty and is near a watering hole. Borne by instinct or experience or both, the deer\nknows that the watering hole could sound its death knell if a lion or leopard or crocodile is hiding, waiting for the opportunity of\nan easy meal. If the deer chooses to approach the watering hole, it slakes its thirst quickly and then moves away. And if it mistak-\n\nenly draws near while a predator is ready and waiting, its life ends.\n\nFrom the fossil record, we know that the deer that we see today evolved from ungulates about fifteen to thirty million years\nago.2 They have survived millions of years amid ferocious predators by being very sensitive to making type I errors\u2014errors of not\nbeing too careful. If they weren't so, the species would have become extinct. Obviously, some individual deer do end up making the\nfatal error of commission by drinking at watering holes when predators are present, but the species as a whole has done remark-\n\nably well.\n\nIf you have seen African wildlife videos or gone on a safari, you will have noticed how vigilant wildebeests, antelopes,\nzebras, and other herbivores are. They seem to see danger where there is none. But it is this alertness that has allowed them to sur-\n\nvive and thrive for millions of years. A type I error of underestimating a threat could be the last error one of these animals makes.\n\f"}, "001773.png": {"text": "The second kind of type I error that the deer can commit is seen in mating rituals. One fascinating sight in the wild for me,\nand dare I say for the female deer, is two adult male deer fighting over the exclusive control of a harem. Let me describe the mating\nbehavior of the red deer found in many parts of Europe and in western and central Asia.\u2018 The males are called stags, and the fe-\nmales hinds. The hinds live in groups called harems. Stags, armed with impressively large antlers, \u201cfight\u201d with one another to gain\nexclusive mating rights to the harem females. I have put the word \u201cfight\u201d in quotation marks because the stags rarely end up fight-\ning physically. A type I error, or the error of commission, in this scenario would be the mistake of committing to fighting, thereby\nrisking becoming injured or disabled. Although the prize of a harem is quite substantial, the stags show extreme sensitivity to the\ntype I error by dueling very rarely. Here is how it works.\n\nStags are capable of mating when they reach the age of about sixteen months, but they don\u2019t usually mate for the first time\nuntil they are at least six years old. This is because they don\u2019t develop large and powerful antlers before this age. They could fight\nand take a chance, but none do. They could get seriously hurt, which could compromise their fitness for future mating or even\ntheir life.\n\nWhen they do reach mating age, they approach the rutting grounds where hinds have gathered. But they don\u2019t start fighting\nimmediately. Scientists have observed that locking antlers is almost always the last resort, and a rutting stag will typically fight\nonly five times during the three weeks of the rut. A series of highly choreographed rituals that serve to actively discourage phys-\nical contact precedes the locking of horns. When two stags challenge each other, one emits an impressive roar. The other then\nresponds with seemingly equal vigor, because sound quality is a reliable indicator of the strength of one\u2019s rival. The roaring may go\non for more than an hour, with the number of roars peaking at three to four per minute. At this stage, based on the quality of roars,\none of the stags typically withdraws.\n\nIf they are unable to decide their relative strengths based on roars, they move on to the next stage of the \u201cfight\u201d by walking\nwith stiff legs parallel to each other. Yes, they threaten their opponent by walking! This parallel walking spectacle lasts many min-\n\nutes during which time the rivals assess each other\u2019s strength and physical condition from a distance of about two meters. During\n\f"}, "001774.png": {"text": "this period, they also thrash the vegetation and roar to appear more intimidating to their rival. Again, one may choose to withdraw\nat this stage. Only if both stags refuse to back down do they choose to clash antlers. To me, it seems more like a push-and-shove\nmatch. This \u201cshow\u201d\u2014most of these interactions don\u2019t look like a real brawl\u2014can last several minutes, at the end of which one stag\n\nadmits defeat and runs away.\n\nIf this were a human boxing match, the crowd would trash the arena because the boxers would be screaming and hitting\nthe ground instead of each other! Stags have found great evolutionary success because at each stage of the contest, they minimize\nthe error of committing self-harm: They do not even attempt to duel until they have big enough antlers, and even after acquiring\ntheir deadly weapons, they refuse to engage until they believe they have more than a fair chance of winning. Even their duel is not\n\ndeadly\u2014scientists have observed that only about 5 percent of rutting stags receive permanent injuries.\n\nThe bottom line is that the stags\u2019 evolutionary success, at least in part, can be attributed to their instinct to preserve life and\n\nlimb\u2014to minimize the risk of committing a type I error.\n\nBut there is a significant trade-off to the approach of minimizing the risk of type I errors: the deer make many more type II\nerrors. A type II error, or the error of omission, means avoiding a watering hole where no predator is waiting. Stags also too often\nwithdraw from a rutting duel when they have a good chance of winning the harem. The cost is the lost opportunity to drink water\n\nor to mate.\n\nIn some cases, a type II error may turn out to be a fatal mistake. A thirsty deer may not be able to run quickly enough to\nescape a predator, and an overcautious stag may not get to pass his genes on to the next generation. But on average, making this\ntrade-off in favor of reducing the number of errors of self-harm while tolerating a higher number of errors of rejecting potential\nbenefit has worked quite well for the species.\n\nCommitting a type I error can be and has been deadlier than the loss of a single animal\u2014it can lead to the extinction of\nan entire species. The flightless dodo bird, a native of Mauritius, was first spotted by sailors in 1507 and went extinct by 1681.5\n\nDodos were bigger than turkeys, and since they had no natural predators on the isolated island, they were not afraid of the human.\n\f"}, "001775.png": {"text": "invaders. They committed the cardinal type I error\u2014they did not avoid the humans when they should have\u2014which led to their\nextinction.\n\nLet\u2019s now turn our attention to the predator. The predator, too, can make two types of error: It can commit itself to killing\nprey that turns out to be too dangerous or too large or too fast (type I error), or it can refrain from attacking prey that it could easily\nhave killed (type II error).\n\nWhich error do you think a predator makes more often?\n\nAcheetah is the fastest mammal on Earth and routinely achieves speeds of eighty to one hundred kilometers per hour while\nchasing prey.\u2018 It sacrifices size and bulk for speed. A cheetah typically weighs 34 to 54 kilograms (75 to 120 pounds), which is\nsignificantly less than a lion, whose weight typically ranges from 170 to 230 kilograms (375 to 500 pounds). Hence, a cheetah usu-\nally preys on smaller animals like birds, rabbits, and small antelopes. A cheetah will never attempt to kill an adult water buffalo, a\nfavorite prey of lions. The cheetah is simply trying to avoid getting hurt. Committing a type I error will lead either to death\u2014water\nbuffalos can turn on their hunters aggressively\u2014or wasted energy\u2014when a cheetah chases an antelope that was too far away to\nbegin with. These mistakes, in turn, will lead to hunger and poorer hunting performance. For a cheetah mother, a type I error can\nalso lead to the death of her offspring. The fact the species has been successful for eons demonstrates that cheetahs, as a species,\nhave not committed too many type I errors. A type II error for a cheetah would mean not chasing prey it should have. This would\nleave the cheetah and maybe even her babies hungry, but they would all live to see another day.\n\nDeer and cheetahs do not manufacture complex decision-tree diagrams with associated probabilities to make decisions in\ntheir lives. These animals do what they do because natural selection has honed their instincts over countless generations. Natural\nselection among animals is incessant and merciless and has produced millions of species, all of whom adhere to this simple princi-\nple: Minimize the risk of committing type I errors to curtail the risk of injury or death, and learn to live with type II errors or fore-\ngone benefits.\n\nWhat about plants, the ultimate source of all life on Earth?\n\f"}, "001776.png": {"text": "Plants have been immensely successful evolutionarily: The first land plants appeared in the Ordovician era about 490\nmillion years ago, and there are about 400,000 plant species found on our green planet.2 Unlike animals, the dramas of whose lives\nplay out on African safaris, on wildlife TV channels, and in children\u2019s books, plants may seem uninteresting, sedate, peaceful, and\n\u201cinactive.\u201d Nothing could be further from the truth. Look closely, and you will notice that the life of a plant, in many ways, is more\nexciting and action-packed than that of almost any animal. Paradoxically, this is because plants can\u2019t move. If they are malnour-\nished, they can\u2019t move to a different location to feed; when attacked by herbivores, they don\u2019t have feet to run or claws to fight back;\n\nwhen infected by pathogens, they can\u2019t be offered treatment and cuddles like we humans can.\n\nPlants can choose to commit resources broadly to two areas: defending against attacks or growing. As with deer and\ncheetahs, any error that significantly compromises life or fitness for a plant can be categorized as a type I error. Since the lack of\na proper defense may prove fatal to a plant, a type I error, or an error of commission, occurs when the plant does not devote re-\nsources to protecting itself. A type II error occurs when a plant directs energy toward preservation when it should have invested\nin growth. This error of omission may not kill the plant but may compromise its ability to grow and reproduce relative to its\n\ncompetitors.\n\nAmple evidence from nature suggests that plants avoid type I errors at the cost of committing more type II errors.! Let\u2019s ex-\n\namine how plants handle insect herbivores.\n\nThe first defense of plants against insects is physical structures like wax, thorns, and trichomes. A trichome is the layer of\nhairs on leaves, stems, and fruits and can be spiral, straight, hooked, or glandular. A dense trichome on a leaf impedes the move-\nment of insects and their larvae, thereby reducing their ability to damage the leaf epidermis. Trichomes in glandular form can\nsecrete poisonous or otherwise harmful chemicals like flavonoids and alkaloids, which repel insects. Some glandular trichomes\n\ncan also trap insects.\n\nProducing and maintaining trichomes is metabolically expensive for a plant and prevents it from making additional leaves,\n\nstems, or fruits. Thus, when there are few or no insects, we should expect trichomes to be tiny or nonexistent. But when there is an\n\f"}, "001777.png": {"text": "insect attack, to reduce the risk of a type I error (erroneously investing in growth instead of preparing defenses), we should expect\nthe plant to start making trichomes. And this is what we see. For example, scientists have observed that when adult leaf beetles\nattack the willow plant, new leaves grown after the attack develop higher trichome density. The willow plant redirects its resources\nfrom growth to defense as a result of sensing a predator. Trichome density also increases in other species like pepperwort and wild\nradish after an insect attack. When a butterfly species attacks a black mustard plant, the trichome density of the plant\u2019s leaves in-\ncreases, as does the production of pungent chemicals called glucosinolates. Within a few days or weeks following an insect attack,\n\ntrichome density can increase from 25 to 1,000 percent!\n\nAplant\u2019s defense mechanisms are not limited to trichomes, however. Lignin is a phenol compound that plays a vital role in\na plant\u2019s defense against insects. Lignin does two things to the leaves: It increases their toughness, thereby making them unpalat-\nable, and it reduces their nutritional content. A leaf with excess lignin would be anathema for insects. Just as with trichomes, it\nis costly to produce lignin. Also as with trichomes, the plant ramps up its lignin production after an insect attack. In addition to\nlignin, compounds called flavonoids, tannins, lectins, and peroxidases also serve to reduce the risk of plants committing type I er-\nrors by directing resources to defense rather than growth.\n\nWhat I have described are direct defenses against pests. But many plants also resort to indirect defenses, which are rarely\n\nseen in animals.\n\nAn indirect defense works on the simple principle that \u201cmy enemy\u2019s enemy is my friend.\u201d2 It works simply\u2014and beautifully\n\u2014like this. When a plant senses an insect attack, it releases some chemical compounds from its leaves, flowers, and fruits into\nthe atmosphere. These chemical compounds attract predators of the insects attacking the plants. For example, plants like lima\nbeans and Arabidopsis release a chemical called methyl salicylate to attract insect predators like big-eyed bugs, ladybird beetles\n(commonly known as ladybugs), and green lacewings. This trick is not limited to the aerial parts of plants. Roots, too, can release\nchemicals that attract underground predators to underground pests. For example, when western corn rootworm threatens maize\n\nplants, the maize roots release a chemical that attracts a nematode species that preys upon the rootworm.\n\f"}, "001778.png": {"text": "When aphids attack, many plants emit a chemical called beta-farnesene. It does not appear to be a coincidence that when\npredators attack aphids, the aphids release this chemical, presumably warning other aphids to stay away. Thus, a plant releasing\n\nbeta-farnesene is equivalent to a deer mimicking a lion roar when attacked by a leopard!\n\nPlants, like animals, have found a way to their spectacular evolutionary success by focusing on reducing their errors of\ncommission. In other words, like their animal counterparts, they avoid taking risks to their life and well-being at the cost of giving up\n\nsome potentially juicy opportunities.\n\nBuffett\u2019s Two Rules of Investing\n\nAs one should expect, Warren Buffett figured out this lesson from evolutionary theory before almost everyone else. He famously\n\ncoined his two rules of investing as follows:\n\nRule number 1: Never lose money.\n\nRule number 2: Never forget rule number 1.12\n\nBut wait a minute. What does he mean by commanding us to \u201cnever lose money\u201d? How can one choose not to lose money?\n\nIsn\u2019t that what every investor wants? Why would any investor deliberately wish to lose money?\n\nIn fact, Buffett seems to have violated his own two rules on many occasions. For example, in 1993, Berkshire bought Dexter\nShoe for $433 million in Berkshire stock. As he detailed in his 2007 annual letter, \u201cWhat I had assessed as a durable competitive\nadvantage vanished within a few years. ... That move made the cost to Berkshire shareholders not $400 million, but rather $3.5\n\nbillion. In essence, I gave away 1.6 percent of a wonderful business\u2014one now valued at $220 billion\u2014to buy a worthless business.\u201d\n\f"}, "001779.png": {"text": "In his 2014 annual letter, he admitted his mistake in Berkshire\u2019s Tesco investment, \u201cWe sold Tesco shares throughout the\nyear and now are out of this position. Our after-tax loss from this investment was $444 million. ...\u201d More recently, in the middle of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic market meltdown, Buffett sold all his airline stocks. He had invested between $7 billion and $8 billion for\nlarge stakes in four airlines: American, Delta, Southwest, and United. Berkshire\u2019s position was worth a bit more than $4 billion at\n\nthe time of his sale. \u201cIt turned out I was wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nBack to Buffett\u2019s two rules. Despite losing money occasionally, what is he asking us to do when he orders us not to lose any?\nBuffett has never explicitly explained this (at least I have never found an explanation), but this is what I think he means: Avoid big\nrisks. Don\u2019t make type I errors. Don\u2019t commit to an investment in which the probability of losing money is higher than the probabil-\n\nity of making money. Think about risk first, not return.\n\nBefore we go any further, allow mea slight digression to get the definition of \u201crisk\u201d out of the way. The definition I use in\nthis book is not the same as the one defined by corporate finance theorists. Finance theory claims that risk is the chance that the\nactual investment return will differ from the expected investment return.12 Thus, if an asset is highly volatile, it will be classified\n\nas riskier than an asset that is not as volatile.\n\nIf you think about this for a moment, you will conclude that this is nonsensical. For any investor, risk should simply be the\nprobability of incurring a capital loss. The following example will make this clear. Let\u2019s say I am evaluating an investment in a\nhigh-quality grocery retailer. The retailer has been performing quite well, resulting in a steadily increasing stock price over the\nyears. Let\u2019s say the market price was $90 in early 2020. After the COVID-19 crisis, the stock market became highly volatile, and the\nmarket price of this business dropped to $30. Let\u2019s also assume that you have done your work and have concluded that grocery\nretailers may benefit from the crisis since consumers will stock up their pantries. Which would be a riskier investment: investing\nin the business at $90 or at $30? If your intuition says $90, you are right. This is because the risk of losing money is greater at $90\nthan at $30. But, believe it or not, academics of finance would argue exactly the opposite! No, Iam not kidding. They would con-\n\nclude that the post-COVID-19 crisis business is riskier because the volatility of the stock price has increased!\n\f"}, "001780.png": {"text": "We at Nalanda never bring stock price volatility into a risk discussion. We define \u201crisk\u201d as the probability of capital loss. The\nhigher the probability of loss, the higher the risk. If my investment in Company A is likely to lose more money over my investment\n\nin Company B, I will deem Company A to be \u201criskier\u201d than Company B irrespective of past or future volatility in their stock prices.\n\nAs Buffett\u2019s diktat shows, he is focused on minimizing risk and, in doing so, has become the envy of the entire investment\nworld, which seems obsessed with running after every half-baked business idea. Buffett and the natural world are fixated on min-\nimizing the risk of type I errors. Should we follow them blindly? Will the explicit lesson from Buffett and the implicit one from\n\nleopards and legumes work for ordinary mortals like us?\n\nWhy or why not?\n\nA Great Investor Is a Great Rejector\n\nLet\u2019s walk through a simple example that contrasts two different investment styles. And let\u2019s then see if Buffett\u2019s advice makes\nsense. According to data from the World Bank, the United States had 4,400 listed companies in 2018.12 For simplicity, let\u2019s assume\naround 4,000. First, we need to decide how many of these are \u201cgood investments.\u201d Let\u2019s keep it simple and classify a \u201cgood invest-\nment\u201d as one that will make us a decent return over the long run. It has a competent and honest management team, a modest\ngrowth rate, makes enough money, and has low leverage. If you are a finance nerd, you are probably bristling at this moment.\nWhat in the world do I mean by vague terms like \u201cdecent,\u201d \u201cenough,\u201d and \u201ccompetent\u201d? Don\u2019t worry, we will get into numbers\n\nshortly, but at this stage, let\u2019s just say we know a good investment when we see it.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that 25 percent of the listed universe comprises \u201cgood investments.\u201d If you talk to practitioners\u2014that is, actual\ninvestors\u2014you will not get a number too far from this percentage. In any event, the exact percentage is less significant, as we will\nsee. Thus, we can say there are 1,000 good investments and 3,000 bad investments in the U.S. listed universe by this logic. Again,\n\ndon\u2019t get too pained about this strict dichotomy; it is serving a purpose that we will get to.\n\f"}, "001781.png": {"text": "Let\u2019s say you encounter a savvy investor who claims that he is right 80 percent of the time in his investment decisions (it is\nusually a \u201che\u201d; we men are evolutionarily programmed for empty exaggerations). Stated differently, if he encounters a bad invest-\nment (i.e., one in which he will not make any money), he rejects it 80 percent of the time. If he sees a good investment (i.e., one in\nwhich he will make money), he makes a favorable investment decision 80 percent of the time. Thus, his rates of type I and type II\nerrors are both 20 percent. If this star investor makes an investment decision, what is the probability that it is a good investment?\nYou'd say 80 percent, right? Wrong. The answer is 57 percent. But why? Isn\u2019t he right 80 percent of the time? How can we go from\n80 percent to 57 percent?\n\nHere is how.\n\nThere are 1,000 good investments in the market, and since this investor makes a type II error 20 percent of the time (i.\n\n \n\nhe mistakenly rejects 20 percent of these), he will select only 800 companies from his list.

The reason is simple, especially when we incorporate our prior knowledge of the\nbusiness world: There are very few good investments in the market.\n\nLet me repeat this statement, which is the bedrock of our philosophy and that of the rest of this book: There are very few good\n\ninvestments in the market.\n\f"}, "001782.png": {"text": "As we have just seen, the prevalence of type I and type II errors can lull us investors into thinking that we are better than we\nreally are.

Thus, from the 3,000 bad investments in the market, he will select only 300 businesses (10\npercent x 3,000). As his type II error rate remains 20 percent, he will erroneously reject 200 of the 1,000 good investments, thereby\nselecting 800 investments. Thus, Investor A has selected 1,100 investments (300 + 800), but only 800 of these are good. In this\nscenario, Investor A\u2019s probability of selecting a good investment improves from 57 percent to 73 percent (800 + 1,100). I assume\nyou will admit that this is quite a dramatic improvement in his success rate.\n\nInvestor B, unlike Investor A, is more focused on not missing out on good opportunities. He chooses to reduce his rate of type\nIl errors from 20 percent to 10 percent and keeps his rate of type I errors at 20 percent.

Thus, Investor B\u2019s probability of se-\nlecting a good business improves from 57 percent to 60 percent (900 = 1,500). This is an improvement\u2014but only by 3 percentage\n\npoints.

On the other hand, reducing the rate of type II errors by the same amount improves performance by only 3\npercentage points.\n\nGuess what happens if another investor, Investor C, improves his rate of both type I and type II errors from 20 percent to 10\npercent. I was flabbergasted when I first saw the answer: 75 percent. This is barely above the 73 percent achieved by Investor A,\nwho was focused only on reducing type I errors.

I also should have dug deeper\ninto the veracity of the criticisms of the promoter. I didn't do either of these things. It was too late by the time we discovered this\nindividual\u2019s shenanigans; he had sucked the company dry, and Warburg lost almost all its money.

More often than not, the dream scenario hyped up by\n\nthe management morphs into a nightmare.\n\nOccasionally, the board or the owner fires the previous CEO and brings in a new one to turn around a struggling business.\nThe new CEO usually comes with an impressive resume, and many are highly qualified. But we don\u2019t bet on these turnarounds ei-\nther. An exceptional CEO was impressive in a certain context with a certain business\u2014this context and this business are different.\nHow are we to know that the new CEO, faced with a set of challenges they have almost certainly never met before, will do what\n\nthey are promising to do? We don't.\n\nI know what you are thinking. The upside, if we were able to detect a genuine turnaround, would be significant. Agreed. Let\u2019s\nassess the following two situations.\n\nCase 1: Acompany that has been very profitable over many decades has recently fallen prey to smaller and more nimble\n\ncompetitors. It has suffered massive losses over the past two years. The company sells its highly engineered products to medium\n\f"}, "001788.png": {"text": "and large businesses. The board starts searching for a new CEO and identifies a promising candidate. There are, however, a few\nworrying problems with this choice: The candidate does not understand technology, he does not understand how to sell to busi-\nnesses because he has run a company that sells biscuits to consumers (!), and he has had no experience turning around any busi-\nness, let alone a complex engineering one like this.\n\nWould you invest in this business once this CEO takes over?\n\nCase 2: A venerated hundred-year-old department store has been struggling with falling sales. Over the past four years, sales\nhave fallen 10 percent from $20 billion to $18 billion, and the operating income has plummeted about 65 percent from $1.1 billion\nto $380 million. The stock price has crashed from $81 to $32.\n\nThe board appoints one of the world\u2019s leading retail experts as the new CEO of this business. He has had two great successes\nin the past few years. As VP of merchandising at one of the largest U.S. retailers, he made the store appeal to young and trendy\nconsumers. He also struck several designer partnerships that were a huge hit with shoppers. His next job was at a large company\nwhere he was responsible for opening retail stores. He hit the ball completely out of the park. The sales per square foot at these\nstores now exceeds even luxury retailers like LVMH. His innovations in design and service at these stores were so popular that\n\nshoppers now need to book an appointment many days in advance in many cities across the world.\nWould you invest in this business once this CEO takes over?\nI would not buy the shares of the first business but would load up on the second. I assume, dear reader, that you would do\n\nthe same. We would both be dead wrong. You and I would have missed out on a seven-fold increase in stock price over the next ten\n\nyears in the first business. We would have been wiped out completely\u2014yes, with a 100 percent loss\u2014in the second.\n\nThe first business is IBM, and its famous turnaround in the late 1990s was led by Lou Gerstner, the ex-CEO of RJR Nabisco.1&\nPreviously called International Business Machines, IBM was a behemoth that ruled the world of technology in the latter half of the\ntwentieth century. In the early 1990s, about half its revenues came from huge mainframe computers sold to businesses. These\n\nmainframes had hardware and software bundled into one system. The world, however, was fast shifting to smaller and midsized\n\f"}, "001789.png": {"text": "machines running on microprocessors. The technology universe was witnessing the unbundling of hardware and software with\ndifferent vendors specializing in each segment. Companies like HP, Sun, Compaq, and Dell were eating IBM\u2019s lunch on hardware,\n\nand Microsoft and Oracle were starting to dominate software.\n\nTo make matters worse, individual consumers had started buying personal computers, in which IBM had no expertise\nor experience. The company also had a huge internal bureaucracy that hobbled decision-making. From being the second most\n\nprofitable company in the world in 1990, IBM lost $16 billion between 1991 and 1993.\n\nLou Gerstner seemed like a strange choice for the board to make. But it worked wonders. Gerstner resorted to a massive cut\nin expenses by laying off staff, sold many assets to raise cash, transformed the organizational culture to encourage business units\nto cooperate and not compete, linked the compensation of senior managers to overall company performance, created a single\nbrand message for all units of IBM, and much more. IBM\u2019s stock price jumped seven times from $13 to $77 during his tenure from\nApril 1, 1993, to December 31, 2002. If you want to learn more about Gerstner\u2019s miracles, I urge you to read his book Who Says Ele-\n\nphants Can\u2019t Dance? Inside IBM\u2019s Historic Turnaround.\n\nThe second business is JCPenney, where Ron Johnson, credited with transforming Target and creating the iconic Apple\nStores, was brought in as CEO in late 2011.12 The stock price jumped 24 percent at the news! The market was betting that Johnson\nwould be the miracle cure for JCPenney. He changed everything at the company\u2014the logo, the store design, the advertisements,\nthe pricing model, and the popular private labels. JCPenney was known for coupons and clearance sales\u2014Johnson ended them.\nBig mistake. In 2012, sales dropped 25 percent, from $17 billion to $13 billion, as customers abandoned the stores en masse. More\nworryingly, the company suffered an operating loss of $1.3 billion. The board fired Johnson in mid-2013, just seventeen months\nafter installing him as CEO. The stock price had dropped 60 percent during his short tenure. JCPenney never recovered from this\n\nfiasco and filed for bankruptcy in May 2020.\n\nIf we could not predict the fate of turnaround efforts at what appeared to be slam-dunk cases (IBM and JCPenney), what hope\n\ndo we have in situations that don\u2019t seem so clear cut?

How could the probability of success at a troubled company be anything but minuscule?\n\nAnd if so, why would we indulge in the fantasy?\n\nDetesting Debt\n\nAs a consultant in the early 1990s, I almost always focused on the profit-and-loss (P&L) account. Revenue, cost, profit. Almost\nnothing else mattered. Remarkably, a consultant\u2019s P&L obsession remains intact. My niece is currently a consultant in London\nand primarily serves private equity clients. She is hyper-focused on just one aspect of P&L: EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax,\ndepreciation, and amortization). P&L obsession is not limited to consultants. Read any analyst report or listen to conference call\n\nrecordings that discuss quarterly results. You will be inundated with comments and questions on revenues, costs, and profit.\n\nAfter many years of investing, I realized that I needed to focus as much, if not more, on the company\u2019s balance sheet. Re-\nceivables, inventory, payables, fixed assets. And most important of all, debt. Corporate finance theory has a thing for leverage. For\nthose of you who are not familiar with it, finance academics claim that companies need to have an \u201coptimal\u201d level of leverage to\nimprove returns. If a company can borrow money to purchase assets, its return on equity and earnings per share should improve.\nMathematically, this is undoubtedly true. Realistically, this is undoubtedly dangerous.\n\nWhat could be more important than improving short-term return on equity and earnings per share for a business? In my\n\nview, two things.\n\nStart with the easy one. Survival. There is no point in improving return on equity by a few percentage points if it compro-\nmises long-term survival. The COVID-19 crisis demonstrated clearly that the companies caught with their pants down were the\nones with substantial leverage. In the second quarter of 2020, the following are just some of the well-known companies that an-\nnounced bankruptcy: Gold\u2019s Gym, Hertz, Intelsat, J. Crew, JCPenney, Neiman Marcus, and Sur La Table.12 Here is what is common\n\nacross all these names: All had a large amount of debt. It is not impossible for an unleveraged business to go belly up, but it sure is\n\f"}, "001791.png": {"text": "quite hard. If I were to list the twenty biggest bankruptcies in the United States,2\u00b0 you would notice that allJ\u2014with Lehman at the\ntop and LyondellBasell at number 20\u2014were heavily indebted.\n\nOne might argue that these businesses were unlucky and that everything would have been fine if there had been no\nCOVID-19. One might also contend that mismanagement or other factors contributed more to their downfall than debt. And that\n\u201ccorrelation is not causation.\u201d Maybe. But it\u2019s one hell of a correlation. As a long-term investor in a business, I don\u2019t want the com-\npany ever to go bankrupt\u2014whether the times are good or bad. I can live with a slightly lower return on equity and lower earnings-\nper-share (EPS) growth, but at least I will live.\n\nNot having high leverage probably makes sense to everyone. But the following may not: I am an advocate of no leverage.\nMore than 90 percent of our portfolio companies have\u2014and have always had\u2014excess cash. Only three businesses out of about\n\nthirty in our portfolio have some debt. But even this debt is quite small\u2014the maximum debt/equity ratio among these three is 0.3.\n\nWhy would I demand zero debt when a modest level would not compromise the survival of the business? The answer lies in\n\nthe following Business Insider headline: \u201cNo Layoff, Asian Paints Will Give Salary Increments to Boost Employees Morale.\u201d2\n\nAsian Paints is India\u2019s largest paints business and probably one of the country\u2019s best-run businesses. As an aside, it is sadly\nnot in our portfolio. I had a chance to buy it during the global financial crisis of 2008, but I refused to pay 15 percent more for the\n\nprivilege of owning this marvelous compounder. I was a fool. Anyway, let\u2019s return to a more pleasant topic.\n\nThis \u201cno-layoff, salary increment\u201d story would not be newsworthy in normal times. But this announcement was made\non May 15, 2020. At the time, India had been under an almost complete lockdown since mid-March as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic. Every business was witnessing a catastrophic decline in revenues and profits. Also, no one had any visibility as to when\nthe situation would improve\u2014remember that the possibility of vaccines wasn\u2019t even on the horizon in May 2020. Asian Paints was\nitself going through a catastrophic quarter\u2014during the period from April to June 2020, the company\u2019s revenue declined by 43 per-\n\ncent, and its net profit went down by 67 percent compared to the same period in 2019. Was the company foolish to be increasing\n\f"}, "001792.png": {"text": "salaries in this period? No. Just cash rich. In March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, the company had $220 million cash (its rev-\nenue for the year ended March 2020 was $2.9 billion).\n\nWhich brings me to the second reason I detest any debt. This answer is often underappreciated and even ignored by\ninvestors and management. It is this: Debt diminishes strategic flexibility and hence long-term value creation. For a day trader or\neven an investor whose holding period ranges from three to five years, a reasonable amount of leverage may not matter. But for a\n\npermanent owner like Nalanda, any constraint that prevents a business from taking calculated strategic bets is undesirable.\n\nAsian Paints is the leader in the highly competitive Indian paints industry; its competitors can and do copy what the\nbusiness is trying to do. However, every few years, the company gets an opportunity to make an investment or take a strategic bet\nthat its competitors find hard to emulate. The salary increase was one such bet. But it did not stop there. The company sanitized\nits dealers\u2019 paint shops without charging any fees, offered medical insurance to its painters, gave forty-five-day extensions on pay-\nments to its dealers, and announced relief worth more than $5 million to its contractors. The CEO, Amit Syngle, pointed out, \u201cWe\n\nhave been debt free for years and are quite comfortably placed even if the uncertainty goes on for the next four or five months.\u201d22\n\nThe impact of the company\u2019s largesse may not be felt in the short term, but the long-term impact is likely to be significant.\nAsian Paints was able to commit to these highly unusual actions only because\u2014apart from their exceptional strategic vision\u2014\nthey had no debt.\n\nThe global pandemic is an extreme case, and one may assert that it would be foolhardy to keep excess cash on hand for a\nonce-in-a-century event. But this premise is false. Bad things happen to businesses at remarkably regular intervals. The harsh\nreality of companies in any capitalist society\u2014and the reason to always have cash\u2014is not that things can go wrong, but that they\ndo go wrong. Businesses suffer adversity across a wide range of situations: The macroeconomic environment can become a stiff\nheadwind as in the global financial crisis of 2008 or a recession; the industry can suffer a cyclical downturn; a well-funded com-\npetitor can start overspending on advertising or giving discounts; the company can lose some of its best employees to competitors;\n\none or more major customers can leave or go belly up; consumer tastes can suddenly change; a large strategic acquisition or invest-\n\f"}, "001793.png": {"text": "ment may not pay off; a factory can catch fire or a supplier may get in trouble; currency can move adversely in a foreign market\nthat contributes to significant sales; regulations can get in the way; the company can get sued for a significant amount. I could go\n\nonandon.\n\nNone of these issues is hypothetical\u2014I have seen all of these happen to our portfolio companies over more than two decades\nof investing. Occasionally, two or more problems can arise simultaneously, putting significant pressure on businesses. While\nworrying about market share loss, low supplier commitment, competitor aggression, and employee dissatisfaction, the last thing\nmanagement should worry about is interest payments. In my experience, only when the financial risk is low can management\n\nfocus on mitigating business risks.\n\nIhave always maintained that the notion of an \u201coptimal\u201d capital structure that requires companies to have leverage, which\nis espoused by corporate finance theorists, is not just wrong but dangerous. A strong balance sheet is not the one that maximizes\n\ndebt to minimize the cost of capital but the one that minimizes debt to maximize the safety of capital.\n\nFortunately, none of the owners of Nalanda portfolio companies studied finance at fancy business schools.\n\nIgnoring M&A Junkies\n\nNothing happens in well-oiled businesses on a day-to-day basis. Sorry, a lot happens, but it\u2019s largely mundane, repetitive, uninter-\nesting, dull, and monotonous. And this is the way it should be. Imagine the day-to-day operations of a business that sells bars of\nbath soap. Here is a typical day or week or month or year: The factory manufactures bars of soap in the thousands and performs\nquality control checks to reject defects; the packing department stacks the bars in boxes; logistics ensures timely shipping at pre-\nagreed costs; warehouses stock the boxes in assigned positions; last-mile delivery delivers the bars on time; and the finance depart-\n\nment records the payments received from the retailers.

No excitement.\n\f"}, "001794.png": {"text": "What would be the best way for such a business\u2014or any business for that matter\u2014to get reported on in the Wall Street\nJournal or the Financial Times? M&A. In industry parlance, \u201cmergers and acquisitions.\u201d For some reason, the media love the news\nof one business merging with or acquiring another one.

Most mergers and acquisitions fail.\n\nHere are the statements made by the CEOs of AOL and Time Warner when they announced their $350 billion (!) merger on\nJanuary 10, 2000. Stephen Case, the cofounder of AOL, proudly proclaimed, \u201cThis is a historic moment when new media has truly\ncome of age.\u201d Not to be left behind, Gerald Levin, the CEO of Time Warner, gushed philosophically that the internet had begun\nto \u201ccreate unprecedented and instantaneous access to every form of media and to unleash immense possibilities for economic\ngrowth, human understanding and creative expression.\u201d The result of this bromance?

Yes, \u201cbillion\u201d with a \u201cb.\u201d The market value\nof AOL went from $226 billion in 2000 to $20 billion in 2002. In June 2015, it was acquired for a mere $4.4 billion by Verizon.\n\nGo ahead and blame me for cherry-picking. Guilty as charged. But think about this. AOL and Time Warner were undisputed\nleaders in their industries. They had highly regarded CEOs, their boards were exemplary, their financial position was rock solid,\nthey employed supremely talented and motivated staff, they had access to the best consultants, and yet they failed. Miserably. If\nthey couldn\u2019t hack it, what chance do most companies have? The sad fact is the disastrous AOL Time Warner saga plays out thou-\n\nsands of times every year. And an even sadder fact is that everyone knows about it.\n\nThere is a Jot of literature available on the high failure rate of M&A.24 A Harvard Business Review article by Clayton Chris-\ntensen and others titled \u201cThe Big Idea: The New M&A Playbook\u201d claims that 70 to 90 percent of mergers and acquisitions fail; a\nKPMG study claims that 83 percent of merger deals did not create value; a Cornell University research article declares that \u201can\n\nabundance of empirical research has examined the performance of acquirers across all industries and in general has failed to\n\f"}, "001795.png": {"text": "find consistent evidence of improvements in value after the acquisition\u201d; an Organizational Dynamics research article by Toby J.\nTetenbaum asserts that 60 to 80 percent of all mergers are financial failures; and a study by Great Prairie Group cites studies from\nMcKinsey, Harvard Business School, Bain, and the Wharton School to state that the M&A failure rate is over 70 percent. In all these\nstudies, the reasons for failure include culture mismatch, overpayment, misevaluation of the opportunity, external factors, and in-\ntegration problems, among many others.\n\nBut they don\u2019t point out the single biggest reason we detest M&A: opportunity cost. Let\u2019s visit the German giant Bayer to un-\n\nderstand this reason.\n\nDr. Marijn Dekkers, the chair of Bayer AG, had every reason to be proud in 2015. During his five years as chair, this life sci-\nences company has grown revenue from \u20ac35 billion to \u20ac46 billion, and its EPS had more than tripled from \u20ac1.6 per share to \u20ac5 per\nshare. It continued its reign as the largest company on the German stock exchange with a market value of about \u20ac140 billion. The\n2015 annual report was replete with good news. Without being boastful, Dr. Dekker\u2019s excellent commentary made it evident that\nthe company was one of the world\u2019s leading life sciences businesses.\n\nThe only piece of bad news was tucked away on page seven of the report. Dr. Dekkers wrote, \u201cThis is my last Chairman\u2019s Let-\nter to you as CEO of Bayer.\u201d\n\nHow bad was Dr. Dekker\u2019s revelation for Bayer? In 2020, its sales had fallen to \u20ac41 billion from \u20ac46 billion in 2015; from\nbeing a highly profitable business with a return on equity of 18 percent in 2015, it declared a net loss of \u20ac10 billion; and its divi-\ndend per share was 20 percent lower than in 2015. Oh, and by June 2021, less than six years after the glorious year of 2015, Bayer\u2019s\nmarket value had declined by 65 percent to \u20ac50 billion.\n\nWhat happened? Within ten days of Dr. Dekker\u2019s departure, Bayer made a bid to acquire Monsanto, the U.S. agrochemical\ngiant. Bayer ended up paying $63 billion for the acquisition, which was more than Bayer\u2019s market value in June 2021!\n\nIf you read reports on the reasons for this disaster, most will focus on Bayer losing multiple lawsuits and incurring billions\n\nin damages because plaintiffs were able to convince the U.S. courts that Monsanto\u2019s Roundup weed killer causes cancer. The reports\n\f"}, "001796.png": {"text": "aren\u2019t wrong, but they missed the real value destroyer invisible in the Bayer-Monsanto transaction, and the reason we abhor al-\nmost all M&A: opportunity cost. Stated simply, most analyses of M&A failure focus on the bad things that happened, rather than\non the good things that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nLet\u2019s see what Bayer may have missed doing by making a gargantuan acquisition. These actions (and inactions) fall into\n\nthree categories: divestiture of attractive businesses, reduced focus on existing businesses, and missed opportunities.\n\nAfter acquiring Monsanto, Bayer had to divest many of its core businesses for two reasons. First, regulators forced them to do\nso because both companies were large players in the agrochemical sector. Second, Bayer had to pay down the huge debt they had\n\nincurred to finance the deal. Bayer\u2019s net debt had gone up ten times from \u20ac3.6 billion in 2017 to \u20ac36 billion in 2018!\n\nIn 2017, Bayer divested large parts of its seed and herbicide businesses for \u20ac6 billion. In 2018, it sold its 60 percent stake in\na highly lucrative business called Currenta for \u20ac1 billion and sold the consumer brands Coppertone and Dr. Scholl\u2019s. In 2020, Bayer\nexited its leading and highly profitable Animal Health business for \u20ac7 billion. If we add up the sale value of these divestitures,\nthat\u2019s at least \u20ac15 billion, or about 30 percent of Bayer\u2019s market value in mid-2021. These businesses had been owned and run by\nBayer for decades, and so it is possible that the market was assigning a much higher value than \u20ac15 billion to them when they were\ninside Bayer. The future benefit from these attractive businesses was lost forever. The geese laying golden eggs were slaughtered to\nbuy a hen that refused to lay any eggs.\n\nThe second major opportunity cost is a reduced focus on existing businesses because of the distraction of a bad acquisition.\nYou can see this in Bayer\u2019s annual reports of 2018, 2019, and 2020, in which a lot of ink was expended on justifying the acquisition\n\nand on steps being taken to mitigate the disaster. As usual, numbers tell a better story, as I will explain next.\n\nBayer has three business divisions: pharmaceuticals, consumer health, and crop science. From 2016 to 2020, the sales of\nits pharma division stayed flat at around \u20ac16 billion to \u20ac17 billion. (Although 2020 was the year of COVID, most global pharma\ncompanies did not experience a decline in sales.) Could this stagnation have been due to the acquisition distraction? From 2010\n\nto 2015, pharma sales had more than doubled from \u20ac6.6 billion to \u20ac13.7 billion. From 2015 to 2020, rather than assuming a dou-\n\f"}, "001797.png": {"text": "bling of sales, let\u2019s consider a modest 50 percent increase in a scenario in which management was not being compelled to fight\nfires. This would have led to pharma sales of \u20ac21 billion. The actual number was \u20ac17 billion. I think it\u2019s fair to assume that Bayer\u2019s\npharma division \u201clost\u201d sales of \u20ac4 billion as a result of the Monsanto acquisition. The market value of global pharma companies\n\nis about three to five times sales. Let\u2019s be conservative and take a 2.5-times multiple. This is an opportunity cost of at least \u20ac10\n\nbillion.\n\nThe operating income of Bayer\u2019s consumer health division declined from \u20ac1.2 billion in 2015 to \u20ac0.8 billion in 2019 (let\u2019s\nignore 2020, when many consumer businesses were affected by COVID). Most global consumer businesses grew their operating\nincome during this period. Similarly, the operating income of Bayer\u2019s crop science division fell from \u20ac2.1 billion to \u20ac1.9 billion\nduring this period while its competitors did much better. And remember that Monsanto\u2019s acquisition is counted in the crop science\n\ndivision, and so despite the $63 billion acquisition, the operating income of the division fell from 2015 to 2019!\n\nIn 2015, the operating income of the consumer health and crop science divisions added up to a little more than half the\nconsolidated operating income of Bayer. Thus, we can conservatively assume that at least a third of Bayer\u2019s value in 2015 was\nderived from these two divisions. Since Bayer\u2019s value was \u20ac140 billion in 2015, we can assign a value of at least \u20ac45 billion to \u20ac50\nbillion to these divisions for 2015 (which was the total value of Bayer in June 2021). What was the opportunity cost of the under-\nperformance of these two divisions? If the top management had not been consumed by Monsanto's unending troubles, and if they\nhad enhanced their 2015 value by 30 to 50 percent over the next five years, we see a likely missed gain of around \u20ac15 billion to \u20ac25\n\nbillion.\n\nLet\u2019s now come to the third, and probably the largest, opportunity cost: missed opportunities. For Bayer, this was not making\n\na COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nImagine the end of 2019 at Bayer. The company\u2019s leverage has multiplied more than nine times since 2017 to \u20ac34 billion,\nthe U.S. litigation is getting uglier and more costly by the month, the return on capital is down to less than 4 percent from the high\n\nteens a few years earlier, and the investors are as angry as hell with the stock price falling to half its peak, also a few years earlier.\n\f"}, "001798.png": {"text": "And then COVID strikes in early 2020. Do you think the senior management assembled around the table at corporate head-\nquarters and said, \u201cLet\u2019s bet billions on developing a vaccine that we do not even know is possible\u201d? Would the Bayer management\nhave been willing to take a bet on an uncertain outcome given their dire operating and financial condition? We will never know for\n\nsure, and your guess is as good as mine, but a shot in the dark for an uncertain payoff by this long-suffering company? Unlikely.\n\nBayer\u2019s 2020 annual report mentions that they signed an agreement with a biotech company to develop and manufacture a\nCOVID-19 vaccine that would be launched in 2022. Meanwhile, four competitors of Bayer\u2014AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Mod-\n\nerna, and Pfizer\u2014had administered about five billion doses by July 2021.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine contributes to almost all of Moderna\u2019s revenues and profits, and so Moderna is a good candidate to use\nto assess the notional loss for Bayer. From December 2019 (before the pandemic hit) until July 2021, Moderna added about $120\nbillion (\u20ac100 billion) to its market value. If we assume that the probability of Bayer\u2019s success would have been 50 to 75 percent\n(after all, it was one of the global leaders), Bayer has foregone \u20ac50 billion to \u20ac75 billion in value creation owing to its inability (or\n\nwas it its unwillingness?) to develop a vaccine.\n\nIf we add up all these numbers, the opportunity cost of Monsanto\u2019s acquisition is probably in the range of \u20ac90 billion to \u20ac100\nbillion. In other words, instead of about \u20ac50 billion in June 2021, Bayer could have been valued at \u20ac140 billion to \u20ac150 billion. How\ndo we know this is not a massive overstatement? Because Bayer\u2019s value in 2015 was \u20ac140 billion. If anything, this opportunity cost\ncalculation is a significant understatement because it assumes almost no additional value creation since 2015, while every other\n\nmajor pharmaceutical, consumer, and agrochemical business has added significant value since 2015.\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about Bayer\u2019s management, but presumably they are world class given their outsized success before\n2016. If that\u2019s the case, how did they get lulled into making such an acquisition? Because like most acquirers across the world, they\ngenuinely believed that this time, it\u2019s different. Managers\u2014especially high-performing ones\u2014and their advisers have a sense of\ninvincibility and arrogance when evaluating a target.

Our counsel to them is to be deeply skeptical of the\npotential value creation in all cases. I will admit that the success rate of our advice has not been very high.

Railways allowed people to travel farther at a much\nlower cost and in less time than the alternatives. They also spurred the growth of cities by enabling cheaper and faster transport\nof people and building materials. Many entrepreneurs jumped into the fray and by 1844 had opened more than 2,200 miles of\nrailroad line. The stock market loved these companies, which promised growth forever. Between 1843 and 1850, 442 railway com-\npanies made a public offering of shares. Between January 1, 1843, and August 9, 1845, the index of railway stock prices doubled.\nBut the bubble burst, as they inevitably do. The railway index fell over 67 percent from 1845 to 1850\u2014many companies collapsed.\n\nowing to incompetence, poor financial planning, or fraud.\nNot unlike the railway mania of the 1840s, with the arrival of the internet in the mid-1990s for the masses, venture capi-\n\ntalists and public markets funded hundreds of companies in the rapidly changing landscape. This was called the dot-com boom.2s\nThe NASDAQ index of technology stocks jumped five-fold between 1995 and 2000.

In October 1999, just six months before the bubble burst, the market value of\n199 internet stocks tracked by Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley\u2019s internet analyst, was $450 billion. All these businesses were essen-\ntially start-ups; they had been created in the previous two to five years. More remarkably, their combined revenue was only $21\n\nbillion, and their cumulative loss was a staggering $6.2 billion. When discussing the initial public offering (IPO) of Priceline.com,\n\n \n\na venture capitalist at Benchmark admitted, \u201cWe're in an environment where the company doesn\u2019t have to be successful for us to\n\nmake money.\u201d\n\nThe year 2000 marked the end of this insanity. By the year 2005, listed Silicon Valley companies had lost two-thirds of\ntheir value from market peak; this was equivalent to a staggering $2 trillion loss of shareholder wealth. Venture capital funding\ncollapsed from about $105 billion in 2000 to $21 billion in 2004. Nasdaq had reached its peak in March 2000. It took more than fif-\n\nteen years for it to regain this level.\n\nYou can now guess the answer to the question I raised at the beginning of this section: The common thread that binds\neighteenth-century railways and twentieth-century dot-coms is the potential for enormous value destruction wrought by a fast-\nchanging industry.\n\nThere are many similar examples in India of various new and upcoming industries that catch the fancy of investors. When\nNalanda was established in 2007, the infrastructure boom was at its peak, and some of the leading companies were valued at\nbillions of dollars. The Indian government had finally begun focusing on building roads, airports, power plants, and ports, and\nprivate and public equity investors seemed to have an unlimited appetite for these companies. But the infrastructure business in\nIndia was in a fledgling state in the late 2000s, the regulations were nascent and untested, and the basis of long-term success was\nunclear. The ensuing value destruction assumed epic proportions. Two of the affected infrastructure businesses were Reliance\nPower and Jaiprakash Power Ventures, whose market values were $29 billion and $23 billion, respectively, in early 2008. Each was\n\nvalued at less than $700 million at the end of 2021, a collapse of more than 97 percent.\n\f"}, "001801.png": {"text": "The Indian public equity market has witnessed similar booms and busts across other rapidly evolving industries like retail,\nreal estate, education, and microfinance. Private equity has gone wild for nonbank finance companies (NBFCs), new-age e-com-\n\nmerce businesses like food and grocery delivery, and software-as-a-service and digital education companies, to name just a few.\n\nSome companies in industries that change fast ultimately do end up creating a lot of value. But very few companies. The\nonly ones that have created truly significant value from the dot-com era are Amazon and Google (Facebook was founded in 2004).\nIf you want to be charitable, you could add eBay and Priceline (now called Booking Holdings). But that\u2019s it. Just step back and think\nabout this for a moment. Only a handful of businesses from the 1995-2000 bubble have prospered. To give you a sense of the scale\nof destruction, 546 IPOs successfully raised $69 billion in 1999 alone. What would have been the probability of finding the next\nwinner?\n\nThe path to creating wealth in rapidly evolving industries is treacherous, and we refuse to walk on it. Many investors are\nslaves to the famous quote of the hockey legend Wayne Gretzky: \u201cI skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.\u201d22\nIam not one of them. I am just not that smart. In fast-changing industries, I have no idea who will win, when, or how. And to draw\n\nthe parallel with hockey, since I don\u2019t know where the puck is going to be, I refuse to play.\n\nWe at Nalanda love stable, predictable, boring industries. Give us electric fans over electric vehicles, boilers over biotech,\nsanitaryware over semiconductors, and enzymes over e-commerce. We like industries in which the winners and losers have been\n\nlargely sorted out and the rules of the game are apparent to everyone.\n\nFor everything else, thanks, but no thanks.\n\nNot Aligning with Unaligned Owners\n\nAs an outside and passive owner, we at Nalanda want the company owner to align their interest with the shareholders\u2019. We have\n\nonly one objective as a shareholder of any business: long-term value creation. The company must do this in an ethical, sustainable\n\f"}, "001802.png": {"text": "manner that is fair to all stakeholders, including employees, vendors, suppliers, and customers. But as strange as it may sound, not\n\nevery owner has the same objective. There are broadly three categories of owners that we avoid to mitigate our typeI risk.\n\nFirst, government-owned businesses. Unlike the Western world, India has a large number of publicly traded government-\nowned companies. They are almost always cheap, and, for a value investor, they have been unhappy hunting grounds for as long\nas I can remember. I say \u201cunhappy\u201d because most of these cheap businesses almost always stay cheap. Some fund managers may\nhave figured out a way to invest successfully in government-owned businesses, but we will not invest in a government-owned\nenterprise at any price. The government wants to achieve multiple objectives with their businesses, some of which may have noth-\ning to do with enhancing value and profits.\n\nFor example, the Indian state and federal governments regularly resort to farm loan waivers.22 This involves forgiving the\nloans of farmers who have borrowed from government-owned banks. The loan waiver trend started in 1990 (the first waiver was\nfor $1.4 billion) and continues today. Almost every state and federal government has gotten on the bandwagon over the past three\ndecades. This may suit the governments and maybe even the farmers (I say \u201cmaybe\u201d because farmers may not find it easy to bor-\n\nrow the next time they go to the bank). But it may be destructive for the minority shareholder.\n\nIt is not unusual for the Indian government to reward a senior bureaucrat by giving them a senior position at a government-\nowned business. Again, this may suit the bureaucrat but not a shareholder. We have nothing against bureaucrats, but the skill re-\nquired to run a company successfully in a competitive environment is not the same as that needed to manage a district or devise a\nsound social policy for a state. Some businesses, especially the public sector oil companies, occasionally become cash rich, and the\ngovernment then uses them as a piggy bank to manage their fiscal deficit. It suits the government, but how can this be beneficial\nfor a shareholder? It is not that the government objectives are \u201cwrong\u201d\u2014they make sense in the light of the multiple constituen-\n\ncies whose needs they are trying to meet. Their objectives are just different from ours.\n\nThe second category of owners we avoid religiously is the listed subsidiaries of global giants. A few decades ago, the Indian\n\ngovernment forced all Indian subsidiaries of global multinational companies (MNCs) to list in the domestic market. Global MNCs\n\f"}, "001803.png": {"text": "like Cummins, Nestl\u00e9, Procter & Gamble (P&G), Siemens, Unilever, and many others have locally listed subsidiaries. Some are fairly\n\nlarge by Indian standards. For example, the Unilever subsidiary in India, Hindustan Unilever, is valued at about $70 billion.\n\nAt first glance, it may appear that these MNCs should be aligned with the Indian minority shareholder. But there have been\nmany instances when they weren't. A few decades ago, a large global MNC with a listed company in India set up a separate fully\nowned subsidiary. This makes no logical sense because the global giant has only one listing in its home market. For a minority\nshareholder of the listed Indian business, this was a stab in the back because the fully owned subsidiary now does a significant\namount of business. So why would the parent company do this? Isn\u2019t it interested in value creation? Yes, it is. But it is more inter-\nested in the value creation of the parent, not the Indian-listed child. By creating a separate fully owned business, the global MNC\nhas ensured that value accrues to the shareholders in its home market at the cost of the Indian minority shareholder. It gets worse.\nMy friends who have worked for many years in this MNC have told me that its best managers are sent to the privately held busi-\n\nness, not the listed company. What can a minority shareholder do? Absolutely nothing.\n\nNot all MNCs resort to such shenanigans, but enough do. Even if an MNC has behaved well in the past, there is no reason it\nwouldn't change its mind in the future. There is a structural problem with an arrangement in which a parent also has a listed sub-\n\nsidiary. We have better things to do than to participate in this inherent conflict.\n\nLast, we are not fans of the Indian conglomerates. The best known is the Tata Group, which Jamsetji Tata established in\n1868.22 The group had twenty-nine listed businesses with combined revenues of $128 billion and a market value of $311 billion\nas of March 2022. They manufacture steel, gold jewelry, air conditioners, tea, and cars. Oh, and they also own and operate five-star\nluxury hotels from Mumbai to New York. There are many others, like Adani, Aditya Birla, L&T, Mahindra, and RP-Sanjiv Goenka.\nAll typically run a gamut of unrelated businesses across a wide range of industries.\n\nWe believe that value creation is possible only through sustained focus. However, while focus is necessary, it does not guar-\nantee success in a competitive world; most focused businesses aren\u2019t successful. So how does one achieve excellence in multiple\n\nentities across entirely different industries? It\u2019s hard but not impossible.

TCS is the exception that proves the rule.\n\nMaybe the Indian conglomerates will succeed in creating great businesses across their entire portfolios one day. But we are\n\nunwilling to wait for that glorious future.\n\nBut You Would Have Missed Tesla!\n\nYup. We would have.\n\nWe eschew a very long list of risks. This is the core element of our investment strategy. We don\u2019t invest in businesses run by\ncrooks, we detest turnarounds, we stay as far away from leverage as possible, we refuse to engage with M&A addicts, we can\u2019t fig-\nure out fast-changing industries, and we don\u2019t align ourselves with unaligned owners.

Nalanda\u2019s approach has a trade-off that many of you may find unacceptable.\n\nImagine it\u2019s late 2017, and you are impressed with all the media coverage of Tesla. The product seems like a winner based\non its vast fan following. The CEO looks as impressive as the car he makes. But in 2017, Tesla had a net debt of about $7 billion and\nhad suffered an operating loss of $1.6 billion. The company was also burning cash very fast\u2014it had consumed $4.1 billion during\nthe year. The traditional car businesses like BMW, Ford, GM, and Toyota had not yet entered the electric vehicle fray, but they had\nannounced big plans. We abhor debt in general, but debt in a loss-making company with negative free cash flow in a fast-changing\n\nindustry? One can get fired at Nalanda for proposing an investment in a business like this.\n\f"}, "001805.png": {"text": "If you had listened to what we had to say about the business, you would not have invested. Your opportunity loss? Ten times\n\nyour money over the next three years.\n\nWhen we started Nalanda in 2007, there was a lot of buzz around a company called Eicher Motors led by a young, dynamic\nguy called Siddhartha Lal. Lal had inherited a hodgepodge of poor-quality businesses from his father in 2004. They manufactured\nmotorcycles, footwear, garments, tractors, trucks, auto components, and a few other products, and none was an industry leader. In\naremarkably bold strategic move, Lal decided to divest thirteen of the fifteen businesses to focus on just two products: trucks and\n\nmotorcycles.22\n\nAlmost every analyst was gung ho about the future of Eicher; they were all taken in by its dynamic leader who was aggres-\nsively culling businesses, something that Indian firms rarely did. However, in 2007, this was a turnaround story with no empirical\n\nevidence of success. The company\u2019s biggest hit, the Enfield Classic motorcycle, was launched only in 2010.\nWe decided not to invest in the business. By the 2010s, the company\u2019s motorcycles had taken on cult status in the Indian\nconsumer\u2019s mind. Sales exploded from just 52,000 units in 2009 to 822,000 units in 2019: a sixteen-fold growth.\n\nIf you had listened to what we had to say about the business, you would not have invested. Your opportunity loss? Seventy\n\ntimes your money from 2007 until 2021.\n\nTesla and Eicher Motors are the kinds of type II error we will inevitably commit because we reject highly indebted busi-\nnesses, rapidly evolving industry landscapes, and turnarounds. But we will not change our approach. For every Tesla and Eicher,\nhundreds of unproven business models and turnaround stories are unceremoniously consigned to the dustbin of history. We\nbelieve our success is contingent upon our being comfortable with missing out on Teslas and Eichers because on average, avoiding\n\ntype I errors works wonders over the long term.

Did any mention that they don\u2019t care for the customer, that\nthey have stopped innovating, or that they hire people who have been rejected by other companies? Have you ever heard a com-\npany leader disparage their products or services or admit that their competition is doing a better job or that they are sick and tired\nof company politics? You will rarely\u2014if ever\u2014learn anything insightful from what the management says. They always say what\nthey have been taught to say, which at best is useless and at worst is harmful, because, as with Enron, their words are persuasive.\nIn my experience, when someone says, \u201cThis is a great management team,\u201d what they are actually saying is, \u201cThese guys talk so\n\nwell!\u201d The \u201cgreat management team\u201d filter thus fails the first criterion of measurability (being easily measurable).\n\nI know that many professional investors will disagree with me. Many people in the fund management world pride them-\n\nselves on their purported ability to separate the wheat from the chaff after a series of management meetings. Some of them may\n\f"}, "001815.png": {"text": "have this rare skill, but most are either deluded or lying. And if there is someone out there who can assess a company\u2019s quality by\n\nmeeting management, we can applaud them from the sidelines without falling into the trap ourselves.\n\nWhat about other guesses for choosing a single company trait that could point to its overall quality? Could it be revenue\ngrowth? Markets seem to love companies growing at a fast pace. The problem with a revenue growth measure is this: How do we\n\nknow what went into achieving this growth?\n\nIn the previous chapter, I discussed the dot-com bust in the context of fast-changing industries. This period is also relevant\nwhen assessing high-growth businesses. In the late 1990s, most internet businesses were growing fast, but they were achieving\nthis gravity-defying feat by spending millions of dollars of cash far in excess of their revenues. Predictably and unfortunately,\ngrowth did not turn out to be the blessing investors had hoped it would be. They ignored the cost of growth and suffered for it. Al-\nmost all the dot-coms went belly-up eventually.4 By the end of 2005, the loss of market value of these newfangled businesses was\n\nalmost $2 trillion.\n\nMore recently, the spectacular failure of WeWork provides a lesson in funding hyper-growth by burning cash.5 As many of\nyou may already know, Softbank-funded WeWork became one of the largest coworking-space companies on the planet and was\nonce valued at $47 billion. In late 2021, its market value had fallen to about $5 billion. The company grew its revenues from $415\nmillion in 2016 to $3.5 billion in 2019, an eight-fold jump over just three years. Also in 2019, IWG, the old-world coworking giant,\nhad revenue of $2.7 billion, a growth of \u201conly\u201d 28 percent since 2016. WeWork was consuming cash as if it had a side business\nrunning a printing press for dollars; in the third quarter of 2019 alone, the company declared a loss of $1.25 billion. It had to pull\nits IPO in the fourth quarter.\n\nMany high-growth companies don\u2019t burn equity for growth but rely on debt instead, which is even worse because debt hold-\ners need their money back with great regularity, unlike equity investors. Do you remember the fast-growing Lehman Brothers and\nBear Stearns? Lehman grew its revenue by 36 percent annually from $17 billion in 2003 to $59 billion in 2007. This incremental\n\nrevenue of about $40 billion was funded by an incremental debt of almost $90 billion. Similarly, Bear Stearns grew its revenue\n\f"}, "001816.png": {"text": "seven-fold from 2003 to 2007.2 Its incremental revenue of $3.5 billion during this period was primarily funded by an additional\ndebt of $42 billion. When the financial crisis hit in 2008, these highly leveraged entities\u2014which had contributed to the problen\u2014\nhad nowhere to hide. They both collapsed that year.\n\nIalso have a personal reason for not wanting revenue growth to be the primary selection criterion. In my experience, high-\ngrowth businesses can hide myriad problems, ranging from issues of product or service quality, employee culture, and accounting\ntoa bloated balance sheet. According to a study conducted by the Kauffman Foundation and Inc. Magazine, five to eight years after\nthe magazine had identified five thousand businesses as \u201cfastest-growing,\u201d two-thirds of those had shut down, downsized, or been\nsold disadvantageously. I hope you will agree that while \u201chigh growth\u201d is easy to measure, it stumbles on our second filtering cri-\n\nterion (removing most, if not all, low-quality businesses).\n\nI know, I know. You will counter me with just one word: Apple. This fantastic business grew its revenue thirty-three-fold\n\nfrom 2004 to 2020 at an annualized growth of 25 percent. But for every Apple, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of lemons.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s recap. We want to use a single filter, F, to select businesses for further analysis. This should hopefully save us a lot\nof time and effort. We wondered if we could use \u201cquality management teams\u201d or \u201cfast growth\u201d as our starting point. We rejected\n\nboth as good candidates for F because it is tough to assess the former, and the latter can end up causing heartburn.\n\nA third guess for a criterion for short-listing businesses for further analysis could be margins. Is a high-margin business\na high-quality business? Many seem to think so. Margins can mean many things: gross margin (sales minus cost of goods sold\ndivided by sales), EBITDA margin (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization divided by sales), or EBIT margin\n\n(earnings before interest and tax divided by sales). Which of these, if any, should we choose for F?\n\nLet\u2019s start with gross margin, which measures the direct cost of producing the product or service being sold; accountants call\nthis the \u201ccost of goods sold.\u201d If a bar of bath soap retails for $1 and costs 30 cents to make, then the gross margin is 70 percent. Does\na high gross margin tell us anything about the quality of the business? Not really. Several internet businesses boasted a gross mar-\n\ngin of more than 90 percent in the dot-com era, but almost all experienced huge losses because of their marketing spends.\n\f"}, "001817.png": {"text": "What about EBITDA margin or EBIT margin (also called operating margin)? Measuring EBIT margin would be more sensible\nbecause it accounts for depreciation, which is a real cost of doing business. But just because it is a better measure does not mean it\nis a good measure.\n\nTake this example of two real-world businesses: Business C has had an operating margin of about 3 percent over the past\nfifteen years. Business T has delivered an operating margin of 19 percent over the same period. Would you reject Business C and\nselect Business T because T is \u201cbetter\u201d than C? If you did so, you would have spurned Costco, one of America\u2019s best-run businesses.\nBusiness T is Tiffany & Co., a reasonably well-run business but not as well run as Costco. What makes Costco at a margin of 3 per-\ncent a better company than Tiffany at 19 percent?2 I will get to that shortly. Suffice it to say that using margins as a starting point\nto narrow our list of companies may lead us astray. It fails our second and third criteria (removing most, if not all, low-quality\nbusinesses and selecting high-quality businesses).\n\nWe haven't yet considered macro factors for building the short list. But which single piece of macro data should we consider\nfor short-listing individual businesses? For example, if \u201cexperts\u201d believe that inflation will rise, should we short-list only con-\nsumer goods businesses able to pass on the increased cost to their customers? If we do so, should we then completely revise the list\nif the inflation expectations get reversed within six months? I don\u2019t know how to account for macro factors for short-listing high-\nquality businesses. I am not suggesting that it is the wrong thing to do\u2014just that I don\u2019t know how it can be done. And so, we avoid\nconsidering any macro factor as our preliminary filter F. What about accounting for macro factors when making our final list?\n\nMore on that later.\n\nThe Evolutionary Cascade of a Single Selection Criterion\n\nMeanwhile, we seem to be stuck. What could F be? Maybe Lyudmila and her tail-wagging Ember can help us.\n\f"}, "001818.png": {"text": "But before we seek guidance from them, let\u2019s briefly visit the Russia of the 1920s and\u201930s. The brutal Communist regime\nunder Joseph Stalin was forcing individual farmers to give up their land and consolidate their holdings under kolkhozy, or col-\nlective farms.12 The central planners of the Communist Party had envisaged a dramatic increase in agriculture production and\nproductivity arising from scale economies and improved control of output by the State. They expected to be able to feed the rising\n\nurban population and increase exports. The opposite happened.\n\nThe farmers strongly resisted giving up their ancestral land and property; in fact, many chose to destroy their crops and\nslaughter their animals instead of giving in to collectivization. Stalin sent millions of people to prison camps, and millions more\n\ndied of starvation as famine set in owing to the reduction in agriculture production.\n\nIn the middle of this disaster, Trofim Lysenko, an agriculture scientist, claimed that he had invented a new technique to\nsignificantly increase agriculture production. This \u201cnew\u201d technique envisaged that a plant\u2019s acquired characteristics could be in-\nherited. This was in stark contrast to Mendelian genetics and Darwinism, which had demonstrated\u2014by this time, experimentally\n\u2014that genes were the unit of inheritance. Lysenko, however, promised an agricultural revolution with his unscientific techniques\n\nand got the attention of Stalin, who desperately needed a Russian hero to solve his food crisis.\n\nOver time, as Lysenko became more powerful, he declared genetics a pseudoscience, and practicing geneticists were either\nexecuted or sent to labor camps. In this environment, the authorities fired the leading geneticist Dmitri Belyaev from his job at the\nDepartment of Fur Animal Breeding at the Central Research Laboratory. Belyaev\u2019s elder brother, who was studying the genetics of\n\nsilkworms, was executed at Lysenko\u2019s behest in 1937.\n\nDmitri, however, kept studying genetics in secret. In 1959, with Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s ascension to power, he became the\ndirector of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Novosibirsk, Siberia. Dmitri held this post\nfor twenty-six years, until his death in 1985. And during this time, he conducted one of the most remarkable, longest-running ex-\n\nperiments in the history of biology.1! The investigation continues today.\n\f"}, "001819.png": {"text": "Dmitri Belyaev wanted to answer two questions: (1) How had the domestication of animals (e.g., dogs, pigs, goats, and cows)\nstarted, and (2) Why did most domestic animals have similar characteristics, including floppy ears, curly tails, a piebald coloration\n(patches of black and white), and babyish faces? He believed that the domestication of animals resulted from underlying heritable\n\ngenetic changes that had occurred during the course of selection over millennia.\n\nThe big unanswered question was, What was being selected? Natural and artificial selection can occur only if something is\nselected for generation after generation. For example, whereas both cheetahs and lions are ferocious predators, among many other\nfactors, cheetahs have been selected for speed and lions for their size and strength. In other words, a slow cheetah is unlikely to\n\nleave any offspring, but a big, strong lion is likely to leave many.\n\nDmitri hypothesized that the key factor selected when our ancestors domesticated wild animals was tameness. Thus, the\nunit of selection was not related to an animal\u2019s physical attributes but to its behavior. This was an audacious guess since most\nscientists then assumed that physical morphology was the unit of selection. How could Dmitri test his bold theory? Only by going\nback to the time when animals first started becoming domesticated. For dogs, this would have meant experimenting on wild\nwolves. But getting a supply of wolves would have been very hard in Siberia, so he chose the silver fox. He designed a selective\n\nbreeding experiment that focused only on tameness as the selection factor.\n\nAs described earlier, he recruited Lyudmila Trut, an undergraduate student at the prestigious Moscow University, to lead\nand manage the experiment in Siberia. Lyudmila would forever change the field of behavioral genetics with her tenacity and\ncreativity.12\n\nLyudmila\u2019s first task was to select a location for breeding the foxes. She chose a large commercial farm (that sold fox fur)\ncalled Lesnoi, more than 350 kilometers from Novosibirsk, where she and her family lived. She began the experiment in the fall of\n1960 with about a dozen foxes. She also hired several women from nearby villages to be caretakers and experimenters. Here is how\n\nit worked.\n\f"}, "001820.png": {"text": "The experimenters gave the foxes a series of tests from the time they were one month old to their sexual maturity at six to\nseven months. When a fox pup was one month old, the experimenter extended her hand to offer it food while trying to stroke it.\nShe tested the fox pup twice: once in the cage and once while the pup was roaming freely with other pups in a larger enclosure. She\nrepeated this test monthly until the pup reached sexual maturity. To ensure that the pup\u2019s reaction to these tests was based solely\non genetic selection, the pups were not trained and did not have any human contact except for their brief interactions with the\nexperimenters. The pups were caged with their mothers until they were about two months old and then with their litter mates. At\n\nabout three months of age, they were put into their own cages.\n\nWhen the pups were about seven months old, the experimenters assigned them to one of three categories based on their\ntameness. Class III foxes were unfriendly toward the handlers and either ran away from them or were aggressive. Class II foxes\nbehaved neutrally and displayed no emotional response toward the handlers. Class I foxes were the friendliest and seemed to want\nto engage with the handlers.\n\nLyudmila and her team selected a few of the calmest Class I foxes for mating and repeated the experiment with the next\ngeneration of pups. By the third generation in 1962, Lyudmila noticed that some of the tamer foxes had started mating a few days\nearlier than usual and were producing slightly larger litters than wild foxes. Otherwise, there was no indication of any significant\nchange.\n\nIn April 1963, as Lyudmila approached the cages of the fourth generation of pups, she saw a male pup called Ember vigor-\nously wagging his tail. This was precisely what a puppy would do. But no one had ever witnessed a silver fox\u2014whether in a cage\nor the wild\u2014wag its tail at a human. Ember wagged his tail at other humans, too. No other pup of his generation did so, but even a\nsingle fox radically altering its behavior to mimic a dog was significant news. Dmitri had told Lyudmila in their first meeting that\n\nhe wanted to make a dog out of a fox. Had the process begun?\n\nIn 1966, many of the sixth-generation pups that Ember had sired started wagging their tails at the handlers. Ember had not\n\nbeen an anomaly\u2014he was a trailblazer. Lyudmila had categorically demonstrated that tail wagging was genetically heritable. By\n\f"}, "001821.png": {"text": "this time, the researchers had to add another class of foxes called Class IE: the elites. These foxes were extremely friendly, were\neager to establish human contact, and, like dogs, whimpered to attract attention. In the sixth generation, about 1.8 percent of the\npups were elites. By the twentieth generation, almost 35 percent had reached elite status. After about thirty-five generations, more\n\nthan 70 percent of the population had attained elite status.\n\nThis is a breakneck pace of evolution: In less than forty years, Dmitri and Lyudmila\u2019s experiment had essentially converted\na population of wild foxes who avoided humans into dog-like creatures that could be kept as pets in any of our homes. These foxes\nwere very docile, competed for human attention, and formed deep emotional bonds with their handlers. It had become hard to\ndistinguish their behavior from that of dogs. Lyudmila and her team had erased their wildness almost completely. But don\u2019t raise\n\nyour eyebrows in astonishment just yet. I haven't even told you the most interesting result of the experiment.\n\nThe experimenters noticed that the eighth generation of these tamer foxes also started displaying some novel physical traits.\nThe first change was in coat color: Some of the foxes\u2019 fur had a piebald pattern, which is common among domesticated animals\nlike sheep, dogs, horses, pigs, goats, mice, and guinea pigs. A piebald pattern forms when two colors\u2014typically black and white\u2014\nform irregular patches on the animal\u2019s skin. No wild foxes in the experiment were piebald, but as their tameness increased over the\ngenerations, they started showing this coloration. Further physical traits to appear were floppy ears and rolled tails\u2014again, com-\n\nmon among many domesticated species, especially dogs.\n\nIn 1974, Lyudmila decided to raise the experiment\u2019s stakes by living with the foxes in the same house. To start, she chose a\nfriendly fox called Pushinka. One evening, Lyudmila was sitting on a bench outside her home with Pushinka relaxing next to her\nas usual. Suddenly, Pushinka got up as if she had heard something and started barking. It turned out to be the night guard, and\nPushinka stopped her aggressive posturing and barking when she realized that the guard posed no imminent danger to Lyudmila.\n\nThis guard-dog-like behavior\u2014rushing to protect a human from a potential threat\u2014had never been observed before by Lyudmila.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the team also started noticing that the skulls and jaws of the domesticated foxes had started diverging\n\nfrom those of their wild brethren. The cranial height and width of the domesticated foxes\u2019 skulls had shortened. Their snouts had\n\f"}, "001822.png": {"text": "become shorter and wider giving them a baby-like appearance\u2014almost exactly mimicking the differences between a dog anda\n\nwolf.\n\nLet\u2019s consider this for a moment. Remember, Dmitri and his team were selecting for only one trait: the willingness of foxes\nto be tamed. They weren\u2019t interested in body size, coat color, skull shape, ear stiffness, or anything else. The experimenters took\ngreat care to ensure selection based only on tameness. But this single filter of a behavioral characteristic had triggered many physi-\n\ncal changes in the animals. How could this have happened?\n\nThere were no new mutations in the domesticated silver foxes, but their gene expression had changed owing to the selection\nfor tameness. This is how a gene does not change but alters what it expresses: It produces more or fewer chemicals like proteins\nor hormones. For example, when a dog owner stares lovingly into their canine\u2019s eyes, oxytocin is released in the systems of both\nthe dog and the owner, creating a positive feedback loop in which the two enjoy each other\u2019s company more and more. If the same\nowner encounters an unknown dog on the street, no oxytocin is released. Although it\u2019s the same gene in question, the gene expres-\nsion is different in different situations. Scientists have demonstrated that gene expression needs to change only a little to havea\n\nsignificant impact on an animal\u2019s body and behavior.\n\nAs Lyudmila and her team selected tamer foxes, they unknowingly impacted the expression of a select set of genes. This\nselection altered the amount and timing of release of certain neurochemicals and hormones that regulated the developmental and\nphysical traits of the foxes. For example, the hormone melatonin is known to manipulate the timing of mating in many species.\nThe researchers found that the elite females released a lot more melatonin than their Class II and III peers and were ready for mat-\ning a few days earlier than normal. The hormonal change was so extreme that some females were ready to mate twice a year, a phe-\nnomenon never seen in the wild. Selecting for tameness had impacted the reproductive cycle of the species! A gene called HTR2C\nproduced much higher levels of serotonin and dopamine in the elites than in wild foxes. Serotonin is a key hormone in shaping the\n\nearly development of an animal and its increase is likely to have changed the physiology and behavior of the domesticated foxes.\n\f"}, "001823.png": {"text": "The researchers also discovered that the tamed foxes had much lower levels of adrenaline than their wild cousins. Adrenaline reg-\n\nulates the production of melanin, which determines the coloration of skin and fur.\n\nThe silver fox experiment also solved the centuries-old puzzle of the numerous physical similarities among domesticated\nanimals discussed earlier. Dmitri had rightly hypothesized that since mammals share similar hormonal and neurotransmitter\n\nregulatory systems, selecting for tameness would unleash broadly similar developmental and physical changes in them as well.\n\nDmitri and Lyudmila\u2019s experiment, now running for more than sixty years, has demonstrated that evolution does not occur\npiecemeal. The behavior and physiology of animals are intimately connected. Darwin, with his acute powers of observation, knew\nthis. His statement at the beginning of this chapter asserts that hairless dogs have imperfect teeth and pigeons with feathered feet\nhave skin between their outer toes. He predicted that if humans choose to select for one characteristic, they will surely also cause\n\ntransformations in other characteristics owing to what he called the \u201cmysterious laws of the correlation of growth.\u201d\n\nDmitri and Lyudmila had proven Darwin right.\n\nSelect One, Get Many Free\n\nAs an investor, would you not want to be in the position of selecting just one trait of a business but getting many high-quality\nattributes for \u201cfree\u201d? As discussed earlier, this single trait should satisfy three criteria: it should be measurable, reject most busi-\nnesses of poor quality, and select most high-quality businesses. Most, not necessarily all. We have seen that some factors like high-\n\nquality management, revenue growth, and margins do not serve the purpose well enough.\n\nAt Nalanda, here is what we begin with while short-listing businesses: historical return on capital employed (ROCE).\n\f"}, "001824.png": {"text": "The first word first. Historical. I devote an entire chapter to this important and oft-ignored word, but for now I wanted to\nclarify that the ROCE number is what a business has delivered in the past. We don\u2019t listen to stories about how ROCE will improve\nin the future. We want to assess a company purely on its historically delivered ROCE.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at some definitions. ROCE is simply the operating profit of the business as a percentage of total capital em-\nployed. As defined earlier, operating profit is earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT. Why do we not use profit after tax (PAT)\ninstead? Remember, we want to understand a business's operating performance, and mixing it with financial measures like tax and\ninterest will muddy the waters. We do not ignore tax or interest charges in our overall evaluation of the business, but for calculat-\ning ROCE, we limit ourselves to operating performance.\n\nWhat about total capital employed? This typically comprises two factors: net working capital and net fixed assets. In the\nnet working capital number, we like to exclude excess cash (i.e., cash minus debt if cash happens to be much greater than debt)\nbecause extra cash is not an operating asset. Also, high-ROCE companies generate a lot of cash, and incorporating cash into the\ncapital employed number will unnecessarily reduce ROCE. If you are uncomfortable with this, you can include a portion of cash\nin capital employed. For an acquisitive company, we also include the capital invested in acquiring businesses, but let\u2019s keep things\nsimple for the moment. Thus, ROCE for nonfinancial companies can be defined as follows:\n\nEBIT = (net working capital + net fixed assets)\n\nDo you now see why using operating margin to filter businesses may not be the best approach? Margins do not tell us what\nwe had to invest to get those margins. The advantage of measuring ROCE is that it accounts for the quality of P&L (in the numera-\ntor) as well as the balance sheet (in the denominator). Let\u2019s return to Costco and Tiffany.\n\nI claimed that Costco at an operating margin of 3 percent is a better business than Tiffany at 19 percent. If we limit our defi-\nnition of \u201cbetter\u201d to the level of ROCE, then I was right. This is because Costco\u2019s average ROCE from 2014 to 2019 (pre-pandemic)\nwas 22 percent compared to Tiffany\u2019s 16 percent. Costco is deploying its capital much more effectively than Tiffany, and this more\n\nthan compensates for Costco\u2019s low margin. Let\u2019s take the example of just one important part of its capital employed: inventory.\n\f"}, "001825.png": {"text": "Costco keeps about 31 days of inventory in its warehouses and retail stores. Guess the same number for Tiffany. It is 521 days, or\nalmost a year and half! Tiffany\u2019s operating margin is impressive, but Costco\u2019s dramatically better management of its inventory and\n\nother assets ensures it earns a higher ROCE than Tiffany.\n\nMany investors prefer return on equity (ROE). I don\u2019t. ROE is calculated after taxes and interest payments, and hence mixes\noperating performance with financing strategy and tax structure. As a business owner, Iam much more concerned with the su-\nperior operating performance of a business. While taking on leverage (which will improve ROE but not ROCE) and \u201cplanning\u201d for\ntaxes may benefit a firm in the short to medium term, in my experience, success over the long term comes only by running great\n\noperations. Which brings us back to ROCE.\n\nWhat does a high ROCE of, say, 20 percent tell us? A simple fact: This business earns $20 for every $100 it invests. This is\nequivalent to making a bank deposit of $100 and earning $20 on it after a year. No, you are not ina hyper-inflationary Latin Ameri-\ncan economy but in the \u201cnormal\u201d world. I assume you would be on the moon if you owned a high-ROCE business like that. They are\n\nrare, but they do exist, and when you find them, they will tell you a lot.\n\nHigh ROCE is a lot like tameness in the Siberian silver foxes. Just as tameness brings with it a curly tail, piebald fur, and\n\nfloppy ears, a high-ROCE business ushers in many attributes relevant for an owner like us at Nalanda. Here are some examples.\n\nA Consistently High-ROCE Business Is Likely to Be Run by an Excellent Management Team\n\nWhat? \u201cExcellent management team\u201d again? If we can\u2019t measure it directly, why am I sneaking it in indirectly?\n\nJust because we can\u2019t measure management quality through interviews and discussions does not mean quality manage-\nment teams do not exist. Of course they do. What we need is not some airy-fairy impression of an investor made over a coffee (or\na Zoom call) but a quantitative measure. We don\u2019t vote for the best cricket bowler, best running back, or best marathoner based\n\non their interviews or their ability to articulate their excellence, so why should we do it for management teams? The best bowling\n\f"}, "001826.png": {"text": "statistics and the best finish times determine the best bowler and the best marathoner. Similarly, in my view, an excellent\u2014but not\n\nthe only\u2014indicator of the quality of the management team is their historical track record on the quantity of ROCE.\n\nSustaining high ROCE in any industry over any length of time is extraordinarily hard. Microeconomic theory states that\nexcess returns should be driven to zero in competitive markets, which means that businesses need to run very hard simply to earn\ntheir cost of capital. This may be true for most businesses, but there are a select set of companies that defy logic and competition to\nearn high returns on capital year on year, decade after decade.\n\nThe median historical ROCE of our portfolio of thirty businesses\u2014most of which are more than thirty-five to forty years old\n\u2014is about 42 percent. I am obviously biased since I am an investor in these businesses, but I do think the management teams of\nthese businesses are excellent. Are they exemplary, or am I just calling them first rate because they happen to have high ROCE? I\ndon\u2019t know. Does it matter?\n\nWe should expect the following from a quality management team. That they deliver products and services to their cus-\ntomers that are superior to those of their competitors, allocate capital prudently, attract and retain quality employees, manage\ntheir cost structure (which is commensurate with their size and revenue), maintain a quality balance sheet, and continuously in-\n\nnovate by taking calculated risks.

But how does one go about assessing whether a company has an SCA?

Berkshire invested almost $600 million in Coke in 1988 and nearly the same amount in Gillette in 1989. By 1993,\nthe combined value of these two shareholdings for Berkshire was $5.6 billion, which was equal to all other holdings combined,\nand Buffett was sitting on a gain of about $4 billion in these businesses. His commentary on Coke and Gillette in his 1993 annual\nletter is as follows: \u201cThe might of their brand names, the attributes of their products, and the strength of their distribution sys-\n\ntems give them an enormous competitive advantage, setting up a protective moat around their economic castles.\u201d\n\nBuffett, as usual, is correct. Almost three decades after this letter, Coke and Gillette continue to be enormous successes and,\ngiven their increasing market share, continue to have a solid competitive advantage. But did Buffett conclude that they hada\nstrong competitive advantage because they had strong brands and product attributes, or was his claim based on the empirical fact\nthat these businesses had high ROCE and an increasing market share over a long period? We will never know of course. My guess\n(contention?) is that it was the latter.\n\nThe reality is that most brands don\u2019t have any\u2014forget about \u201csustainable\u201d\u2014competitive advantage. Depending on which\nsource you believe, across tens of thousands of brand launches annually in the United States, the failure rate is 80 to 90 percent.1\u00a2\nIt\u2019s not as bad as buying a lottery ticket, but it\u2019s also not that far off. You may also think that failure is limited to small and untested\nbusinesses and that the likes of Coke and Pepsi do very well. You would be wrong. Here is just a small sample of spectacular brand\nfailures from large companies: New Coke (Coca-Cola), Crystal Pepsi (Pepsi), Premier smokeless cigarettes (R. J. Reynolds), Maxwell\nHouse ready-to-drink coffee (General Mills), Souper Combo (a combined soup-and-sandwich meal from Campbell), and All Natural\nCleaning Vinegar (Heinz).\n\nJust having a brand means nothing. If something as simple to understand as a \u201cbrand\u201d does not necessarily confer a compet-\n\nitive advantage (and even if it does, it is probably very tough to definitively say so), how do we know if a company has a competitive\n\f"}, "001828.png": {"text": "advantage? No prizes for guessing. Yes, a sustained high ROCE is a good starting point to conclude that the company may have\nsome kind of competitive advantage. And if it is a consumer company like Coca-Cola, maybe it is the brand, maybe the distribution,\n\nmaybe the management, and maybe some combination of these and other factors.\n\nOnce we have short-listed a company based on its sustained high ROCE, we start analyzing its competitive advantages. After\nweeks or months of research, we may conclude that this high ROCE is unsustainable and that the company just got lucky histor-\nically. So be it. We then choose to stay away. But taking this route\u2014of starting our assessment of competitive advantage only for\n\nhigh-ROCE companies\u2014saves us a lot of time and effort.\n\nA Consistently High-ROCE Business Allocates Capital Well\n\nAs a (very) long-term investor, when we choose to buy shares of a business, we allocate our capital to that business. We are doing\nso hoping that we will earn a decent return on this capital over the long run. Hopefully, we have evaluated other options for our\ncapital and have made the correct decision that it is best invested in this business. Investors who allocate capital well perform well.\n\nThose who don\u2019t don\u2019t.\n\nBusinesses are no different. They, too, allocate capital on an ongoing basis. They have many options, and they try to choose\nthe best one. They, too, hope to earn a decent return on their investment. Some do; most don\u2019t. ROCE is an excellent measure of\nacompany\u2019s ability to deploy capital. High ROCE implies that these businesses earn high operating profit relative to their capital\ndeployed. Great businesses try neither to maximize operating profit nor minimize capital deployed; they try to earn the maximum\n\noperating profit per unit of capital deployed.\n\nInvestors may not realize it, but strategy and most capital allocation decisions are deeply intertwined. For instance, is\nsetting up a manufacturing plant in Milwaukee versus outsourcing to China a strategic or a capital allocation decision? It doesn\u2019t\n\nmatter; it is a decision that will significantly influence the company\u2019s success. And so, it is both.\n\f"}, "001829.png": {"text": "Some more examples of strategic decisions that allocate capital in radically different ways are as follows: setting up one\u2019s\nown R&D division versus copying the best designs from the market, hiring a chief technology officer to build one\u2019s technology\nunit versus outsourcing it, building a manufacturing unit for critical parts versus funding a supplier, hiring young graduates and\ntraining them over many years versus hiring qualified professionals laterally, making an acquisition to enter new geography ver-\nsus growing organically, funding a loss-making product in a large addressable market versus investing in profitable products ina\nsmall market, and advertising for many months on social media versus buying a single Super Bowl ad.\n\nHow does an investor know if these myriad capital allocation decisions are sensible? One way is to analyze them thoroughly.\nFor example, one could interview the marketing head to understand why they bought the Super Bowl ad instead of spreading the\nsame expense over many weeks or months of advertising on Google or Facebook. One could then build financial models to test the\ncompany\u2019s likelihood of success, compare its advertising strategy to other companies, and then reach a conclusion that either sup-\nports or contradicts its decision.\n\nThe second way\u2014our way\u2014is to select companies with high ROCE as the first filter. We assume that a company with high\nROCE is, on average, deploying its capital well. It may make some poor decisions, but overall, we believe its capital allocation and\nstrategic decisions are quite sound.\n\nAlso, frankly, it\u2019s just easier this way. If I were to try to build multi-megabyte spreadsheets to test various scenarios of a\nparticular capital decision, I would fail miserably. Twice. Once in making the spreadsheet and again in reaching an erroneous\n\nconclusion.\n\nSo why try?\n\nA Consistently High-ROCE Business Allows Companies to Take Business Risk Without Taking Financial Risk, Which In-\n\ncreases the Chance of Business Success\n\f"}, "001830.png": {"text": "Capitalism thrives on risk-taking. And risk-taking is not limited just to teenagers starting companies in their garages in Silicon\nValley. All companies, if they want to grow and succeed, need to keep taking calculated risks. Those that don\u2019t take risks either\natrophy or remain small and irrelevant; those that venture to take bigger risks than warranted implode. It is in the Goldilocks zone\nof calculated risk-taking that most companies thrive. High ROCE allows a company to keep taking calculated business risks. This is\n\nhow.\n\nAcompany delivering high ROCE with modest revenue growth will generate excess cash. This is not an opinion\u2014just a\nmathematical fact. For example, Company X growing its sales at 10 percent with ROCE of 25 percent can grow from zero cash toa\ncash balance of almost 18 percent of sales in five years (other assumptions: margin 15 percent, tax 30 percent). With an increasing\ncash cushion, X\u2019s management team can choose to launch new products or target new geography. Even if the new business fails, X\n\ncan recover given its ability to generate cash from its core business.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at its competitor, Y, which is growing at the same rate (10 percent) with the same margin (15 percent) but\nwith a lower ROCE of 12 percent. In five years, Y would have a negative cash balance of 3 percent of revenue. In other words, Y\nwould have to borrow to grow at the same rate as X. With a weaker balance sheet and a lack of spare cash, Y would be forced to\neither forgo new opportunities or borrow more money to launch a new product or venture in new geography. If the venture fails,\nY could be in deep trouble because its core business is not generating enough cash to repay the loan and interest when due. This\nwould further widen the gap between companies X and Y. Over time, X would grow larger and more successful, and Y would be just\na shadow of X. We see this phenomenon play out across many industries in which a few players have tended to become more dom-\ninant given their ability to generate cash on account of high ROCE.\n\nWhat happens if a company with high ROCE stumbles? Let me share the example of Havells, a Nalanda portfolio company\nsince 2011. Havells is India\u2019s largest consumer electrical equipment business and sells fans, lights and lighting fixtures, circuit\n\nbreakers, wire, water heaters, and kitchen appliances like blenders and toasters.15\n\f"}, "001831.png": {"text": "Havells delivered 52 percent ROCE (!) from 2007 to 2017 under its exceptional leader, Anil Gupta. Its annualized revenue\ngrowth was about 15 percent during this period, and Havells was sitting on a cash balance of $230 million in March 2017. This\nwas about 28 percent of revenue that year. In May 2017, Havells acquired the consumer business of Lloyd Electric, primarily for\n\nLloyd\u2019s fast-growing air conditioner business.\n\nWe were not too thrilled with this acquisition. While the company was clearly not taking a financial risk with the acquisi-\n\ntion, since its cash balance was larger than the acquisition price, it was taking a risk that was outside our comfort zone.\n\nThe biggest issue, we thought, was the difference in culture and company mindset. Havells sells high-quality products at\na premium to the discerning Indian consumer. It does so by setting up high-tech manufacturing plants, customizing product\nfeatures to the needs of the consumer, staying ahead of the technology curve, and creating brand pull by advertising on TV and the\ninternet. Lloyd seemed to be the exact opposite of Havells in many ways: It had gained market share over the past decade by ag-\ngressively pushing low-priced air conditioners imported from China. While Havells \u201cpulled\u201d consumers, Lloyd \u201cpushed\u201d its prod-\nucts by offering large dealer incentives and product discounts. Lloyd seemed singularly focused on growth at any price, whereas\n\nHavells\u2019 growth was an outcome of delivering quality products and building the trust of dealers and consumers over six decades.\n\nPrior to Lloyd, one of the main sources of Havells\u2019 success was its ability to launch new products through its existing sales\nchannel. The company has built a loyal and high-performing dealership network over many decades. This symbiotic relationship\nhas allowed Havells to manufacture and sell an extensive range of consumer durables from fans to circuit breakers to toasters.\nHowever, for the first time, with the Lloyd acquisition, Havells was unable to use the strength of its dealer network because the air\n\nconditioner sales channel was completely different from the consumer electricals channel in India.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the company immediately began facing problems with the acquisition. It started with the resignation of\nthe CEO of Lloyd and many senior managers within a few months of the change in ownership. Havells found that Lloyd was sell-\ning its products through only a few dealers who had grown quite powerful over the years. These dealers were demanding higher\n\nmargins and a greater share of Lloyd\u2019s business. When Havells refused, many of these dealers left, adversely impacting the sales\n\f"}, "001832.png": {"text": "and profitability of the business. There was also some level of dissonance while the Havells management tried to reconcile two\nradically different brand positioning approaches: the premium positioning of Havells versus the aggressive price warrior stance of\n\nLloyd. Within two years of the acquisition, research analysts downgraded Havells as Lloyd\u2019s numbers continued to disappoint.\n\nAt this stage, Gupta could have taken the easy route of allowing Lloyd to revert to its old business ways. This would have\npreserved revenue and profit momentum and created two different kinds of business under the same umbrella. But he decided to\n\ntake the much tougher road of instituting long-term fundamental changes to Lloyd\u2019s organization and business model.\n\nGupta repositioned the Lloyd brand from being a low-priced, average-quality product that offered only basic features toa\nhigh-quality product whose features matched or exceeded the best in the market. Havells invested about $35 million to set up\nanew state-of-the-art air conditioner plant that is now producing high-end, feature-rich air conditioners. Over many months,\nGupta gradually replaced the senior management of Lloyd with leaders steeped in the Havells culture. The company refused to be\nblackmailed by a few powerful dealers and built a new, more resilient distribution network despite losing sales in the short term.\n\nLloyd is now integrated with Havells, and there is complete alignment with their strategic and organizational priorities.\n\nOne key reason Havells was able to withstand short-term pain to achieve its longer-term goals was the availability of cash\non the balance sheet. And the reason it had accumulated cash was its exceptionally high ROCE over many years. It\u2019s easy for any\ncompany to claim that it is \u201cworking for long-term value creation,\u201d but these words are worthless without the courage provided by\nacash cushion. We will never know what would have happened if Havells had had a lot of debt and interest to repay, but I doubt it\nwould have had the same determination to continue on a challenging, lengthy, and uncertain path with bankers breathing down\nits neck.\n\nHavells made a moderately risky acquisition, took the time and effort to integrate it despite initial hiccups, and converted\nwhat could have been a significant misstep into a strategic success. Anil Gupta rocks. Havells rocks. Because 52 percent ROCE\n\nrocks.\n\f"}, "001833.png": {"text": "There Are No Guarantees in Investing\n\nJust as selecting for tameness in silver foxes helped Dmitri and Lyudmila generate many other traits in the animals, selecting\nfor high ROCE has ensured that we have chosen businesses with many other desirable qualities. After the companies have been\nthrough the risk filter, as I discussed in chapter 1, we reject companies with long-term historical ROCE lower than 20 percent. Our\npreliminary short list of about 150 companies consists only of those that have delivered ROCE of more than 20 percent over the\npast five to ten years or more.\n\nIhave not claimed that we look only at ROCE to arrive at our conclusion on a business. That would border on being reckless\nand foolish. What I have said, though, is that we start the evaluation of a business by studying the record of its delivered historical\nROCE. If you are an investor or choose to be one, you will develop your method and style of investing. But whatever you do, starting\n\nwith a good understanding of the historical ROCE of a business will ensure you are miles ahead of your competition.\nBuy one, get many free.\n\nAs you may have guessed, there are two problems with the approach of choosing ROCE as the first filter. First, a consistently\n\nhigh ROCE in the past does not guarantee that ROCE will be high in the future.\n\nFor example, if a business has a monopoly in its industry, say, of operating local bus services or a copper mine, even a poor-\nquality management team would probably be able to earn a decent return on capital. When the monopoly ends, however, we may\nsee ROCE trend downward. Similarly, if there is high tariff protection for a product or commodity, domestic companies manufac-\nturing the same product or commodity may earn decent profits without breaking a sweat. And then there is luck. A company can\nmake decent ROCE for a few years if its key competitors get in trouble of their own making.\n\nWhile making the preliminary short list, we can easily eliminate these kinds of companies because they are easy to identify.\nHowever, another category of potential losers (with high historical ROCE) is tough to identify beforehand. A high-quality business\n\ncan also lose its way if the founder gets distracted, the company decides to change its strategy, the management bets the company\n\f"}, "001834.png": {"text": "ona failed acquisition, or an aggressive new competitor makes life difficult for the company.

Take Netflix. If we had evaluated Netflix in early 2018, its median ROCE for the previous\nten years (2008 to 2017) of 10 percent would have been too low for us to include it on our preliminary list. We would have missed\nout on a spectacular wealth-creation opportunity: Netflix\u2019s stock price jumped 2.9 times from January 2018 to December 2021.\n\nBut here is the thing. We would have looked at this lost opportunity and not regretted it one bit. I know we will lose Netflix-\nlike businesses, and I am okay with it. Our strategy of selecting only high-ROCE companies for our initial list invariably excludes\nsome potential winners, but it also excludes hundreds of low-quality businesses that we would never want to own. Thus, on aver-\nage, | believe this approach works well for us.\n\n\u2018We will not change our approach just because others have made money with a strategy that we have chosen to avoid.\n\nCest la vie.\n\n2K\n\nIn early 2022, I wrote to the Institute of Cytology and Genetics at Novosibirsk.

Just think about it for a moment: Orchids\nand orangutans share these same four nucleotides in their DNA code; they are just arranged differently in each. Human beings\nhave three billion base pairs of nucleotides. Not in our whole body. In almost every cell of our body. I find this quite astounding. Re-\nmember that the next time you are packing a tight suitcase! And just because we rule the world does not mean we have the largest\ngenome. The size of the human genome is quite unremarkable. The lowly Amoeba dubia, a single-celled organism, has 670 billion\n\nbase pairs in its DNA\u2014that makes for a genome about 220 times larger than yours and mine.2\n\nFor this discussion, let\u2019s focus just on genes that manufacture proteins. We are all essentially a bag of proteins. Proteins\nbuild bodies and regulate, defend, and monitor their functioning. Our body parts differ because they have different proteins. For\ninstance, keratin makes our skin, hemoglobin carries oxygen in our blood, and proteins called immunoglobulins defend us from\n\nparasites.\n\nDNA makes protein in a two-step process: the first being transcription and the second translation. First, a single strand of\nDNA with a long chain of A, C, T, and G nucleotides gets transcribed onto a complementary messenger RNA (ribonucleic acid) se-\nquence called mRNA (yes, this molecule is the basis of the COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). Thus, the\nDNA sequence ACGGATCGA shown in figure 3.1 will get transcribed to the mRNA sequence UGCCUAGCU. What is this new letter,\nU? In the transcription process, the DNA nucleotide A (adenosine) gets transcribed onto the mRNA nucleotide U (uracil), and, as\n\ndescribed earlier, C pairs with G and T with A.\n\nADNA sequence has produced a corresponding mRNA sequence. What now? In the second step, a sequence of mRNA mole-\ncules is translated into a sequence of amino acids that synthesize a protein. mRNA is a single-stranded molecule, and it comprises\n\ncodons made of three nucleotides that code for specific amino acids. In the mRNA sequence UGCCUAGCU shown in figure 3.1, the\n\f"}, "001844.png": {"text": "first codon, UGC, makes the amino acid tyrosine; the second codon, CUA, codes for leucine, and the third codon, GCU, codes for the\n\namino acid alanine. A sequence of amino acids folds into a protein. Voila! DNA made mRNA, which then made a protein.\n\nIf you are a biologist, I hope you haven't had a heart attack\u2014I know that these few lines don\u2019t fully capture the complexities\nand nuances of the working of the universal genetic code. We haven't covered rRNA, tRNA, noncoding DNA, or enzymes. But hey,\nthis is not a biology textbook, and I am simply trying to lay the basic groundwork to make sure we all have the same basic under-\n\nstanding of genetic code before moving ahead.\n\nTo comprehend the robustness of living organisms at multiple levels, let\u2019s start at the bottom: the universal genetic code.\n\nThe Genetic Code Is Robust\n\nAs mentioned, a codon comprising three bases creates an amino acid. Thus, the codon AGC creates the amino acid serine, and\nGGC makes glycine. Since any of the four nucleotides (A, C, U, or G) can occupy one of the three bases, there are sixty-four possible\namino acids (4 x 4 x 4). However, only twenty exist in nature. How so? This is because two or more codons can code for the same\namino acid. For instance, GGU, GGC, GGA, and GGG are all glycine. Thus, any mutation on the third position of the codon with the\nfirst two positions GG will always form glycine. These are called synonymous mutations. The formation of glycine is thus highly\nrobust to mutations on the third base. Overall, the universal genetic code has funneled down sixty-four possibilities to just twenty\nthrough this type of synonymous mutation.\n\nSynonymous mutations are just the first level of robustness. Scientists have found that translation errors\u2014errors at the\npoint of codon formation\u2014are most likely at the third position and least likely at the first position. Amazingly, the degree of\nrobustness is also highest at the third position of the codon,\u2018 as in the earlier example of glycine. Thus, even though the third posi-\ntion is most error prone in translation, it will have no impact on the type of amino acid formed! In other words, evolution has en-\n\nsured that the genetic code is extremely robust to mutations and translation errors. Isn\u2019t that cool?\n\f"}, "001845.png": {"text": "Proteins Are Robust\n\nLet\u2019s now go one level beyond the genetic code to see if proteins are robust to changes in the sequence of amino acids.\n\nAs discussed, a protein is a large molecule made up of a certain amino acid sequence. They are in all living organisms and are\ndirectly involved in all the chemical processes essential for creating and sustaining life. Thus, given the stability of life forms, one\n\nwould expect proteins to show a high degree of robustness, and that is exactly what we see.\n\nThere are three types of protein robustness. First, scientists have found that the function of proteins is unaffected by the\nvast majority of amino acid changes. For example, the bacteria E. coli carries a protein called B-lactamase, which confers antibiotic\nresistance. This protein has 263 amino acids, 84 percent of which can experience mutation (i.e., they can be changed into another\namino acid) without changing the enzyme\u2019s basic function. Ponder that. It would be like making 84 mistakes on a math exam com-\nprising 100 questions and still getting an A!\n\nThe second type of robustness results from proteins with similar functions and structures being able to be made from\ndifferent amino acid sequences. For example, myoglobin and hemoglobin are oxygen-binding proteins in vertebrates, and they\nhave many distant relatives in invertebrates (like crabs and spiders) and plants. The three-dimensional structure of whale myo-\nglobin and clam hemoglobin can be almost perfectly superimposed! Despite this uncanny structural and functional similarity, the\namino acid sequences of the two are very different. Only 18 percent of the amino acids of the whale myoglobin and clam hemoglo-\nbin overlap.\n\nThird, scientists have found that the vast majority of amino acid sequences fold into very few structures. No, I really mean\nit\u2014very few. Let\u2019s see how few. A small protein may have 100 amino acids, and so the number of possible protein folds is 20190,\nwhich is more than the number of atoms in the universe.2 And how many proteins exist? About 10,000 (or 203). Thus, protein\n\nstructure and function are extremely robust.\n\f"}, "001846.png": {"text": "The Body Is Robust\n\nLet\u2019s now go one level up from proteins to the body by taking the example of sea urchins.\n\nSea urchins evolved 250 million years ago and comprise about 1,000 species. For now, we will focus on just two found in\nshallow waters in Australia: Heliocidaris tuberculata and Heliocidaris erythrogramma. Let\u2019s call them species T and E. Their body\n\nplans are conserved; in other words, they look the same but have dramatically different modes of development.\n\nT produces larvae (called pluteus) that bear no physical resemblance to the adult, and these free-swimming pluteus feed on\nplankton as they grow into adulthood. E, on the other hand, develops directly from an egg with no larval stage in between. But T\nand E are quite closely related and diverged only about five million years ago (almost the same time that chimpanzees and humans\ndiverged; it would be as if chimps produced larvae that did not look like adult chimps!). The entire development programs\u2014the\nshape and size of eggs, the location of cell formation for various body parts, the activation of genes that control development\u2014of\nthese two species differ so significantly that it is almost unbelievable that the two species have a common ancestor from only five\nmillion years ago. Despite these massive developmental changes, if you do a Google search for images of T and E, you will notice\n\nthat they look almost the same.\n\nHow have the sea urchins maintained their body plans while changing many fundamental aspects of their development?\nAnd what have they achieved by maintaining highly robust body plans while evolving drastically different routes of development?\n\nWe will get to these questions in a moment, but for now, let me summarize what we have learned.\n\nWe have seen that the stability of living organisms and species is maintained through robustness at multiple levels: at the\nlevels of genetic code, proteins, and even body plan. For the sake of brevity, I have chosen to omit details of robustness at many\nother levels: changes in the secondary structure of RNA, changes in the regulatory regions of a gene, and drastic changes in en-\n\nzyme activity, just to name a few.\n\f"}, "001847.png": {"text": "A mutation changes the DNA sequence of a gene? No problem. It produces the same amino acid. The amino acid sequence\nchanges owing to mutation or recombination? No problem. It produces the same protein. There is a change in the arrangement\nof proteins? No problem. The same enzyme activity continues. And so on. Living things are built to be resilient and resistant to\n\nchange.\n\nThe Evolution of Evolvability\n\nThis gets us to the paradox I mentioned at the start of the chapter. Given multiple levels of robustness, how in the world do species\n\nevolve? Should they not stay fixed? What propelled bacteria to become bonobos?\nThe short and incredible answer is that robustness itself leads to evolvability!\n\nWe need to make a brief foray into one aspect of the history of molecular biology to unravel the paradox. In 1968, the Japa-\nnese geneticist Motoo Kimura proposed the \u201cneutral theory\u201d of molecular evolution.\u2019 Kimura contended that most changes at the\nlevel of DNA and amino acids do not impact the function of a molecule and hence the organism\u2019s ability to survive and reproduce.\nHe contended that a small number of mutations are favorable, and natural selection preserves them. Some mutations are rejected\nbecause they are harmful, but most mutations don\u2019t really affect the organism. According to Kimura, most mutations are neutral,\nwhich causes robustness in the organism.\n\nSo how does neutral mutation lead to evolution? While a neutral change does not alter the primary function, it can alter a\nsecondary function, thereby becoming the source of a future innovation.\n\nLet\u2019s say gene A has primary function F. Owing to a mutation, gene A becomes gene B, but since it\u2019s a robust system, gene B\ncontinues to perform function F. But gene B affects a secondary function, FS. FS does not alter the fitness of the organism but can be\n\nused by the organism\u2019s descendants for a completely new function, thereby leading to evolution. Thus, although the genetic code\n\f"}, "001848.png": {"text": "was robust (because gene A changing into gene B did not affect function F), the addition of function FS allowed the organism to\n\nevolve.\nIna robust biological system, evolvability comes free!\n\nLet\u2019s now return to the sea urchin example. T and E have maintained their body plans\u2019 robustness while changing their\ndevelopment cycle through neutral mutations over millions of years. For example, 16 of the 32 cells of the T embryo become the\nectoderm (the outer layer of skin), whereas 26 of the 32 E embryo cells do so. The sea urchins\u2019 body structures have stayed robust\nto multiple changes in embryonic development. As a result, they have exploited a completely new ecological niche and a novel way\nof life. For example, E is abundant in deep seas and polar latitudes where T cannot survive\u2014this is because E develops directly and\ndoes not need to go through the larval stage critically dependent on plankton for survival.\n\nSomething similar has been happening at McKinsey over the past century. Today's McKinsey bears no resemblance to\nMarvin Bower's McKinsey in terms of geographical presence, organization processes, type of client work, and breadth of expertise.\nBut at some fundamental level of culture, oneness, problem-solving, and working with CXOs, the firm has remained stubbornly\nBoweresque. It has changed without changing. This is what we seek as owners in our businesses: the ability to keep evolving while\n\nstaying robust.\n\nBusinesses Must Be Robust to Evolve\n\nLet\u2019s recap our journey until now. We have eliminated serious risks (chapter 1) and have shortlisted businesses based on ROCE\n\n(chapter 2). Now we need to select companies for their robustness.\n\nHere are some learnings we have internalized at Nalanda.\n\f"}, "001849.png": {"text": "Robustness Takes Many Forms\n\nHow does an investor measure robustness in a business? I wish I had a simple quantitative answer. I don't. Like almost everything\n\nin investing, the solution is somewhat subjective, somewhat vague, and somewhat controversial. But it works for us. The best way\n\nto understand robustness is to contrast the two extremes listed in table 3.1.\n\nTABLE 3.1 Examples of robustness in a business\n\n \n\nMost robust\n\nLeast robust\n\n \n\nHas delivered high historical ROCE over a long period\nHas a fragmented customer base\n\nHas no debt and has excess cash\n\nHas built high competitive barriers\n\nHas a fragmented supplier base\n\nHas a stable management team\n\nIndustry is slow changing\n\nHas made operating losses for most or all of its history\nIs dependent on very few customers\n\nIs highly leveraged\n\nHas been unable to keep competition away\n\nIs dependent on a few suppliers\n\nManagement turnover is high\n\nIndustry is evolving fast\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list, but I hope you will get the general drift of what I mean when I say a business is robust.

Also, almost no business falls entirely within the left or right column in my experience.\n\nRobustness is not a black-and-white measure. Thankfully. Or else, what would separate a good investor from a great one?\n\nDifferent investors attribute different weights to the factors listed in table 3.1. For instance, many investors do not consider\ncustomer concentration to be a problem for a business. We do. We took advantage of these contrasting opinions a few months after\n\nthe inception of Nalanda.\n\nWNS is an Indian business process outsourcing (BPO) company with a U.S. listing. The leading BPO companies like WNS\nprovide many mission-critical services to their clients of a quality and at a price that can typically not be matched by the com-\npany\u2019s internal teams. For example, they help their clients close the books of accounts, manage payables and receivables, perform\ntimely consumer analytics, process mortgage applications, and address customer issues. We had been tracking WNS since we\nstarted Nalanda in 2007. Despite its high ROCE, zero debt, strong competitive advantage, and stable management team, we did not\nlike the business because of its dependence on just a few customers. In 2006, WNS's top five customers accounted for 41 percent of\nrevenue, and in 2007, this number had jumped to 55 percent.2 We worried that the company\u2019s robustness was low and declining.\n\nBut the markets did not seem to care, and WNS'\u2019s stock price reached $35 by the middle of 2007.\n\nWNS lost a major client in the latter half of 2007, and another client threatened to terminate their agreement. This wasn\u2019t\ngreat news in the short term, and the markets punished WNS severely. The stock crashed to $13 in early 2008. However, we con-\ncluded that the company would become more robust with a more fragmented customer base. We bought about 6 percent of the\nbusiness from January to March 2008. Fast-forward thirteen years, and in 2020, WNS'\u2019s top five clients accounted for only 25 per-\n\ncent of revenue.

We want evolvability. Correction. We need evolvability.

We need\n\nit to be able to adapt.\n\nHowever, just as evolutionary biologists struggle to measure evolvability,12 I haven\u2019t yet figured out a reliable way in advance\nto directly assess a company\u2019s propensity to adapt to a changing world. Many investors contend that management interviews and\ndiscussions are an excellent way to assess the future adaptability of a business. Maybe. I consider such interviews a waste of time\u2014\nbut more on that later (in chapter 7).\n\nBut there is an indirect\u2014and I would argue a reasonably reliable\u2014path of satisfying my need. It is by measuring the robust-\nness of an organization. Robustness lays the groundwork for evolution in living things. It does the same in businesses. Robustness\nis a necessary\u2014though not sufficient\u2014requirement for businesses to evolve successfully.\n\nIna robust business, just as in a living organism, evolvability comes free.\n\nTake the example of two businesses in an industry. Company A is the leader, and on sales of $100, it earns a margin of 20 per-\ncent. Let\u2019s assume its capital employed (in fixed assets, receivables, and inventory) is $50. Company A\u2019s ROCE is quite healthy at 40\npercent (100 x 20% = 50). Ifa company\u2019s growth is lower than its ROCE, it will also keep generating free cash flow, and so Company\nAhas no debt. Company B is a weak player in the industry with half the sales of Company A, $50, and a margin of 15 percent. Since\nit does not have enough bargaining power with suppliers (who demand early payment) or customers (who pay late), its capital\nemployed is the same as that of Company A ($50). Company B\u2019s ROCE is 15 percent (50 x 15% + 50). Company B has a debt of $10\n(which is not much, given its operating profit of $7.50), and its cost of debt is 5 percent.\n\nThus, both are earning decent ROCE and have a reasonably strong balance sheet\u2014Company A is better, but Company Bisn\u2019t\ntoo bad.\n\f"}, "001852.png": {"text": "All seems fine. Until it\u2019s not.\n\nCOVID-19 strikes, and the country goes into a lockdown. Sales at both companies fall by half, and so do the operating\nmargins. Company A, being a leader, can collect cash and liquidate inventory so that its capital employed falls to $25. Company B,\non the other hand, while suffering the same drop in sales and margins as Company A, is rebuffed by its customers while asking for\nmoney and is also unable to sell its finished goods in a demand-poor environment. Its capital employed stays flat at $50. Company\nA\u2019s ROCE is now 20 percent (50 x 10% = 25), and Company B\u2019s is 4 percent (25 x 7.5% = 50).\n\nThus, even during the pandemic, Company A earns a respectable ROCE, allowing it to invest in growth. Fortified by its ROCE\nof 20 percent, Company A can also borrow in the market if it needs to, since the cost of debt is just 5 percent and the company is\ndebt free. From being comfortably mediocre during the pre-pandemic era, Company B risks oblivion because it no longer has the\nmoney to invest in production, marketing, and distribution. At 4 percent ROCE, it would struggle to pay its debt at 5 percent. Given\n\nits precarious balance sheet and declining profits, lenders would also hesitate to lend it more money.\n\nAt least in the near term, a likely outcome is that Company A gains market share and Company B further loses its position.\nSince Company A had a higher degree of robustness owing to its high ROCE, it could adapt and evolve in an adverse external\n\nenvironment.\n\nWhat I have outlined is not a theoretical construct. We have seen this story play out in many of our businesses. When the\npandemic began, the general opinion was that all Indian businesses would suffer. Sharp stock market declines in March and April\n2020 mirrored this opinion. However, as the months passed, the differences in the impact on the business of companies with\ndifferential degrees of robustness became quite stark. During and after the COVID crisis, we have seen these divergent outcomes\n\nplay out across many of our companies and industries, be it paint, innerwear, air conditioners, tires, pipes, or batteries.\n\nOne of the best-run companies in our portfolio is Page Industries, which we were very fortunate to buy a few days after the\n\ncollapse of Lehman in late 2008.

We don\u2019t have data for the dozens of unlisted companies, but from anecdotal evidence and feed-\n\nback from industry insiders, it appears that Page\u2019s market share gain over this group during the pandemic has been even greater.\n\nI believe Page\u2019s robustness was a significant\u2014if not the primary or only\u2014reason for its continued success during the crisis.\nLet\u2019s see how Page scores on the various factors contributing to robustness listed in table 3.1. For the year ended March 2020,\nPage\u2019s ROCE was 63 percent, and it was debt free. It has highly fragmented customer and supplier bases. In my opinion, it has built\na deep and wide moat by investing in brand and distribution over twenty-five years. It has had the same owner since 1995. Its in-\n\ndustry is changing very slowly, with the top players remaining the same for more than a decade.\n\nThe greater the robustness, the greater the evolvability.\n\n\u2018We Demand Multiple Levels of Robustness in Our Businesses\n\nThere is an unbroken chain of life between us and our last universal common ancestor (scientists call it LUCA) 3.5 billion years\nago.12 Every part of this unbroken and evolving lineage has had robustness at multiple levels: genes, proteins, and body plan, to\nname just three. In a not dissimilar manner, I have discovered over more than two decades of investing that more levels of robust-\n\nness lead to more evolvability.\n\nLet\u2019s revisit table 3.1, which lists seven factors of robustness. As I have mentioned, there are more factors one can conjure\n\n \n\n(for example, propensity for M&A, governance), but let\u2019s stick with these seven for now. My aim is to point you in a certain direc-\n\ntion, not to spoon-feed.\n\f"}, "001854.png": {"text": "\u2018We want our companies to tilt toward the left side of table 3.1 across all factors.

You bet. We are permanent owners\u2014the key word here being \u201cpermanent.\u201d If a business can\u2019t last\npermanently, we don\u2019t want to own it. Without several levels of robustness, how will we be sure that the business will survive\nover the long term? I wish I could categorically answer the question, Is this a robust business? As a practicing investor, I know that\nassessing robustness is a matter of judgment and that there is no shortcut to this process. I have arrived at a certain heuristic after\nmany years of investing. There clearly are black-and-white extremes to robustness (e.g., a business with just two customers) but in\n\nmany, maybe even most, businesses, it is the gray zone that stares at us.\n\nFor example, is acompany with a debt/equity ratio of 2.0 robust? Probably not. What about a ratio of 0.2 or 0.5? Maybe. For\nme, the answer depends on the other factors of robustness. Almost all the companies in our portfolio are debt free. Still, in 2010 we\ninvested in India\u2019s leading plastic pipes business (used in homes and agriculture), Supreme Industries, whose debt/EBITDA ratio\nwas 0.6. Not high, but not zero either. Despite the company having debt\u2014which was small to begin with\u2014we concluded that the\ncompany was robust because it was the clear industry leader, had been gaining market share over its competitors, had a return on\ncapital of more than 30 percent, had successfully designed and launched many products over the past decade, had thousands of\ndistribution points across India, was able to negotiate the best terms with its suppliers, and had not wasted time and money on\nunnecessary acquisitions. It was not perfectly robust, but it was resilient enough. Today, the company is debt free and continues to\n\nbe the industry leader by a wide margin.\n\nThe more levels of robustness, the more we salivate.\n\nHighly Robust Businesses Evolve by Taking Calculated Risks\n\f"}, "001855.png": {"text": "As we have learned, neutral mutations make an organism robust while simultaneously planting the seeds of evolution. In the\nbusiness world, neutral changes may not have a short-term impact but may be transformational over the long run. The corporate\n\nphenomenon equivalent to biological neutral mutations can be summarized in two words: calculated risks.\n\nThere are millions of small businesses across the world that are incredibly robust but will stay small. And then there are\nbusinesses that test the limits of robustness and implode. The former risk nothing, and the latter risk everything. The Goldilocks\nzone between these two extremes is what I call \u201ccalculated risk.\u201d It is the degree of risk that makes managers uncomfortable, but\nnot too much; it compels the organization to innovate, but not too much; it forces the business to invest, but not too much; and it\n\nadds areas of potential growth, but not too many.\nTo me, the company that best demonstrates calculated aggression and risk-taking is Walmart.\n\nSmall digression. Let's see if you know the answer to this question: What was Sam Walton's age when he founded Walmart?\nIf your answer begins with a one or a two, your answer was the same as mine. And like I was, you are wrong. Sam Walton was\nforty-four when he opened his first Wal-Mart store in 1962 in Rogers, Arkansas (Wal-Mart became Walmart in 2018). Not all the\ngreat founders of the modern era are from Silicon Valley, not all of them were hard-charging teenagers, and not all of them wanted\n\nto \u201cchange the world.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from college, Walton started in sales at J. C. Penney in 1940, then enlisted for the war in 1942. In 1945, he\nstarted managing a franchise Ben Franklin store in Newport, Arkansas (where the population was then seven thousand). By 1950\nhe was running two stores in Newport and had achieved reasonable success by experimenting and innovating. One of his inno-\nvative ideas that had been a massive hit with his customers was an ice cream machine. As he writes in his autobiography, \u201cEvery\ncrazy thing we tried hadn\u2019t turned out as well as the ice cream machine, of course, but we hadn\u2019t made any mistakes we couldn\u2019t\n\ncorrect quickly, none so big that they threatened the business.\u201d\n\nCould there be a better definition of calculated risk?\n\f"}, "001856.png": {"text": "After Walmart\u2019s initial success in Rogers, Sam Walton opened more stores.!4 By 1967, he had opened twenty-four stores,\nwhich brought in sales of about $13 million. The company reached $1 billion in sales in 1980, by which time it had 276 stores and\nabout 21,000 associates. Note that store openings and selling more products through the same stores propelled growth from 1967\nto 1980. During these thirteen years, sales per store had increased about seven times. How had Walton done this? By continuously\n\ntrying new things, expanding product offerings, and broadening the customer base.\n\nNot all these experiments were successful. For example, in the early 1980s, Walton started two Hypermarts\u2014giant stores\nselling groceries and general merchandise\u2014in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. But the concept failed. He also experimented with dis-\ncounted drugs (dot Discount Drug) and home improvement (Save Mor), both of which shuttered. One of his experiments, however,\nworked spectacularly well. Sam\u2019s Club, focused on retailers who buy in bulk, was launched in 1983, and within a decade, it had\ncrossed revenue of $10 billion. The spectacular success of Sam\u2019s Club demonstrates the slight downside and colossal upside of tak-\n\ning manageable risks.\n\nAs discussed in chapter 1, most M&A fail, and the larger ones can destroy a business. Walmart has managed acquisitions\nthe way they should be managed: It has kept targets small and manageable and funded them without taking on large debt. The\ncompany made its first acquisition fifteen years after inception. It was close to $500 million in sales, and by this time, as is evident\nfrom his autobiography, Sam Walton was feeling quite confident about the future of the business. Even then, he behaved pru-\ndently by acquiring a small discount store business called Mohr Value in 1977, which was about one-tenth the size of Walmart. As\nhe says in his book, \u201cWe closed five stores and converted the remaining sixteen to Wal-Marts, and it wasn\u2019t much of a shock to our\n\nsystem.\u201d\n\nBy 1991, Walmart was present in forty-nine states, and the management started exploring options outside their home\ncountry. Almost two decades after the first store\u2019s inauguration, Walmart embarked on its maiden international foray by entering\ninto a joint venture with CIFRA, Mexico\u2019s largest retailer, and by 1997 it had acquired a majority position in CIFRA. Was this a \u201cneu-\n\ntral\u201d change? It sure seems like one in hindsight\u2014the Mexico joint venture started small and would not have impacted Walmart\u2019s\n\f"}, "001857.png": {"text": "US. operations. Also, a joint venture in a foreign country allowed Walmart to dip a toe to check the water temperature. Once the\ncompany had adjusted to the new geography, it felt confident in making a bigger commitment by acquiring the rest of CIFRA.\nStarting from scratch in 1991, Walmart\u2019s revenue from the international segment in 2020 was $120 billion, or 23 percent of com-\n\npany sales.15\n\nThe company did something similar\u2014small, measured, and low risk\u2014when it launched its web business. In 2000, Walmart\njoined hands with a leading Silicon Valley investment firm, Accel Partners, to launch Walmart.com. Accel, by the way, gained\nmuch fame (and a gargantuan fortune) as a result of its $12.7 million investment in an early-stage company called Facebook in\n2005.1. In about eighteen months, in mid-2001, Walmart acquired the minority stake of Accel to own Walmart.com fully. By\n2020, Walmart\u2019s e-commerce sales had climbed to $24 billion and Walmart.com was approaching 10 percent of Walmart\u2019s overall\nU.S. sales. What had started as a \u201cneutral\u201d strategy in 2000 is now fast becoming the centerpiece of Walmart\u2019s approach to gaining\n\nmarket share.\n\nOne of our largest investors is a well-known U.S. university endowment. They have been investing in funds globally for\nmany decades. Their CFO visited our Singapore office in 2011. After he had finished grilling us on compliance and other related\nmatters, I wanted to know if he could share any learnings with us. He said that the one industry in which their fund managers had\n\nconsistently lost money across time and geographies was retailing. In this context, Walmart\u2019s success is awe inspiring.\n\nAnd how robust was Walmart at the end of 2020? Let me point to just two indicators. Its return on tangible capital employed\nwas 46 percent. Thus, for day-to-day operations in 2020, it deployed $49.7 billion capital to earn an operating income of $22.9\nbillion. Its net debt level was just $26.8 billion, substantially lower than its equity value of $52 billion and EBITDA (earnings before\ninterest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) of $38 billion. Its continued robustness has helped the management take calculated\n\nrisks in the United States, as well as across the globe.\n\nI don\u2019t want to pretend that Walmart\u2019s success is solely the result of its slow-and-steady approach to growth and expansion.\n\n\u2018Walmart has undoubtedly flourished for many reasons. Apart from Sam Walton being the founder, though, I don\u2019t know what\n\f"}, "001858.png": {"text": "other factors have led to its success. I can rattle off a list of things from various business books and articles written on Walmart,\nbut I don\u2019t know if they were the cause or the effect of its success. But I do know that taking calculated risks and staying robustly\n\nhealthy have had a strong correlation with its accomplishments over sixty years.\n\nAs it has been for almost all the Nalanda portfolio companies. When we first invested in Page Industries in 2008, it primarily\n\nmanufactured and sold men\u2019s innerwear. Here are some of the milestones and neutral strategies implemented by Page since then:\n\n2008-09: Primarily a men\u2019s innerwear company\n\n2009-10: Launched women\u2019s leisurewear, men\u2019s sportswear\n\n2010-11: First store for women in Delhi, first training center for production staff\n2011-12: Boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 ranges, signed exclusive licensee agreement with Speedo\n2012-13: Sleepwear range for women, men\u2019s performance stretch range, thermals\n2013-14: New international-format retail outlets, seamless sleepwear for women\n2014-15: Exclusive outlets in Dubai, Abu Dhabi\n\n2015-16: Boys\u2019 collection (7-12 years)\n\n2017-18: Girls\u2019 inner- and outerwear, men\u2019s and women\u2019s athleisure\n\n2018-19: Teenage girls\u2019 range\n\n2019-20: First digital manufacturing unit with real-time production data\n\nThe remarkable aspect of this list is what it doesn\u2019t include. There are no acquisitions, no unrelated diversifications, no\n\u201cvisionary\u201d plans to change the world, no financial engineering. Only measured risks. For example, in 2009-10, the company\n\nlaunched men\u2019s sportswear. It did so through its existing distribution channel and staff, its current manufacturing units, and the\n\f"}, "001859.png": {"text": "same brand name. As the sportswear segment has expanded over the years, it now has its own supply chain, its own business unit,\n\nand its own advertisements.\n\nYou will notice here that the company launched a children\u2019s range in 2011-12. Page describes this natural extension of the\n\nJockey brand in its annual report: \u201cWith the launch of Jockey Kids, the brand reaches out to the consumers of tomorrow.... Keep-\n\n \n\ning comfort as our topmost priority, we have brought in a range using 100 percent cotton, super soft, absorbent fabric, for both\nboys and girls.\u201d As investors in Page, we were excited about this new target segment because it would double the Jockey brand\u2019s ad-\n\ndressable market.\n\nAfter seventeen years in India, Page had earned the right to extend its brand into a new segment. Unexpectedly, it failed. The\nchildren\u2019s range did not do well, and the company withdrew its products. Did this have any negative impact on the finance or oper-\nations of the company? No. This is because it was a calculated risk. It was a neutral strategy that did not affect the robustness of the\nbusiness. Its operating ROCE in 2011-12 was 59 percent and was even higher in 2012-13 (when it realized the children\u2019s range had\nfailed) at 64 percent. In 2012-13, overall sales grew 26 percent, and profits rose 24 percent. In both these years, the company had.\n\nnegligible debt. The advantage of having a solid foundation that allowed it to take small bets was evident.\n\nPage went back to the drawing board and launched only a boys\u2019 collection in 2015-16. Even within this segment, it intro-\nduced products only for boys aged seven to twelve years. Why not five- or thirteen-year-old boys? I have no idea. I don\u2019t understand\nproduct marketing, but thankfully Page does. It launched girls\u2019 inner- and outerwear a year later. By 2020, the boys\u2019 and girls\u2019\nranges had become a hit and had started contributing to the overall sales and profit growth of the business. What had started as a\nsmall experiment in 2011-12 was finally yielding fruit.\n\nAs India went into a full lockdown in mid-March 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company\u2019s annual sales grew\nonly 3 percent for the year ended March 2020. Profits fell 15 percent, but it delivered ROCE of 63 percent while remaining debt free.\n\nThis robustness, we believe, should allow the company to continue to take calculated strategic bets many years into the future.\n\f"}, "001860.png": {"text": "Robustness Is a Proxy for Evolutionary and Business Success but Doesn\u2019t Guarantee It\n\nDinosaurs, a diverse group of more than a thousand reptilian species, dominated our planet for 180 million years.12 As a matter\nof comparison, we Homo sapiens have been around for less than 0.2 million years. Dinosaurs couldn\u2019t have survived and thrived\nfor so long unless they were highly robust and adaptable. Molecular evidence has shown that many modern mammalian orders\n\u2014Carnivora, Primata, Proboscidea\u2014coexisted with dinosaurs for at least 30 million years during the Cretaceous period (145 to\n66 million years ago), and maybe even earlier. The mammals during the era of dinosaurs were small, squirrel sized, and probably\ninsectivores. If aliens had landed on our planet 65 million years ago, they never could have predicted that a small offshoot of the\ninsignificant mammalians would reign supreme one day.\n\nThe cataclysmic aftermath of an asteroid strike in the Yucatan peninsula 65 million years ago wiped out the dinosaurs. But\n\nthe mammals survived. No one is sure why. The extraordinary robustness of dinosaurs did not guarantee their evolvability.\n\nIn general, the greater the robustness, the greater the evolvability. But sometimes, robustness ceases to help businesses\nadapt. We can see this in Gap\u2019s failure to grow despite the company being very robust. Its revenue stayed flat at about $16 billion\nfrom 2005 to 2020, although it delivered ROCE of 20 percent or more for more than a decade and had no leverage. In general, mul-\ntiple levels of robustness are better than a single level. But sometimes, even multiple levels of robustness can\u2019t safeguard the future\nof a business, as has been the case for thousands of newspapers across the world. In general, highly robust businesses evolve by tak-\ning calculated risks. But sometimes, very rarely, businesses can succeed by taking huge risks, as shown by Netflix.\n\nWe at Nalanda never bet against the odds. And so, despite some rare counterexamples, we have kept and will continue to\nkeep robustness at the front and center of our investment approach. As permanent owners, we seek robustness in companies as\nthe best available benchmark to assess if they are likely to adapt and survive over the long term. A better measure may exist, but I\ndon\u2019t know what it is. We invest only in highly robust companies. Many of them have stayed robust and have grown their sales and\n\nprofits over decades. But our track record is not perfect. We have witnessed two key problems with this approach.\n\f"}, "001861.png": {"text": "First, a business can lose its robustness. We saw this happen to one of our consumer-focused companies; we still don\u2019t know\nhow or why it lost its way. We invested in this business almost twenty years after its creation. During that period, the management\nhad built the largest brand in its industry in the country. When we invested, the company had no debt, its sales had grown 20\npercent annually for the past five years, and it had delivered ROCE of more than 50 percent. Within a few years of our investing,\nthe company\u2019s inventory and receivables started climbing steeply, a leading indicator of potential sales issues. While the company\ncontinued to show profits, it had begun consuming cash\u2014while having been a cash generator in earlier years. As a result, it had to\nstart borrowing money just as its ability to repay the loans declined. Being a permanent owner, we are tolerant of declining sales\nor margins or market share. But we will not risk survivability. As the company\u2019s robustness nose-dived, we exited the business at a\nloss. The company survives but is a pale reflection of its former glory. This unexplained decline of robustness has occurred in our\n\nportfolio only once since our inception in 2007, but it has happened.\n\nThe second problem is too much robustness. One high-quality business in the Nalanda portfolio has been too robust. It has\nbeen unable or unwilling to implement any neutral strategies to expand its customer base, product segments, or geographies. As a\nresult, the company has grown its sales at less than 5 percent annually for a decade, and its profits have stayed flat during this pe-\nriod. To be fair, its industry has gone through a vicious downcycle, and this business is the only one among its peers that continues\nto generate profits and free cash flow, and it remains debt free. It is also the only business in our portfolio that has taken robustness\nto its extreme by eschewing calculated risks. Maybe it is in an industry in which it can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t. Perhaps when the industry\nupcycle arrives, it will finally see growth. Or maybe not. We will continue to remain owners in the business. While our returns\nhave been positive, they have been below par. But I love them\u2014they are a class apart in a very tough place. We are willing to sacri-\nfice growth for robustness.\n\nWe have made almost forty investments to date, and in all of them, robustness was a primary\u2014but not the only\u2014selection\ncriterion. We have worked on the assumption that robustness will lead to growth and evolution. This assumption has failed us\n\non two occasions: one in which the company lost robustness and another in which the company\u2019s excessive focus on robustness\n\f"}, "001862.png": {"text": "compromised growth. I am surprised at our strategy\u2019s low failure rate. We have been quite lucky, and while robustness should con-\n\ntinue to reward us across our portfolio, we will continue to encounter failures of the first or second kind over time.\n\nThe Only Way to Protect Against Loss of Robustness Is Entry Valuation\n\n\u201cConfronted with a like challenge to distill the secret of sound investment into three words, we venture the motto, MARGIN OF\nSAFETY\u201d (emphasis in the original text). This is the best advice for investors in the best chapter of the best investing book ever\nwritten: The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, Buffett\u2019s actual and spiritual mentor. The chapter is titled \u201c \u2018Margin of Safety\u2019\nas the Central Concept of Investment.\u201d Graham knew that the corporate world is highly uncertain and that the best protection\noffered to an investor is the price they pay for a business.\n\nAnother investment legend, Seth Klarman, offers the following advice in his book appropriately titled Margin of Safety: Risk-\nAverse Value Investing Strategies for the Thoughtful Investor: \u201cValue investing, the strategy of investing in securities trading at an\nappreciable discount from underlying value, has a long history of delivering excellent investment results with very limited down-\n\nside risk.\u201d\n\nIn this chapter, I have used the word \u201crobust\u201d to extend the margin-of-safety concept to many other facets of a company.\nWe have sought a margin of safety on business quality by demanding high ROCE and a wide competitive moat, on the strength of\nthe balance sheet by requiring it to be debt free, on the bargaining power of customers and suppliers by requiring them to be frag-\nmented, and on the sustainability of economics by insisting that the industry be slow-changing.\n\nBut even these multiple levels of robustness or margins of safety can become compromised owing to unpredictable changes\nin the economy, the industry, or the company. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted what had appeared to be highly\n\nrobust hotel chains; Intel\u2019s erstwhile dominance in semiconductor chips has been upset by the likes of AMD, Nvidia, and Samsung;\n\f"}, "001863.png": {"text": "Amazon has already destroyed many small and large retail businesses; regulators in the United States and Europe appear to be\n\nthreatening the very existence of Google and Facebook in their current form.\n\nWe do the best we can to choose businesses based on their current and potential degree of robustness.

The market is not an idiot; it is almost always efficient. Almost always. Not always. We\n\nwait for those few occasions to pay what we call a \u201cfair\u201d price. Not too low but not too high either.\n\nWhat is \u201cfair\u201d? Rather than describe it, let me state the actual number. The median trailing twelve-month (TTM) entry PE\nratio for the Nalanda portfolio is 14.9. The median TTM PE for the period from 2005 to 2020 for India\u2019s primary index, Sensex, is\n19.7 and for the Midcap Index is 23.8. Thus, we are buying what we think are exceptional businesses at a 25 to 30 percent discount\n\non the index.\n\nOver almost a quarter of a century of investing, I know I have been wrong on many occasions. The margin of safety of our\n\nentry price pays for my errors of judgment.\n\nA Leader Is Madea Loser\n\nLazarus of Bethany was miraculously brought back to life by Jesus in the New Testament.12 Charles Lazarus performed a modern\ncapitalist miracle by making Toys \u201cR\u201d Us the largest and most well-respected toy business globally. Lazarus is also a beggar ina\nparable in the Gospel according to Luke, the third of the four Gospels of the New Testament. Once a miracle of Lazarus, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us\n\nsuffered the same fate as Lazarus the beggar.\n\f"}, "001864.png": {"text": "Charles Lazarus opened his first Toys \u201cR\u201d Us store in 1957.12 In that era, parents typically went to department stores to buy\ntoys. Toy sales were seasonal, and the six weeks leading up to Christmas made up the bulk of sales for the year. Most toy stores were\nsmall family-run shops and carried only a small number of toys. Having operated a baby furniture business from 1948 to 1957\nand learned the shopping habits of parents, Lazarus decided to risk a new strategy. He wanted to sell toys throughout the year and\ngive parents and children a novel shopping experience. His first store was 25,000 square feet in size and stocked thousands of toy\nvarieties. The store did not keep toys in display cases as did its competitors; instead, it kept them in rows next to each other like\n\nitems ina grocery store.\n\nThe store was a massive hit given its size, variety, and low prices. Despite his initial success, Lazarus moved slowly at first\nand opened only four stores until 1966. In 1973, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us started advertising on TV using its store mascot, a cuddly giraffe\ncalled Geoffrey. Lazarus also began tapping Japanese manufacturers to make inexpensive toys and negotiated attractive rates\nfor bulk purchases. The company went public in 1978 and grew at more than 20 percent annually for the next decade.

It continued, however, to\ntake measured risks, one of which was the opening of a Kids \u201cR\u201d Us clothing store in 1983. The company also started expanding\noverseas and, in 1984, opened its first international stores in Canada and Singapore.

They\nscurry noisily at a surprisingly brisk pace. The males have impressive-looking horns, and the eight thousand species have almost\nas many different kinds of horns. Their shape resembles rhinoceros horns, elephant tusks, deer antlers, and even a serrated knife;\n\ntheir size varies from very small to massive. Some are even larger than the entire dung beetle\u2019s body.\n\nWhat explains these horns? One way evolutionary biologists describe them is through hormonal, developmental, and\ngenetic mechanisms. For example, a 2019 Science article provides evidence that dung beetles use wing genes to grow their horns.2\nThe wing genes get turned on in the early stages of the growth of the horns. Later, these genes switch off, and a new set of genes\ngrows and shapes the horns. An article in the Journal of Insect Physiology explores the types and quantities of hormones that con-\ntrol the length of horns in males.3 It showed that the hormone methoprene has a significant influence on the production of horns.\nThese scientists are asking \u201chow\u201d questions. How do the horns grow? How does horn length differ?\n\nAnother route of exploring the cause of horns is to understand the adaptive nature of them. These are \u201cwhy\u201d questions:\nWhy did horns arise? Why do they increase the fitness of the beetle? Why can horns be considered an adaptation? The selectionist\nexplanation contends that the horns of male dung beetles allow the bearer to garner more resources, defend their nests, and com-\npete for the best females, thereby reproducing more than the males without horns. For example, an article in the Journal of Insect\nBehavior describes an experiment providing evidence that males with larger horns get preferential access to females and thus can\nbe considered adaptive. The same article also describes the adaptive value of small horns in some males. These males have greater\nmobility and can sneak around the larger males to mate with the females!\n\nThe first category of explanations for the dung beetle\u2019s horns\u2014addressing the \u201chow\u201d question\u2014are called proximate causes,\n\nand the second\u2014addressing the \u201cwhy\u201d question\u2014are ultimate causes.

The history of the organism determines ultimate causes, specifically the role played by natural selection to favor\n\none trait versus another.\nTo elaborate further, let\u2019s talk about sex.\n\nOr more precisely, polyandry in the predatory mite species Neoseiulus californicus.4 Polyandry implies multiple matings by\nthe female of a species and is the opposite of polygyny, wherein a male succeeds in mating with multiple females. Bateman\u2019s prin-\nciple, named after an English geneticist, argues for the prevalence of polygyny in the animal kingdom. He contended that since\nfemales invest much more in offspring than do males, they are the limiting factor over which males compete, leading to polygyny.\nHowever, polyandry is more widespread than Bateman believed; in many species, females are not just waiting around to get im-\n\npregnated\u2014they are actively scouting for multiple partners. And one of these species is the mite N. californicus.\n\nBut what drives this mite to become polyandrous when the dominant trend in the animal world is toward polygyny? Peter\nSchausberger and his colleagues tackled this question in a PLoS One article, and they came up with two different sets of explana-\n\ntions: one \u201cproximate\u201d and one \u201cultimate.\u201d\n\nThe scientists discovered that the ultimate cause of polyandry in N. californicus consists of both direct and indirect fitness\nbenefits. Females that mated multiple times produced more offspring than females that mated just once, and these offspring also\nsurvived longer. As for the proximate cause, the authors identified a key one: first mating duration. If the females\u2019 first mating\nperiod was below a certain threshold (150 minutes), the likelihood of their continuing to seek male partners increased. The imme-\ndiate cause of females seeking more sex was a lack of sex. Who says science is boring?\n\nErnst Mayr, one of the greatest evolutionary biologists of the twentieth century, proposed the proximate-ultimate duality in\na landmark article titled \u201cCause and Effect in Biology\u201d in the journal Science in 1961.5\n\nUsing the example of bird migration, he posed the following question: \u201cWhy did the warbler on my summer place in New\nHampshire start his southward migration on the night of the 25th of August?\u201d He proposed four causes for this migration. First,\n\nan ecological cause: The bird would starve if it stayed in New Hampshire for the winter. Second, a genetic cause honed over mil-\n\f"}, "001875.png": {"text": "lions of years that induced the warbler to respond to external stimuli and gain selective advantage over warblers that did not\nmigrate. Third, an internal physiological cause that propelled the bird to leave once the number of daylight hours dropped below\nacertain level. And last, an external physiological cause that was reflected in a sudden drop in temperature on August 25. The\nwarbler was already physiologically ready for migration, and this sudden cold wave made it leave that day. Mayr called the first two\n\nexplanations ultimate causes and the latter two proximate causes.\n\nProblems of Proximate Focus\n\nAmong all the philosophical issues that we have imbibed from evolutionary biology, recognizing the difference between proximate\n\nand ultimate causes is right on top.\n\n\u2018We want the businesses we own to increase in value over the long run. And the only way for this to happen is for the com-\npany to perform well over many years, preferably decades. Investment success may not correlate with business success for a day\n\ntrader or short-term investor. But for us, the ultimate success of an investment is almost entirely dependent on the ultimate suc-\n\ncess of the business.\n\nIf you accept this premise, then as permanent owners, we should focus exclusively on the quality and performance of the\n\nbusiness over the long run. And that is what we do.\n\nHowever, this is easier said than done. In today\u2019s world of Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, WhatsApp, and other soul-\ndestroying inventions, it is not easy to escape the din of proximate noise that can drown out the desire to seek sources of ultimate\nsuccess. When there is a specter of a Greek default, an announcement of reduced jobs growth in the United States, OPEC negotia-\ntions break down, the Federal Reserve hints that the days of low interest rates are over, or company revenue falls, stocks can fall.\nSimilarly, a bullish projection by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on world growth, the recapitalization of banks in China,\n\nthe success of a new product launch, or the increased pace of vaccination for a global pandemic can lead to higher stock prices.\n\f"}, "001876.png": {"text": "All these are proximate causes of price movement.

They would try to guess what the average opinion ex-\n\npects the average beauty to be. And so on to even higher levels.\n\nKeynes had learned from bitter experience that this market guessing game is a colossal waste of time. In the 1920s, he used\na detailed economic model to predict market levels and failed to see the Great Crash of 1929. He also underperformed the market\nduring this period. He switched to picking stocks and, like Buffett, eschewed diversification. He declared, \u201cThe right method of in-\n\nvestment is to put fairly large sums of money into enterprises one thinks one knows something about.\u201d\n\nNo wonder he turned out to be an excellent investor. Keynes managed the endowment of King\u2019s College, Cambridge, from\n1924 to 1946. During this twenty-two-year period, he compounded the college\u2019s wealth by almost 14 percent a year. If someone\nhad invested \u00a3100 with Keynes at the start of 1924, it would have been worth about \u00a31,675 at the time of his death in 1946. The\nsame money invested in the UK stock market index would have been worth only \u00a3424. Astonishingly, this period included the\nGreat Crash of 1929, the Great Depression, and the Second World War.\n\nShould the financial world not have absorbed Keynes's insights? Ha!\n\nDecember 2019 looked like any other December, and the Wall Street stock market strategists were at it again\u2014forecasting\nmarket growth for 2020. Since the year 2000, the median Wall Street forecast has never predicted a stock market decline in the\nnext year. Yes, you read that right. Not once did the forecasters believe that the stock market could go down. The reality? The mar-\nket fell on six occasions. The median forecasts from the year 2000 to 2020 missed the actual number by 12.9 percent points\u2014more\n\nthan double the average annual increase of 6 percent over these years!\n\f"}, "001886.png": {"text": "Back to December 2019.

The median consensus among\nthe forecasters was that the market would rise by 2.7 percent in 2020.2 If the forecasters had known then that a pandemic would\nrage across the world from March 2020 until December 2020, what do you think their forecast for 2020 would have been? We will\nnever know, but I bet they would have predicted a huge fall in the market. In any event, the S&P 500 rose by 16.3 percentage points\nin 2020. But 2020's pandemic was a once-in-a-century event, and we should not hold it against the forecasters that they were\n\nwrong by 13.6 percentage points. Fair enough.\n\nWhat if we assess the forecast of an acknowledged master forecaster from early May 2020? Only eight months of the year\nremain, the pandemic has been raging for four months, and the dire impact on the economy seems quite evident.

In short, Dent embodies as much expertise as an expert can muster.\n\nIn early May 2020, in an interview with ThinkAdvisor, Dent predicted that the market would peak in August 2020 and that\ninvestors might be able to make a return of 5 to 10 percent. He advised them to \u201cget out\u201d and counseled against buying. How\nwrong was he? The market kept rising until December 31, and from the time of Dent\u2019s interview in early May, the S&P 500 rose\n32 percent!

So why do industry players\nspend so much time obsessing over future market levels? Why do fund managers devote enormous time and effort obsessing over\nwhat other fund managers think and do? Flawed incentives, false comfort, one-upmanship, you name it. It doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nWe ignore all market forecasts. Well, maybe not entirely.\n\nI do look at them on days when I want to have a good laugh.\n\nProximate Thematic Causes\n\nAt the end of annus horribilis 2020, I realized I was wrong by $6 billion.\n\nIn early September 2020, Nikola was a stock market darling. The start-up had listed barely a year earlier at a valuation of\n$4 billion. Its value had since quintupled to almost $20 billion. Led by its charismatic founder, Trevor Milton, who was often\ncompared to Elon Musk, Nikola was planning to develop semitrucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells and batteries. It had just an-\nnounced a partnership with GM wherein the Detroit giant would get an 11 percent stake for $2 billion in return for a contract to\nengineer and build Nikola\u2019s semitrucks.\n\nOn September 10, 2020, a reputed investment fund and short seller called Hindenburg Research published a scathing report\ntitled Nikola: How to Parlay an Ocean of Lies Into a Partnership with the Largest Auto OEM in America. The first line of the report\nstates that Nikola was \u201can intricate fraud built on dozens of lies over the course of its founder and executive chairman Trevor Mil-\nton\u2019s career.\u201d14\n\nIn 2017, to prove that its technology worked, Nikola shared a video titled \u201cNikola One in Motion,\u201d which showed its proto-\ntype semitruck speeding along a road. Hindenburg claimed that the company had simply towed an ordinary truck to the top of a\nhill in a remote area and had filmed it rolling down the hill. After the report was published, Nikola felt compelled to acknowledge\n\f"}, "001888.png": {"text": "this fact by stating, \u201cNikola never stated its truck was driving under its own propulsion in the video.\u201d What?! What else was a\n\nspeeding truck supposed to show? The road?\n\nThe revelation of this bare-faced lie was just the start of the lengthy report. Hindenburg\u2019s research unearthed several more\nproblems. Nikola did not have a battery technology despite Milton\u2019s claims to the contrary; it did not possess hydrogen fuel cell\nexpertise; Milton had a history of taking technology from others and then claiming it as his own; Milton also had a track record of\ntroubled partnerships that ended in failure, lawsuits, and recriminations; and Milton had claimed that Nikola\u2019s corporate head-\nquarters were completely off-grid and used 3.5-megawatt solar panels, though no headquarters existed. I could list many more\n\ndamning assertions made by Hindenburg in its lengthy report, but suffice to say that the future seemed bleak for Nikola.\n\nTrevor Milton resigned within a few days of the report, and GM ended its partnership discussions with the company. The\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice launched their own investigations. Unsurprisingly, the stock\n\nprice started crashing.\n\nHere is my question for you: What do you think Nikola\u2019s market value was at the end of December 2020, three months after\nthe Hindenburg expos\u00e9? Remember that the company had no battery or fuel cell technology, had no prototype, its founder had\nexited ignominiously, GM had terminated the partnership, and the government had begun investigating fraud. My answer would\nbe close to zero.\n\nNope. It was $6 billion!\n\nThe Hindenburg report appeared to be fact based: They backed up almost all their assertions with documents, photographs,\ntext messages, videos, and interviews. I am in no position to double-check their research. However, the facts that Milton resigned\nand GM terminated the partnership seem to indicate that a reasonable portion\u2014if not all\u2014of the report was credible. If so, how\ndoes one explain a $6 billion valuation for a company like Nikola? That\u2019s an unfair question because I doubt anyone fully under-\n\nstands how companies are valued. But in this case, I want to offer a two-word answer.\n\nThematic investing.\n\f"}, "001889.png": {"text": "The theme being \u201cnew-age automotive companies will rule the world.\u201d Automotive tech start-ups have been a rage since\n2020.15 According to an article in the Financial Times in January 2021, these companies had amassed a market value of $60 billion,\nbut most had not generated a single dollar of revenue. And why didn\u2019t they have any revenue? Because, like Nikola, they didn\u2019t even\n\nhave a product! The popular saying \u201cfact is stranger than fiction\u201d is tailor made for the valuation of new-age automotive start-ups.\n\nThe FT article names nine listed start-ups, the largest of which was QuantumScape, valued at $19 billion. This company\nprojects its first revenue of $14 million in 2024. In 2028, just four years after generating its first revenue, the company expects to\ntouch $10 billion revenue! As a matter of comparison, after recording its first revenue in 2008, Tesla took nine years to cross $10\nbillion. And remember that Tesla had the lion\u2019s share of the market in those years. The QuantumScape website proclaims that the\ncompany\u2019s mission is \u201cto revolutionize energy storage to enable a sustainable future.\u201d Its investors range from blue-blooded ven-\n\nture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins and Lightspeed to car companies like Volkswagen and SAIC.\n\nAnd there were many others. Hyliion\u2019s market value was $2.6 billion, and it was planning to manufacture hybrid trucks;\nVelodyne Lidar, $3.9 billion, sensing solutions for autonomous vehicles; Fisker, $4.1 billion, electric cars; Luminar Technologies,\n\n$10.1 billion, object detection technology; Canoo, $4 billion, electric vehicles. You get the picture.\n\nA foolproof method of checking the interest level in a concept or theme is to analyze Google searches using Google Trends. If\nyou do so for the term \u201celectric vehicles\u201d between January 2014 and January 2019 in the United States, you will see a relatively flat\ntrend. However, between January 2019 and February 2021, interest in electric vehicles quadrupled. Now, check out the dates the\n\ncompanies just mentioned went public:\n\nNikola June 2020\nVelodyne Lidar September 2020\nFisker October 2020\n\nHyliion October 2020\n\f"}, "001890.png": {"text": "QuantumScape November 2020\nCanoo December 2020\n\nLuminar December 2020\n\nIdon't know if the IPOs of these companies increased the interest level in the search term or whether the increased searches\nof \u201celectric vehicles\u201d were a leading indicator of public listings. Maybe they just fed each other in a positive feedback loop. What-\never the case may be, as you can see, there is a strong correlation between the theme of electric vehicles and the IPOs of these busi-\nnesses\u2014a classic example of a strong proximate mechanism at work.\n\nIn addition, in January 2021, there were at least eight to ten more private start-ups ready to go public, all with obvious-\nsounding names like ChargePoint, EVgo, Lightning eMotors, Lion Electric, and Motiv Power Systems. If the market value of the\nlisted companies holds, I bet that in the next few years, there will be dozens more listed companies with this theme.\n\nThese companies, valued at billions, with not even millions in revenue, epitomize investment strategies based on proximate\nthemes. Like almost every proximate theme before and since, the automotive tech theme has three properties. It hypes up total ad-\ndressable market (TAM), is simple to understand, and is actionable.\n\nFirst, TAM. Every theme I have encountered since the start of my investing career in 1998 plays on the enormous size of the\naddressable market. And the size is usually so large that it dwarfs the businesses currently operating in that industry or theme. No\nwonder it is usually the most salient proximate cause of a theme gone wild.\n\nIn March 2021, a UBS report touted the zero-emission trucking market as potentially $1.5 trillion in size, and current man-\nufacturers and start-ups raced to grab dominance. Tesla, which did not manufacture trucks in March 2021, had revenue of \u201conly\u201d\n\n$32 billion in 2020.\n\f"}, "001891.png": {"text": "In my experience, there is only one problem with chasing a proximate theme based on TAM. It\u2019s useless. It makes astrology-\nbased forecasts look respectable. TAM is pointless because it does not tell us whether any profits will be made, and even if a busi-\nness can be profitable, TAM is silent on who will make that moolah.\n\nOne of the largest TAMs is that of apparel and footwear.\u2018 The U.S. market for apparel and footwear is about $370 billion. Itis\nalso one of the hardest places to make money. The lack of robustness of this industry was also evident during the pandemic when\nscores of apparel and footwear companies declared bankruptcies: Brooks Brothers, Centric Brands, Century 21, G-Star, JCPenney,\n\nJ. Crew, John Varvatos, Neiman Marcus, Tailored Brands, and many more. Someone forgot to tell these companies that their TAM\nwould save them.\n\nEven prepandemic, most apparel brands struggled to grow and make a decent income. Take the example of a well-known\nbrand like Gap. It hasn\u2019t grown in the United States since 2007, with sales almost flat at $15 to $16 billion, and it achieved its peak\nnet income of $1.3 billion back in 2014. Guess\u2019s revenue fluctuated between $2 billion to $2.6 billion between 2009 and 2020, and\nits ROCE hasn\u2019t crossed 10 percent since 2016. Abercrombie & Fitch\u2019s revenue in 2006 was $3.3 billion, and it grew to only $3.6 bil-\nlion by 2019. It, too, has not earned more than 10 percent ROCE since 2014.\n\nThe global market for apparel and footwear is about $1.9 trillion, a colossal TAM. But the only apparel companies that seem\nto consistently grow their sales and churn profits are H&M, Uniqlo, and Zara. Other industries like airlines, restaurants, infrastruc-\nture, banking, and retailing are the same. Their TAMs are quite high, but most industry players don\u2019t make any money. So what use\nis TAM to a long-term investor?\n\nThe second reason for the seductiveness of a proximate theme is its simplicity. Even a casual reader of business news will\nbe aware of themes like e-commerce, renewable energy, electric vehicles, fintech, food delivery, artificial intelligence, self-driving\n\ncars, infrastructure, and biotech. Unlike economic forecasting, which is full of jargon like \u201cGDP\u201d and \u201cmonetary supply,\u201d a layper-\nson can relate to themes. Anyone can understand what renewable energy is and that the country needs a lot more infrastructure\n\ninvestment. For the automotive tech start-ups, the simple argument goes as follows. Electric and autonomous vehicles will con-\n\f"}, "001892.png": {"text": "quer the world, and since Tesla\u2019s market value is $700 billion, shouldn't this theme capture trillions of dollars of value in the near\n\nfuture? And if so, why shouldn't a start-up be valued at billions of dollars? The premise is seductive because it is straightforward.\n\nThird, it is actionable. If you believe in the theme that consumers will order more food sitting at home because it is cheaper\nand easier than dining out, you can invest in DoorDash or Deliveroo. Are you interested in an electric vehicle company with actual\nrevenues? Hail Tesla. Do you believe in the providers of technology rather than the car? Velodyne Lidar beckons. Do you think\n\ntrucks are a bigger opportunity? Nikola is pining for you. Why does it matter that its founder was probably a charlatan?\n\nI don\u2019t know where the theme of automotive start-ups will end up in 2025 or 2030. What I do know, based on the history of\n\ncapital markets and new-age technologies like railways and the internet, is that this theme will face its comeuppance someday.\n\nMany readers will (not fondly) remember the theme ascendant in the early 2000s that home prices will rise forever. Any\nbank or financial company riding this theme was rewarded with increasing stock prices. Now we know that home prices don\u2019t\nkeep rising, and pricier homes bought with heavy borrowing need to fall in price only slightly for panic to set in. No one investing\nin the theme \u201chomes are an unbeatable investment\u201d could have imagined that the following marquee names would go bankrupt or\nneed a huge bailout: Lehman (assets of $691 billion), Washington Mutual ($328 billion), CIT Group ($80 billion), Thornburg Mort-\ngage ($39 billion), General Growth Properties ($30 billion), and several more.\n\nThe Indian market is no different. At various times since the start of my investing career in 1998, I have witnessed the\nfollowing themes create and then destroy billions of dollars of value in the capital markets: real estate, infrastructure, education,\nmicrofinance, consumer lending, and technology services. In addition, until early 2022, on paper, the following themes have cre-\nated (but not yet destroyed) a lot of value in Indian private markets: edtech, fintech, e-commerce, software-as-a-service (SaaS), lo-\n\ngistics, and social media. Based on history, many of these concepts will crater; I just don\u2019t know which ones or when.\n\nHow should we separate the proximate causes from the ultimate ones when there is euphoria or bearishness in a theme?\n\nUnfortunately, I am not aware of a foolproof method for doing so. But here is what we do.\n\f"}, "001893.png": {"text": "We define our unit of analysis clearly as the company. Not the economy, not the market, not a theme. We care about the fun-\n\ndamentals of the company\u2014nothing else. We have never invested in a theme and never will.\n\nAgain, just to be clear, Iam not implying that thematic investing is flawed. Maybe some fund managers can do it success-\nfully.\n\n\u2018We would if we could, but we can\u2019t, so we won't.\n\nProximate Company-Specific Causes\n\nIn December 2016, after almost three years of Vaibhav Global\u2019s continuous underperformance, for the first time we actively de-\n\nbated whether we should exit entirely. Were we confusing an ultimate cause for a proximate one?\n\nVaibhav is a retailer of low-priced jewelry and other accessories in the United States and the United Kingdom that sells\nthrough TV and the internet. One can shop at https://www.shoplc.com in the United States or https://www.tjc.co.uk in the United\nKingdom. Please do\u2014you will find its deals unbeatable. Vaibhav competes primarily with home shopping giants like QVC and\n\nHSN, as well as hundreds of other online and offline retailers.\n\nWe invested in Vaibhav in late 2007. After underwhelming performance for a few years, the company grew its revenue and\noperating profit at an annualized rate of about 30 percent from the year ended March 2011 to 2014. In July 2014, the stock price hit\nan all-time high of INR 174; our buy price was INR 48. Sunil Agarwal, the founder and CEO, had done a stellar job in recent years.\n\nHowever, from April 2014, the company\u2019s sales and profits started falling primarily owing to three self-inflicted missteps.\nFirst, Vaibhav did not respond to a significant strategic move by competition in the United States. Every major competitor of Vaib-\nhav had started offering customers an option to pay in installments. However, Vaibhav refused to follow in their footsteps. Sunil\n\ndid not want to take an unnecessary financial risk. Also, Vaibhav\u2019s average sale price is only about $20 to $25 per piece compared\n\f"}, "001894.png": {"text": "to $50 to $100 for competition. Sunil thought that customers would not care about installments if they got a quality product at a\n\nlow enough price. It turns out that they did.\n\nSecond, the company faltered in designing and implementing a robust technology platform. The company lagged behind\nall its peers on the quality of its customer-facing websites and apps. Even some of its back-end technology platforms (e.g., which\nhelped decide which products to merchandise when) were outdated and inflexible. Vaibhav\u2019s internet sales accounted for 16 per-\ncent of company revenue, whereas this number was 51 percent for QVC. The company fired its head of technology, but the new\n\nleader was taking time to fix the problems.\n\nLast, Vaibhav lost a few key senior managers. Sunil had fired some of them, but some had left for greener pastures. He was\n\nalso finding it hard to attract quality talent to fill the vacancies.\n\nFrom the year ended March 2014 to March 2016, sales fell by 2 percent, but profits declined by almost 70 percent. ROCE\ncollapsed from 55 percent in 2014 to 13 percent in 2016. The stock market had reacted appropriately: Vaibhav\u2019s stock price was\nINR 54 in December 2016, a fall of almost 70 percent from its previous peak in July 2014.\n\n\u2018We were now in a dilemma. Were these problems\u2014a delay in responding to competition, the lack of a robust technology\nplatform, a paucity of senior leaders\u2014proximate causes of stock price decline? Or did these headaches reflect a more fundamental\nand long-term issue with the company? Were these issues \u201cfixable,\u201d or should we abandon any hope of revival? We are permanent\nowners in businesses and do not sell unless there is irreparable damage to a business. Were these lapses temporary, or would the\n\ncompany be able to overcome this adversity?\n\nAs Ihave discussed in this chapter, we ignore proximate problems related to the economy, the market, and even the industry.\nBut the dilemma is much trickier to address when the proximate cause of problems relates to the company itself. Suppose the\nsales growth and profitability of the company has declined in the past few quarters, whereas its main competitors showed no such\n\nstruggle. How would you decide if the performance issues are related to proximate (and hence temporary) causes or ultimate (and\n\f"}, "001895.png": {"text": "hence more permanent) causes? In my experience, developing a method and an instinct to separate proximate and ultimate causes\nof failure or success when they relate to a company event is invaluable for a long-term investor.\n\nI have been an investor for more than two decades, and this is where I stumble most often. As usual, at the extremes, the\ndecision is straightforward. If the share price declines owing to a downturn in one or two quarters, we ignore the decline, consider-\ning it a proximate event. But if the decline results from a loss of market share for three years in a row, we ask if there is something\nfundamentally wrong with the business. It is the gray area in between these extremes that creates the worst headaches for us. I do\n\nnot know of any foolproof method of cracking the conundrum; the answer is almost always very company specific.\nVaibhav was in this gray zone. Maybe the proximate issues indicated ultimate problems, but maybe they didn\u2019t.\n\nWe decided to stay with the business. Under Sunil\u2019s leadership, the company had performed exceedingly well until only\nthree years earlier, and nothing had changed in the market since then. There were no new entrants, and customer behavior re-\nmained the same. More importantly, Vaibhav\u2019s competitive position of selling jewelry and accessories in the range of $20 to $25\nremained intact even during the difficult years. None of its competitors was able or willing to match Vaibhav\u2019s value proposition.\nAlso, as time passed, we saw Sunil taking timely steps to address the issues. Late in 2014, he started offering installment plans,\nwhich put a stop to customer attrition. Despite declining profits, he invested aggressively in building the technology team and\ninfrastructure. Finally, as he promoted some internal staff to leadership positions instead of hiring from outside, we could discern\nsome early signs of progress.\n\nLuckily for us, Sunil and his team did turn the business around. Sales grew by 11 percent annually from the year ended\nMarch 2016 to 2020, but, more impressively, operating profits grew almost five-fold. ROCE jumped from 13 percent to 45 percent\nduring this period, and the annual free cash flow almost quadrupled. The stock price jumped six-and-a-half-fold from INR 54 in\nDecember 2016 to INR 352 in September 2022.\n\nVaibhav may have turned out well for us (for now). But this was a touch-and-go decision. It could have gone either way. Our\n\ninstinct to stay in business as permanent owners helped us stay the course. Most importantly, we got very lucky.\n\f"}, "001896.png": {"text": "The Pain and the Gain of Headline Harassment\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the question I raised at the beginning of the chapter. You have sunk $70,000 in a fund that is now worth $36,000.\nEverything the fund manager touches seems to be heading down. Apart from continuing to tear your hair out, what should you\ndo?\n\nNothing.\n\nAt the end of the anecdote, the time was March 2009. If you had done nothing and continued to hold the fund, your $36,000\nwould be worth a little more than $770,000 at the end of September 2022. Which is a multiple of 21.4 times over 13.5 years. In\n\ncomparison, the main stock index grew six-fold during these years.\n\nAs you may have guessed, this was not a hypothetical situation. I have described what transpired at Nalanda. What you see\nin the numbers I've given is the result of our aggressive buying during the global financial crisis of 2008 and its dramatic longer-\nterm impact on the fund\u2019s performance. The only change you would need to make is to switch dollars to rupees.12 Your patience\n\nwould have paid. A lot.\n\nAs the Indian market started falling from March 2008, we started buying high-quality businesses, and we did not stop until\nearly 2009. The further the market fell, the greater our buying frenzy was. In December 2008, the fund had delivered an annual-\nized return (called the internal rate of return, or IRR, in investing parlance) of -55 percent (!), and we continued to invest as much\nas we could. The fund\u2019s annualized rupee return as of September 2022 was 20.3 percent (after payment of all fees and expenses).\n\nWhat allowed us to invest when the world seemed to be coming to an end? We ignored all proximate causes of stock price\n\ndecline and focused exclusively on the ultimate sources of success of a business. Let\u2019s walk through an example.\n\nOur most successful investment to date is Page Industries. In October 2008, the company had a stellar track record of perfor-\n\nmance over more than a decade and was the number-one innerwear brand in the country. It had overtaken competitors that had\n\f"}, "001897.png": {"text": "started many decades before it entered India in 1995. Over the previous five years, the company had grown revenue at 32 percent\n\nper year and had earned 57 percent ROCE.\n\nOn October 7, 2008, three weeks after Lehman\u2019s collapse, we bought 8 percent of the company for INR 455 per share. This\n\u2018was a 23 percent premium to the prevailing stock price of INR 370 per share. We took a notional loss the very next day after our\npurchase. In fact, the stock price did not cross our buy price for six months, until April 2009. At the end of July 2022, Page was at\n\nINR 48,873, a multiple of 107 times our buy price. During this period, the Sensex went up 5.5 times.\n\nOur view on Page and seven other businesses we bought during the financial crisis was that global events may affect the\nstock prices of high-quality companies but not their business strength; the fact that investors were dumping stocks was not a prob-\nlem but an opportunity; businesses\u2019 market valuations may take a hit but not their intrinsic value; the opportunity cost of not in-\nvesting in troubled times far exceeds any near-term pain owing to notional losses. Our success with Page is only partly the result of\nour aggression at a time of market panic; it is largely the result of our unwillingness to sell a great business at any price. But more\n\non that later.\n\nThe title of section II of this book is \u201cBuy High Quality at a Fair Price.\u201d This is a nice-sounding strategy but far from easy to\nimplement in practice.

One oft-repeated complaint is the\nmisalignment of incentives for the fund manager. The fund management company gets paid based on the size of the fund, not\non its performance. But over the long term, many researchers have found that an increase in fund size can lead to declining per-\nformance. For example, in a study published in 2009 in the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, an analysis of actively\nmanaged funds in the United States from 1993 to 2002 demonstrated a \u201csignificant inverse relation between fund size and fund\nperformance.\u201d! Similarly, in a 1996 article in the journal Financial Services Review, the authors write, \u201cOnce large, equity funds do\n\nnot outperform their peers.\u201d2 They go on to advise investors to invest in smaller funds.\n\nIn some ways related to the problem of misaligned incentives, another reason fund managers underperform is that funds\ndon\u2019t like to underperform the market. Yes, ironic, isn\u2019t it? In their attempt not to underperform the market, funds end up under-\nperforming! Here is how. For simplicity\u2019s sake, let\u2019s assume there are ten stocks in an index, each with a weight of 10 percent. If the\nfund invests $100 in the market, with $10 invested in each business, it has perfectly replicated the index. In such a case, its active\n\nshare is said to be zero. If the fund invests in none of these stocks, its active share is 100 percent.\n\nThus, active share is a measure of the courage and conviction of fund managers. Those unwilling to risk their careers, but\nhappy to compromise returns for their investors, have a low active share. The daring ones willing to stick their necks out and not\n\nmimic the index have a high active share.\n\nIna 2013 Financial Analysts Journal article, the author, Antti Petajisto, calculates the active share of 1,380 mutual funds in\n\nthe United States in 2009 and concludes, \u201cThe performance of closet indexers has been predictably poor.\u201d3 He also points out that\n\f"}, "001904.png": {"text": "funds with a high active share add value for investors. Of the mutual funds he examined, only 44 percent had an active share of\n\nmore than 80 percent.\n\nHave you heard the saying that no one gets fired for hiring IBM? Something similar seems to be going on in the fund manage-\nment industry. If a fund manager has a low active share, they are unlikely to get beaten by the market by a significant margin, and\nsince everyone else is in the same boat, their risk of getting fired is relatively low. At least one thing fund managers have learned\n\nfrom herbivores in the wild is that there is safety in numbers.\n\nThere are many other reasons for fund managers\u2019 underperformance. For example, poor performance also correlates with\nhigher portfolio turnover, owning stocks with greater liquidity, investing in growth stocks, higher expense ratios, and many other\nfactors. You can find all these and many more reasons for the dismal performance of fund managers in numerous research articles\nin prestigious finance journals.\n\nWhat you will not find in these articles is the crux of this chapter. I believe a crucial reason for the continued underperfor-\nmance of fund managers is their focus on future rewards while ignoring the treasures of the past.\n\n\u2018We at Nalanda pursue the profession of investing the same way evolutionary biologists do: We interpret the present in the\ncontext of history. Evolutionary biology does not make predictions as physics and chemistry do. Nor do we. Instead, our invest-\nment approach attempts to explain the present by interpreting what occurred in the past.\n\nIn an essay on the theory of evolution, the late Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote, \u201cThe present becomes\nrelevant, and the past, therefore, becomes scientific, only if we can sum the small effects of present processes to produce observed\n\nresults.\u201d He could have been writing about the way we invest.\n\n\u201cHow Extremely Stupid Not to Have Thought of That\u201d\n\f"}, "001905.png": {"text": "Let\u2019s join the young Charles Darwin, who has embarked on a life-altering journey aboard the Beagle.5 Although Darwin attained\nfame as a zoologist and botanist, he boarded the Beagle as an enthusiastic geologist. Darwin\u2019s first foray as a scientist was with his\nprofessor Adam Sedgwick when they tried to map the geology of Northern Wales in the summer of 1831. He concluded after this\ntrip that \u201cscience consists in grouping facts so that the general laws or conclusions may be drawn from them.\u201d At the end of the\nBeagle expedition, he had 368 pages of zoology notes compared to 1,383 pages of geology notes.\u00a3\n\nThe famous geologist Charles Lyell was a great inspiration to Darwin. He took the first volume of Lyell\u2019s book Principles of\nGeology with him on the Beagle. He received the second volume later in the voyage and read the third after his return home. Lyell\nwas a strong proponent of Uniformitarianism as the core tenet of geology; Darwin would later adopt it as a guiding principle of his\nevolutionary theory. Uniformitarianism claims that all significant changes on Earth result from slow and steady natural processes\noperating over millions of years.\n\nAsa result of his interest in and exposure to geology, Darwin was preprogrammed to conceptualize very long periods\nunimaginable to most humans. He was the first to comprehend the importance of deep time in evolution. He wrote, \u201cI always feel\nas if my books came half out of Lyell\u2019s brain, and that I have never acknowledged it sufficiently. . .. I have always thought that great\nmerit of Principles was that it altered the whole tone of one\u2019s mind.\u201d\n\nDarwin wrote more than twenty-five books,? and hundreds more have been written about him and his oeuvre. We can\u2019t\ncover even a fraction of his genius here. In this chapter, I want to focus on only one aspect of his method, which is evident in his\ngroundbreaking book On the Origin of Species: his focus on historical information to make deductions about ongoing evolutionary\nprocesses.\n\nDarwin proposed not one, not two, but three revolutionary theories in Origin: natural selection, sexual selection, and com-\nmon ancestry. Let\u2019s briefly see what these theories are and how he used history in all of them to arrive at his radical explanation of\n\nall organic life.\n\nFirst, let's discuss his best-known theory: natural selection.\n\f"}, "001906.png": {"text": "In my layperson\u2019s view, the reason Darwin\u2019s crowning achievement\u2014the theory of natural selection\u2014was not discovered\nearlier and remained unaccepted by many stalwarts during and after his lifetime was that few understood the powerful effect of\nsmall changes accumulated over very long periods of time. But for those who understood the relevance of history, the theory was\nso powerful and straightforward that the famous biologist Thomas Huxley remarked, \u201cHow extremely stupid not to have thought\n\nof that.\u201ds\n\nNatural selection requires three key ingredients.2 First, there needs to be random variation among the progeny of an organ-\nism. Note the word \u201crandom.\u201d Variation does not seek any goal. Second, there needs to be differential fitness among these variants\nsuch that injurious variations get rejected and favorable ones are preserved. Last, the favorable traits must be heritable so that they\nare passed on to the next generation. Then, these three elements repeat ad infinitum over millions, even billions, of years. Result-\ning in a pangolin from a protozoan. In Darwin\u2019s own words, \u201cThis preservation of favorable individual differences and variations,\n\nand the destruction of those which are injurious, I have called natural selection.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s look at giraffes to understand Darwin\u2019s insight. They are members of the order Artiodactyla and diverged from the\n\nother members\u2014cattle, antelope, deer, and sheep\u2014about thirty-four million years ago.12\n\nAn ancestor of the current giraffe may have given birth to a baby with a slightly longer neck owing to a random mutation.\n\nThere was no reason for this mutation; the animal was not looking to grow a longer neck. It just happened.\n\nThis long-necked creature may have had better nutrition on reaching adulthood than its herbivore competitors because it\ncould reach taller trees to eat more succulent shoots and leaves. Better and more food could have made this giraffe healthier and\nmore robust, helping it evade predators. Consequently, it could have mated more frequently and produced more offspring than its\nshorter-necked competitors. These offspring would generally have had long necks, but neck length would have varied. The longer-\nnecked ones would be likely to have better nutrition, be subject to lower predation, and have more mates than their shorter-necked\nsiblings. And because long necks are heritable (Darwin did not know that genes are responsible for heredity, but he knew that\n\nsomething was), some of the offspring of these longer-necked giraffes would also have had longer necks and continue to be more ad-\n\f"}, "001907.png": {"text": "vantaged than their shorter-necked siblings and competitors, generation after generation. This arms race for long necks has gone\n\non for millennia, and voila, we have the current-day giraffe.\n\nDarwin collated a vast range of historical clues to arrive at his theory of natural selection, and this is not the place to list all of\n\nthem. So instead, let me share just a few.\n\nDarwin was a creationist when he started his journey aboard HMS Beagle. \u201cWhilst on board the Beagle, I was quite orthodox,\u201d\nhe writes in his autobiography.1! At Cambridge, Darwin had studied the books of Reverend William Paley, who had made the fa-\nmous watch analogy to prove the existence of God.12 Paley\u2019s argument ran as follows. He asserted that if someone were to finda\nwatch with all its complex machinery lying on the ground, one would conclude that someone knowledgeable had produced it. The\nvarious parts of the watch, working in perfect unison, could not have been assembled by accident. Hence, Paley argued that since\n\nnature is infinitely more complex than a watch, we must conclude that an intelligent designer is behind the universe\u2019s creation.\n\nAs Darwin sailed around the world observing nature, collecting specimens, and writing copious notes, he started harboring\ndoubts. Then, in 1832, he found his first fossil remains in an Argentinian bay called Punta Alta. The fossilized thigh bone and teeth\n\nseemed to be from an extinct giant sloth.\n\nGeorges Cuvier, the founder of paleontology, showed that the earth had witnessed many extinction episodes and presented\ntwo indisputable facts.+2 First, the fossil remains of the past have no living peers; second, the older the fossil, the greater the diver-\ngence from living species. However, Cuvier explained these facts by invoking God, claiming that God repopulated the earth with\nnew species after each extinction.\n\nIf this were so, Darwin wondered, why would today\u2019s sloths have a very similar bone structure to the extinct sloths of the\npast? If God had created them independently, why did the extinct giant sloth and the currently living sloth species appear related?\nHe found many more fossils during the voyage, and the question continued to trouble him.\n\nOne of the core tenets of creationism is that God populated similar plants and animals in comparable climatic and physical\n\nenvironments. But Darwin discovered that this wasn\u2019t so. The creatures on the tropical Galapagos Islands did not resemble the\n\f"}, "001908.png": {"text": "flora and fauna of the tropics elsewhere in the world. Instead, they seemed closely allied with the organisms on the mainland of\nSouth America. As he wrote in Origin, \u201cThe most striking and important fact for us is the affinity of the species which inhabit is-\n\nlands to those of the nearest mainland, without being actually the same.\u201d14\n\nDarwin\u2019s ornithologist friend, John Gould, informed him in March 1837 that twenty-five of the twenty-six birds from Gala-\npagos were endemic to the islands and found nowhere else.15 Creationism\u2019s contention had always been that God created species\nindividually and that all species remained unchanged following their creation.1\u00a2 But then, how did one explain the diversity of the\nGalapagos bird species? All were similar to, but also quite different from, mainland species. Darwin reached a much different con-\nclusion: that a species of bird from the mainland had accidentally arrived on Galapagos eons ago and had then diverged into many\n\nspecies occupying different niches.\n\nTo me, one of the best examples of Darwin's remarkable ability to view history in a new light is his discussion of domestic\npigeons in the first chapter of Origin. He studied the pigeons closely for many years. He bought every breed he could lay his hands\non and reared them himself. He also procured pigeon skins from as far away as Persia. He made friends with many well-regarded\nLondon breeders and joined two pigeon clubs. Pigeons were big business in nineteenth-century England, and they obsessed Dar-\n\nwin as well.\n\nOver six pages of Origin, Darwin outlines the distinctiveness of various breeds. He starts, \u201cCompare the English carrier and\nthe short-faced tumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks, entailing corresponding differences in their skulls.\u201d\nNext, he described various breeds\u2019 diversity of beaks, sizes, shapes, colors, and flight patterns. Like most naturalists of the era, he\nbelieved that all these varieties had descended from an ancestral rock pigeon (Columba livia). In Origin, he also provides ample evi-\ndence for this belief.\n\nHis friend Professor Lepsius had informed Darwin that humans had been domesticating pigeons for thousands of years\u2014\n\nthere were records of pigeons in the fifth Egyptian dynasty in 3000 BCE. Pigeons also had high prestige and monetary value in the\n\f"}, "001909.png": {"text": "time of the Romans and Mughals in India. It was evident that humans had altered pigeons over many years to suit their unique\n\ntastes. He called this phenomenon \u201cartificial selection.\u201d\n\nAnd then he took the bold leap that no one else had taken before him. He asserted, \u201cSlow though the process of selection may\nbe if a feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of change, to the infinite beauty\nand infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of\n\nlife, which may be affected in the long course of time by nature\u2019s power of selection.\u201d!2\n\nIf humans could alter pigeons drastically, given the immensely long time at its disposal, why couldn't nature vary organic\nbeings to create the diversity we see today? It may seem blindingly obvious to us, but no naturalist had connected the artificially\n\ncreated variety of breeds of pigeons, dogs, or plants to the ubiquitous natural heterogeneity of the natural world.\n\nThe Puzzle of the Peacock\u2019s Tail\n\nDarwin\u2019s second bold conjecture in Origin was sexual selection.\n\n\u201cThe sight of a feather in a peacocks tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick,\u201d Darwin wrote.12 He felt that a male ornament\nlike the resplendent peacocks tail contradicted the theory of natural selection because it was a handicap to the peacock\u2019s survival.\nWhy would a peacock evolve to endanger its chances of a long life? Darwin concluded that the currency of natural selection is not\n\njust survival but reproduction.\n\nAny character trait that allows an animal to produce more offspring is a winner in the long run because those offspring, in\nturn, are able to produce more of themselves. A peacock with a showier tail will attract more peahens to sire more offspring over\nhis lifetime. Consequently, there would be a race for even more elaborate tails. In Origin he writes, \u201cThis form of selection depends,\n\nnot ona struggle for existence in relation to other organic beings or to external conditions, but on a struggle between the individu-\n\f"}, "001910.png": {"text": "als of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the other sex.\u201d Male peacocks struggle with each other through the beauty\n\nof their tails. The struggle is not for existence but sexual partners.\n\nDarwin also shocked his Victorian-era readers by giving agency to the females, contending, \u201cI can see no good reason to\ndoubt that female birds, by selecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious or beautiful males, according to their\nstandard of beauty, might produce a marked effect.\u201d He was claiming that the beauty of the peacock\u2019s tail was under the control of\n\nthe peahens. It was the peahens who arbitrarily decided the aesthetics of a tail.\n\nSexual selection is not limited to birds, of course. Like generations of naturalists before him, Darwin observed male stags,\ncocks, beetles, and predatory species fight aggressively over females. \u201cA hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance\nof leaving numerous offspring,\u201d he rightly pointed out. He compared male appendages like a lion\u2019s mane or the hooked jaw of a\nsalmon to a sword or spear. A stag with unwieldy horns may be easier fodder for a lion but would end up fathering many more off-\n\nspring than a stag with unimpressive horns.\n\nJust as with natural selection, Darwin formulated his theory of sexual selection by examining well-established facts ina\n\nnew light.\n\nWe Are One\n\nDarwin\u2019s third assertion of common ancestry in Origin was his most significant intellectual leap in my layperson\u2019s view.\n\nIn his words, \u201cI believe that animals have descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal\nor lesser number. Analogy would lead me one step further, namely to the belief that all animals and plants have descended from\nsome prototype.\u201d Many Victorians did not even accept that Black and White humans descended from a common stock, and here\n\nwas Darwin claiming unity across disparate species.\n\f"}, "001911.png": {"text": "Chapter 14 of Origin presents copious evidence to bolster his claim that most species have evolved from very few common\nancestors. He called this phenomenon \u201cdescent with modification.\u201d He starts by pointing out the obvious: Organic beings are\nnested within groups.!2 The hierarchy levels, in ascending order, are as follows: species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, and\nkingdom.\n\nThus, dogs are the species Canis familiaris and belong to the genus Canis. When grouped with wolves and jackals, they be-\nlong to the family Canidae. When Canidae is grouped with other families like Felidae (cats), Ursidae (bears), Mustelidae (weasels),\nand many others, we get to the order Carnivora. Carnivora brackets along Cetacea (whales and dolphins), Perissodactyla (horses,\ntapirs), Sirenia (dugongs), Lagomorpha (rabbits), and others to form the class Mammalia. Mammalia, Amphibia, and other classes\nmerge to form the phylum Chordata. Chordates, mollusks, nematodes, and numerous other phyla cluster to create the kingdom\n\nAnimalia.\n\nCarolus Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist, laid the groundwork for this classification system in 1735 in Systema Naturae (The\nSystem of Nature).2\u00b0 Naturalists had made mutually exclusive divisions before Linnaeus; his genius was to see all of life as a nested\nhierarchy. Linnaeus was a highly devout man and believed that nature\u2019s hierarchical system resulted from God\u2019s plan. Amazingly,\n\nthe modern organization of the living world follows Linnaeus\u2019s system with only a few modifications.\n\nAs you can see, there seems to be a particular natural order to this system; dogs appear rightly classified along with jackals;\nCanidae and Felidae are at the same level of family; and how else does one group horses and dugongs except under the class of\nmammals? But, as Darwin writes in chapter 14 of Origin, \u201cSome deeper bond is included in our classifications than mere resem-\nblance. I believe that this is the case, and that community of descent\u2014the one known cause of close similarity in organic beings\u2014\n\nis the bond, which though observed by various degrees of modification, is partially revealed to us by our classifications.\u201d\n\nDarwin was making a strikingly original argument. The classification system seems right to us because it reflects the path\nof evolution of all living beings on Earth. Linnaeus demonstrated that all organic life is connected.

First, the early-stage embryos of seemingly unrelated\ngroups like mammals, birds, and reptiles resemble one another so closely that it is hard to distinguish between them.

In a later stage of development, a salamander resembles a fish, and a human looks like a turtle. Why\n\nshould this be so? \u201cThus, community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent,\u201d Darwin writes.\n\nHuman Chicken Turtle Salamander Fish\n\n \n\f"}, "001913.png": {"text": "5.1 The stages of development of five species. Is there a difference among the early embryos of a fish, a turtle, and a human?\n\n \n\nSource: Licensed from istockphoto (Getty Images).\n\nSecond, he offers rudimentary organs as evidence of the kinship of ancestral and living forms. By \u201crudimentary organs,\u201d\nDarwin meant vestigial organs that persist in an organism but have lost their function. He offered many examples: mammaries\nin male mammals, fused and useless wings in beetles, gills in the land-dwelling tadpoles of the common salamander, teeth in the\nupper jaw of calves that never cut through the gums, and rudiments of hind limbs and a pelvis in boa constrictors. Darwin opined\nthat formerly functional parts might become vestigial if they aren\u2019t used. Ergo, vestigial body parts establish a direct line between\norganisms and a distant common ancestor. A tadpole that breathes on land but has useless gills should have a common ancestor\nwith waterborne animals. The hidden hind limbs in a boa constrictor unite it ancestrally with animals that have legs; fused wings\n\nin beetles show that it has descended from an ancestor that gave rise to insects with wings, and so on.\n\nDarwin was right, of course. Scientists have concluded that our last universal common ancestor (LUCA) arose somewhere\nbetween 3.5 and 4 billion years ago.2! LUCA then gave rise to the six significant kingdoms of life: animals, plants, fungi, protists,\neubacteria, and archaea. Although Darwin wasn\u2019t aware of four of these six kingdoms, I find it staggering that he still arrived at the\n\ncorrect conclusion. What a genius.\n\nInvesting as a Historical Discipline\n\nThe investment profession invites soothsayers of all kinds. Some are shady, but most are well-meaning professionals who expend\n\nenormous energy pontificating over the future. We aren\u2019t one of them.\n\nI want to clarify an important point before we march ahead. Darwin and his theories are incomparable. In my view, no scien-\n\ntist comes close to him in greatness; maybe only Einstein, but probably not even him. When I compare Darwin\u2019s scientific process\n\f"}, "001914.png": {"text": "to what we do, I do it with full knowledge that it is markedly worse than comparing a gargantuan apple with a tiny orange. In the\n\nbroad scheme of things, I think we financial investors are irrelevant to this world. Darwin wasn\u2019t.\n\nBack to the lessons from Darwin. Like Darwin:\n\n- We interpret the present only in the context of history.\n- We see the same set of historical facts as everyone else.\n\n+ We have no interest in forecasting the future.\n\nWe study the history of a business to understand its financials, assess its strategies, gauge its competitive position, and\n\nfinally assign value to it. So let\u2019s take them one by one.\n\nUnderstanding the Financials of a Business\n\nThose of you in the financial industry must have seen analyst reports. However, if you aren\u2019t a finance professional or haven't\nseen an analyst report before, here is a brief description. The brokerage firms (like JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs)\nemploy research analysts who, as the name suggests, perform detailed research on publicly listed businesses and publish reports\nfor their clients, the investors. A typical analyst report describes a company\u2019s business and financials, expresses its overall strategy\nand direction, and recommends that the clients buy, hold, or sell the business. Depending on the brokerage, the analysts use a wide\nvariety of phrases\u2014\u201cunderperform,\u201d \u201coverweight,\u201d \u201caccumulate,\u201d \u201cneutral,\u201d and other esoteric terms\u2014to make their recommen-\n\ndations. Still, their recommendations essentially fall into the buy, hold, or sell category.\n\f"}, "001915.png": {"text": "Along with business commentary, most analyst reports typically carry the profit-and-loss account and the balance sheet of\nthe latest fiscal year and financial projections for the next two to five years. In many of these reports, you will not find the finan-\ncials of the past two to three years, let alone the last five to ten years. If you are keen to know the company\u2019s revenue growth over\nthe past five years, the long-term historical trend of margins, or how ROCE and free cash flow have fluctuated over a decade, you\n\nare on your own.\n\nAs I write this, I have in my hand analyst reports from five brokerages for Tata Consultancy Services, India\u2019s largest technol-\nogy services business with a market value of about $150 billion. They all have financial projections for the next two to three years\nand actual financials for the past year. Only one provides three-year historical financials. None has a five-to-ten-year financial\nhistory.\n\nAn actual incident will illuminate the reason for this state of affairs. Three of us were visiting one of our portfolio companies\na few years ago. We met with the CEO and CFO for about an hour or so. As we were about to depart, the CFO received a call on his\nmobile phone, got visibly upset at the caller, and exclaimed, \u201cI can\u2019t say anything; the results will be out after a few weeks.\u201d It turns\n\nout that the caller was a well-known investor who was checking to see how the quarter was progressing on the revenue and profit\n\nfront.\n\nIf investors hound the company management for following quarter results, wouldn't they do the same with research ana-\nlysts? So why should the analysts bother with longer-term history? Analysts produce forecasts because their clients demand they\n\nproduce forecasts. I am sure many of them know it is a futile exercise. Here is why.\n\nLet\u2019s say I need to project the following year\u2019s financials. I will need to forecast at least ten (if not more) numbers ranging\nfrom units sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold, sales expenses, receivables, capital expenditure, and so on. Let\u2019s assume that Iam\na great guesser and that I will correctly guess each of the ten numbers with a 90 percent probability. Hence, the chance of guessing\nall ten numbers correctly for next year would be only 35 percent (0.9019). One may quibble that not all ten are independent vari-\n\nables, so we should not multiply them. True, but the number of variables is much greater than ten, and they are all at least semi-\n\f"}, "001916.png": {"text": "independent. Whichever way you evaluate the probability of guessing the next year\u2019s financials correctly, it is probably worse than\n\nguessing heads or tails after tossing a coin.\n\nBut this was only for next year. I also need to project for the following year and the year after that. How accurate do you\n\nthink my estimates will be?\n\nThe only financials we prepare are for the past decade or more. Our financial trackers have no projections. Instead, we use the\n\nsame factual financial information to which everyone else has access. Not unlike Darwin.\n\nIn developing his theories, Darwin did not have special access to any confidential data or information. The Beagle trip did\nexpose him to new lands and creatures, but he did not make any discoveries. During the five-year trip, Darwin did collect 1,529\nspecies in spirits and 3,907 samples of skin, bone, and other specimens.22 But in all my research, I did not get the sense that he had\n\nstumbled upon anything significant unknown to science.\n\nThere were occasions when experts enlightened Darwin with new facts about the specimens he had collected. For example,\nin 1845, Darwin\u2019s botanist friend Joseph Hooker identified more than 200 plant species collected by Darwin and his team on Gala-\npagos.22 About 150 of these were unique to single islands, but they were also related to plants on other islands that weren't found\nanywhere else on Earth. Some plant ancestors, like those of the birds, had accidentally arrived on Galapagos a long time ago and\n\nhad diversified into many species over time by adapting to the local environment.\n\nOrnithologists and naturalists had been observing the mating rituals of peacocks for centuries, but no one else had given\nagency to the female for selecting male feathers. Even amateur ornithologists knew that only the male birds were adorned gor-\ngeous plumage and that the diversity of size, shape, and color of feathers was truly staggering across all bird species. But no or-\n\nnithologist interpreted their observations in the light of sexual selection the way Darwin did.\nSimilarly, Linnaeus\u2019s Systema Naturae was no secret. Its botanical classification system based on male and female sexes of\nplants had built Linnaeus\u2019s reputation and fame. Linnaeus modified his sexual classification system of plants in his subsequent\n\npublication, Genera Plantarum. Genera classified plants based on what he called the \u201cnatural characters\u201d of the genera: the mor-\n\f"}, "001917.png": {"text": "phological traits of flowers and fruits. However, neither he nor anyone else could explain the source of this natural order except to\nclaim that it was God\u2019s plan. Eighty years after Linnaeus\u2019s death, Darwin finally explained this natural order by invoking his theory\n\nof common descent.\n\nAs you can see, in every case, Darwin had the same historical facts as everyone else. It was only his interpretations that were\nradically new and different. I would like to believe our approach is no different.\n\nIf we don\u2019t forecast financials, what do we do with historical numbers? A lot. As permanent owners, we are incredibly\nparanoid about the financial performance of our businesses. So here is the way we use historical financials to assess our portfolio\ncompanies.\n\nLet me take the example of Berger Paints, India\u2019s second-largest paint business. We have owned Berger since 2008. When\n\nBerger declares its quarterly results, we perform two broad historical analyses: absolute and relative.\n\nFor example, why has revenue growth declined to 10 percent over the past year compared to its longer-term average of 15 to\n16 percent? What could be the reasons for high margins for the third year in a row? Has the company started spending less than\nusual on sales and marketing? What has led to a significant decline in receivables this quarter? Is the capital expenditure over the\n\npast year higher than usual? What has driven the increase in ROCE over the last two years versus the five years before?\n\nWe don\u2019t stop at analyzing Berger\u2019s results in the context of its long-term history. As permanent owners, we want to invest\nin a business that performs well on a relative basis; that is, one that performs better than the overall competition. We compare\nBerger\u2019s quarter, last twelve months, and longer-term performance against the competition on parameters like revenue and profit\nmarket share, ROCE, and free cash flow, among many others. We track Berger primarily against four competitors: Asian Paints (the\nindustry leader), Kansai Nerolac, Akzo Nobel, and Indigo. In addition, we seek market feedback on smaller or private businesses\nthat may have started growing aggressively. This competitive analysis through the financials can lead us to ask if Berger has lost or\n\ngained market share this quarter and last year. What has driven Kansai\u2019s increased revenue share over the past two years? Who is\n\f"}, "001918.png": {"text": "gaining the most from Akzo\u2019s share loss? Has Indigo been able to expand outside Kerala? What is the trend in Berger\u2019s advertising\n\nexpenses relative to its competitors?\n\nAs you can see, there is a lot we do with historical financial information. What I have outlined here are the sample issues we\nraise for a portfolio company. The analysis is no different when evaluating a new business. We demand stellar absolute and relative\n\nfinancial performance based on any potential investment\u2019s actual financial track record.\n\nWhy fritter away time making useless forecasts with so much to do with the historical information we already have?\n\nAssessing the Strategies of a Business\n\n\u201cStrategy\u201d is a loaded word. For our purpose, let me just define it as \u201cwhatever companies do to achieve their goals under condi-\ntions of uncertainty.\u201d Purists will quibble on the definition of \u201ctactics\u201d versus \u201cstrategy.\u201d Let them. As folks investing real money,\n\n\u2018we can move on to more practical problems.\n\nBy now, I assume you can \u201cpredict\u201d what I am about to write! Yes, we assess historical strategies to understand businesses.\nAsmall sample of strategic issues we focus on: Which customer segments have you targeted? How have your products or services\nserved the needs of customers? In what ways have you been different from the competition? How have you allocated capital his-\n\ntorically? What has been your capital structure, and why?\n\nTwo things may be evident to you as you read these questions: They are about the company\u2019s strategic steps in the past, and\nthese are issues that even a first-year undergrad could raise. What\u2019s so great about these questions? Nothing. We ask these ques-\ntions not to evaluate the answers objectively but to subjectively assess if they fit our preexisting hypotheses of success or failure. Yes,\n\nwe know the answer we want before we have asked the first question.\n\f"}, "001919.png": {"text": "If we have done a decent job over many years, it is not a result of asking these mundane questions but because our under-\nlying bias demands the answers fit our template. We have our templates for success and failure, and we aim to assess if the com-\n\npany\u2019s strategy fits a pattern. Very few do\u2014more on this in chapter 6.\n\nThis approach is not very different from Darwin's, who famously wrote in a letter to one Henry Fawcett in 1861, \u201cHow odd it\nis that everyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service.\u201d24 Darwin's unique\n\nability was to assess objective information\u2014available to everyone\u2014in the light of his subjective hypothesis.\n\nTake his view on why there should be a struggle for existence. In 1798, Thomas Malthus, an English economist, published an\nessay on the principle of population growth.2: Malthus argued that the human population increases exponentially, whereas food\nresources grow linearly, so human prosperity will be impossible unless there are strict limits on reproduction. Further, Malthus\nwrote that unless humans started having fewer children, the inevitable food shortage would curse humanity to an eternal strug-\n\ngle for existence\u2014only famine, war, and disease would check population growth. It was a dark and pessimistic view of humanity.\n\nDarwin read Malthus\u2019s essay in 1838, and he extended the domain of applicability of Malthus\u2019s principle to the entire living\nworld.2s No one had done this before. I can\u2019t do better than the master\u2019s own words: \u201cEvery being, which during its natural life-\ntime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer destruction during some period of its life, and during some season or occasional\nyear[;] otherwise, on the principle of geometric increase, its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that no country\ncould support the product. Hence, as more individuals are produced than can survive, there must in every case be a struggle for\nexistence. Either one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or with the physical\n\nconditions of life.\u201d\n\nLike everyone around him, Darwin saw that no animal or plant species dominated our planet, although many produced\nhundreds or thousands of seeds or offspring. However, no one else interpreted history the way he did. With Malthus\u2019s inspiration,\nhe explained the current state of the organic world by invoking the hypothesis of the unimaginable historical destruction and an-\n\nnihilation of organisms. His observations fit the template of the struggle for existence.\n\f"}, "001920.png": {"text": "There is probably no better way to explain this than with a real example from the world of investing. We are shareholders in\nacompany called NRB Bearings. Its owner and CEO, Harshbeena Zaveri, is an anthropology graduate from Wellesley. She is proba-\nbly the best strategic thinker in our portfolio. NRB manufactures needle roller bearings for the automotive industry and has about\n65 to 70 percent market share in India. The global giant Schaeffler accounts for the rest. Bearings account for just 1 to 2 percent of\nthe cost of a vehicle but are critical components\u2014failure can lead to severe accidents.\n\nWe avoid the automotive component space because, in general, its clients, the automotive companies, do not allow them to\nmake money. In the United States, for example, the top five car companies controlled about two-thirds of the market in 2021.22\nThis concentration allows them to drive a tough bargain with their suppliers: the automotive component companies. Unsurpris-\ningly, not many parts suppliers can consistently earn a decent profit. India is even more consolidated than the United States\u2014the\ndominant car company, Maruti Suzuki, controls half the Indian market. The Indian motorcycle market is an oligopoly of just three\ncompanies. It is not unusual for a parts supplier to have a huge customer concentration\u2014a top customer typically accounts for 30\nto 50 percent of revenues.\n\nHence, our bias is to reject almost every automotive component business. There can be an exception, though. But that\nexception must fit the following template. First, the parts supplier would need to manufacture a critical component requiring pro-\nprietary technology and have a low customer concentration over many years. It should have only one or two competitors, and the\ncompetitive dynamics in the industry should be stable over the long term. Finally, there should have been no new entrants to the\nindustry for many years, and the company should have delivered good financials historically. Note that not a single criterion here\nis about the future.\n\nNRB ticked every box, and so when the company valuation came to the level we liked, we swooped in to buy 10 percent of the\n\nbusiness.

This joke will make it more straightforward. When two friends hiking in a forest spot a lion, one starts putting on his running\nshoes. His friend says, \u201cWhat are you doing that for? You can\u2019t possibly outrun a lion.\u201d The man replies, \u201cI know, but I need only to\nrun faster than you, not the lion!\u201d\n\nWe humans do not possess an ideal body or brain design, as those with back pain, hernias, or the desire to make leveraged\ncrypto trades will confess. But as a species, we were undoubtedly better than tens of other sister species in the Homo genus, and\n\nthat has allowed more than eight billion of us to rule the world.\n\nInvestors, analysts, and academics have beaten the term \u201csustainable competitive advantage\u201d to death. Still, as in evolu-\ntionary theory, the real question is not just about sustainable competitive advantage but about being consistently better than the\ncompetition. And what is the meaning of \u201cbetter\u201d? For us, it relates to measurable parameters like ROCE, market share, free cash\n\nflow, balance sheet strength, consistency of financials, and other such measures.\n\nWe assess all these historically. So the question for us is never, \u201cWill you be better than the competition,\u201d but \u201cHave you con-\nsistently been better than the competition?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s pick market share as an example. If a company is consistently losing market share, and if SoftBank, Tiger, Alibaba, or\nNaspers has not offered a billion dollars to its competitors so they can burn cash mindlessly, no one can convince me that the com-\npany has a sustainable competitive advantage. On the other hand, if a company is consistently gaining market share, isn\u2019t it highly\nlikely that they have built a defensible moat? We want our businesses to gain market share over the long term, recognizing full\n\nwell that the trend line may occasionally reverse in the short term.\n\nIn this context, it may be informative to share one of my early mistakes in the fund with you.

I had erred in sizing up the competitive advantage of the business.\n\nThe company had performed reasonably well in the past few years, but it had lost significant market share over the long\nterm. The two most prominent players in the industry, founded around the same time as this company, were more than twenty\ntimes the revenue of this business.

The company had been performing\nwell recently, but, with a longer-term lens, I should have seen that the company was a chronic underperformer. Moreover, the\nsame team of founder-managers had been running the business since its inception.

He wanted to know how our portfolio was performing, and\nI started complaining mildly about the high valuation of our businesses. I wanted to buy more of these companies, but the prices\nseemed to have run up a lot. My friend was surprised and countered that the valuations weren't too high. They seemed reasonable.\n\nI would say, \u201cCompany A is at 45 PE [price/earnings ratio],\u201d and he would counter, \u201cNo, it\u2019s only 25 PE.\u201d I would then complain\n\f"}, "001923.png": {"text": "about Company Y being 55 PE, and he would appear surprised and correct me that the PE for the company was only 28. 1 was now\n\nfrustrated, and he appeared pretty surprised\u2014did I not know the valuation of my businesses?\nAnd then it struck me.\n\nWhen I said 45 PE, I meant to say 45 times trailing PE. When he said 25 PE, he meant 25 times forward PE. His forward PE\nwas not for the next year but for two years later! For those unfamiliar with our industry\u2019s terminology, I had valued our business\nbased on the actual delivered earnings of the past year. On the other hand, my friend had taken the average industry estimates of\n\ncompany earnings two years in the future and calculated the PE based on these forecasted earnings.\n\nThe following example will make this clearer. Let\u2019s say that the profit after tax of a company in the past twelve months is $10\nmillion and that its market value is $450 million. This gives a trailing PE of 45 (450 = 10). If the consensus analyst estimates are\nthat the company\u2019s earnings will be $14 million next year and $18 million the year after that, the one-year forward PE for the same\n\nbusiness will be 32 (450 + 14), and the two-year forward PE will be 25 (450 +18).\n\nWhich of these three\u201445, 32, or 25\u2014is the correct PE? It depends on the investor. For us, it is the backward-looking 45, and\nfor my friend, it is the forward-looking 25. Most discussions of PE or other valuation ratios (like price/book or enterprise value/\nEBITDA) are forward-looking. The only PE ratio we discuss relates to the delivered earnings of the past. It may be the previous\ntwelve months or the past three years, or, for some highly cyclical businesses, even the past ten-year average PE (i.e., current mar-\nket value divided by the average earnings of the past ten years). We also use other valuation metrics, but all value the current busi-\nness based on its past performance.\n\nIcan understand if some investors project earnings over one or two years since that\u2019s not too far in the future. It\u2019s not ideal,\n\nbut I get it. What I fail to fathom is why investors do something worse. Much worse.\nIt\u2019s called discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.\n\nHere is a simple way to understand it. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s the year 2000, and your mom promises to give you $100 a year for the\n\nnext two years. You need the cash urgently, and you ask Mom to give you the cash today instead. She will not give you $200 since\n\f"}, "001924.png": {"text": "the value of $100 in 2001 and 2002 is lower than in 2000 (yes, Mom isa stickler and a good mathematician). How much money\n\nshould she give you? You will need a DCF analysis to arrive at the answer.\n\nFor this, you will need a discount rate or cost of capital.22 Mom decides that it should be 5 percent (maybe because this is the\nbank interest rate). Thus, the value of $100 in 2001 is $95 in 2000 ($100 = 1.05). The value of $100 in 2002 is $91 in 2000 ($100 +\n1.052). Thus, if you choose to take all the money today, she should give you $186 ($95 + $91). This is a simple DCF analysis.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nThe problem starts when you replace your mom with a company. Whoa! Did I just say that? But you know what I mean. If\nyou don\u2019t, let me elaborate. As per corporate finance theory, the value of a business is simply the sum of all its future cash flows\ndiscounted to the present time. This makes academic sense. It\u2019s true mathematically. But as a practical way to invest, it borders on\nbeing nonsensical. Let\u2019s understand why. There are two main requirements for building a DCF spreadsheet: the discount rate and\nthe cash flow projection.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the discount rate.\n\nThe discount rate is the weighted average costs of debt and equity; it is equivalent to the 5 percent we used in the example\nwith your mom. I understand the cost of debt, but what is the cost of equity? Corporate finance theory comes to the rescue and\nprovides a clean-cut official formula. The formula is as follows: (risk-free rate) + B x (expected market return - risk-free rate). Looks\n\nneat, right? Just plug in the numbers to get the answer. Don\u2019t be fooled, though; it hides several vast issues.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the Greek letter 8 (beta), which indicates riskiness. It measures the volatility of a stock relative to the mar-\nket. Thus, a stock that moves in perfect synchrony with the market will have a B of 1. But, again, isn\u2019t the notion of measuring risk\nby using volatility as a proxy quite silly? As I discussed in chapter 1, how does riskiness have anything to do with volatility? For\nan investor, the riskiness of a business is directly proportional to the probability of capital loss of investing in that business. The\n\nhigher the potential loss, the higher the risk. I don\u2019t care about B and never will.\n\f"}, "001925.png": {"text": "As you can see in the formula, we need a number for the expected market return. Ask ten experts, and you will get ten differ-\nent answers for expected market return. What number should I pick? Average, median, whatever I like? The formula has no advice\n\nto offer.\n\nDo you see anything in the formula about how much debt the company is carrying? Do you think a company with a consid-\nerable debt load should have the same cost of equity as a company with no debt? The formula does not believe so. It is bizarre and\nalmost laughable. Distressed companies with high leverage get sold for a pittance because the equity investors demand a high cost\nof equity.\n\nAs if all this is not enough, let\u2019s look at the damaging impact of pretending that an impressive-looking math formula will\n\nprotect us from egregious errors.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to your mom. If she decides to discount cash flow by 7 percent instead of 5 percent, she will give you only $181,\nnot $186. But if she discounts at 3 percent, you will receive $5 extra, or $191. A DCF analysis assumes cash flows in perpetuity, and\nso the present value of this formulation is much more sensitive to the discount rate than the one used by your mom. For example,\nassume that a cash flow of $100 grows by 10 percent over twenty-five years. Using a discount rate of 10 percent, the discounted\npresent value of this series is $2,273.

Trust me; you will get\nindigestion.\n\nEven if you aren't from the financial community, you may have read or heard of the stock prices of individual companies\nsuddenly dropping or increasing massively. Let\u2019s take the example of Snapchat, an app that every teenager with a smartphone\nseems to be using.22 In early May 2017, Snapchat\u2019s share price dropped almost 25 percent in a single day after the company declared\nfinancial results that showed slower growth than expected and a massive loss of $2.2 billion. There was a lot of public information\navailable on the company, and since Snapchat had listed only recently, investors and analysts had analyzed its future cash flows in\n\ngory detail. They had not foreseen the abysmal financial results.\n\nIf investors can\u2019t forecast cash flows even a few days or months in advance, how can they be expected to project cash flows\nyears ahead? But this is what the DCF methodology demands. Investors and analysts rarely fail to build massive, complicated\n\nfinancial models that assess dozens of factors to project cash flows over many years in the future. Hail Excel.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the builders of these Excel models\u2014whether analysts, bankers, consultants, or investors\u2014are unaware of the\npitfalls. But for some reason, the deep desire to look far in the future to arrive at an exact number overwhelms the rational voice ad-\n\nmonishing the person to stop pretending they are doing anything useful.\n\nOne of the best ways for you to get a sense of this future obsession is to read the transcripts of a company\u2019s quarterly results\nconference calls. Most companies post such transcripts in their websites\u2019 \u201cInvestor Relations\u201d section. I analyzed three conference\ncall transcripts\u2014for Walmart (for Q2 2018), P&G (for Q4 2017), and General Motors (for Q2 2017)\u2014and the results are stark.\n\nFor Walmart, analysts and investors focused twenty-eight out of forty-nine questions on the future (e.g., \u201cimplied EBIT\nmargin direction within the guidance\u201d). On the P&G call, fourteen out of twenty questions asked the management to make some\n\nkind of prediction (e.g., \u201cDo you have more initiatives hitting the market?\u201d).

Knowing full well that the future is in-\n\nherently unpredictable, the latter attempts to sidestep the question with some broad generic comments.\n\nFor example, on the General Motors call for Q2 2017, an analyst wanted to know the revenue projection for OnStar, an\nadvanced communication system installed in GM cars. The answer from the CFO was, \u201cAs we have talked about before, yes, OnStar\nis generating revenue. We don\u2019t disclose it separately. It continues to grow.\u201d My sympathies lie with company management; they\nknow that they don\u2019t know what the future will bring. But, on the other hand, most analysts and fund managers, having never\nworked in a company, think that it is the management\u2019s job to know the future; how else how will they be able to populate their\nDCF models?\n\nI have been on the boards of more than twenty-five companies, and over the years I have never seen a management team\nmeet its budgets. Some exceed their projections, and some undershoot. Occasionally, the over- or underperformance is by a\nwide margin. If the company management can\u2019t forecast correctly, how can investors do so? They can\u2019t. More importantly, they\nshouldn't try.\n\nWe have never done a DCF analysis and never will. However, I know many\u2014if not most\u2014investors and analysts do. Maybe\nthey have figured out a method to look far into the future that eludes me. In any event, our approach is straightforward.\n\nLet me take the example of a noncyclical business growing at a moderate pace. We know the market-trailing PE multiple is\nabout 19 or 20. We pay a multiple at or below the market for an exceptional business with high ROCE, a wide moat, and low busi-\nness and financial risk. Occasionally, we stretch a bit by paying a trailing multiple in the high teens or low 20s for a truly unique\nbusiness, but these occasions are few and far between. The median trailing PE multiple for our portfolio when we bought the com-\n\npanies is 14.9.\n\f"}, "001928.png": {"text": "We refine this method for cyclical businesses and those that haven\u2019t shown steady growth in earnings (e.g., if earnings\nstayed flat for the previous five years or doubled in the past year).

When evaluating a business, risk comes first, quality\n\nsecond, and valuation last.\n\nWhat Is Necessary Need Not Be Sufficient\n\nIn the words of Douglas Futuyma, a professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, \u201cThe core of evolutionary biology\nconsists of describing and analyzing the history of evolution, and of analyzing the causes and mechanisms of evolution.\u201d22 As a\n\nresult, the natural world throws up several questions that we can\u2019t answer without drawing inferences about historical processes.\nFor example, why do females fight over males in some species? Why are there two sexes and not five? Why does only a tiny part of\n\nour genome code for proteins? Why do lions commit infanticide? How did birds evolve from dinosaurs?\n\nAs long-term investors, we have dissociated ourselves from the \u201cwhat will happen?\u201d obsession and replaced it with \u201cwhat\nhas actually happened?\u201d The former is a laundry list of conjectures and opinions, and the latter, to a large extent, consists of facts.\nOf course, facts in and of themselves are empty, and what matters is the opinions we build onto those facts, but at least they give us\n\na foundation for a discussion.\n\nFor example, if a company has had a historical ROCE over the past decade of 40 percent, two investors could have widely\ndifferent opinions of this \u201cfact.\u201d One could assert that the company has a great future, and the other could argue that microe-\nconomic theory demands that these returns will be competed away. Understanding that the company has had unusually high\nreturns in the past focuses the investors\u2019 attention on the sources of these returns and their sustainability. For example, did the\n\ncompany earn these returns because of regulatory protection from overseas competition, and, if so, are we comfortable backing a\n\f"}, "001929.png": {"text": "business that has not faced genuine competition? Or were these returns earned despite fierce competition? What has the company\n\ndone relative to the competition that has made it so unique?\n\nOur focus on interpreting the present in the context of history is not free of problems. Let me share two categories of issues.\nBoth relate to the issue of necessity versus sufficiency of track record.\n\nThe once-famous company Nokia exemplifies the first category of issues. Nokia was a high-flying company in the late 1990s\nand dominated the mobile phone market in the same way that the iPhone does today.2! Large emerging markets like China and\nIndia were severely underpenetrated in the mobile phone sector in the 1990s. Based on historical performance, it appeared that\nNokia would conquer the world.\n\nInvestors couldn\u2019t buy enough Nokia stock, and, at its peak in the year 2000, Nokia\u2019s market value was about $325 billion.\nSince then, it has lost more than 90 percent of its value. In the year 2000, all the historical signals from the company\u2014its financial\nperformance, competitive position, reputation, and dealer and customer feedback\u2014would have screamed, \u201cThis is an amazing\ncompany.\u201d But Nokia could not compete with Apple, Samsung, or tens of local Chinese and Indian competitors over the next\ndecade, and the Nokia phone is now a museum relic.\n\nAnyone relying only on the history of Nokia would have suffered massive losses. Giving weight to a track record is a neces-\nsary condition for investment success, but it is in no way sufficient. We find this to be especially true in fast-changing industries\nthat may or may not be technology related. Thus, in the case of Nokia, while most historical signals would have led one to conclude\nthat the company had been truly outstanding, the very nature of the technology industry, in which rapid change is the norm,\nshould have made any investor pause.\n\nWe have avoided fast-changing industries like the plague, and many are not even in the technology space. Industries like\nretailing, microfinance, food delivery, and e-commerce are in the early stages of evolution in India. There is way too much turmoil\n\nin these industries for us to feel comfortable using only historical information to invest.\n\f"}, "001930.png": {"text": "Should an investor avoid technology companies and other rapidly evolving industries?

When encountering a Nokia-like business, I\n\nam very comfortable saying, \u201cI can\u2019t figure this out, so thanks, but no thanks.\u201d\n\u2018We can summarize the second problem of historical analysis in one word: Starbucks.\n\nIn this case, relying on history would not have helped us identify a spectacular turnaround, thereby depriving us of poten-\ntially a substantial money-making opportunity. Howard Schultz bought Starbucks in 1982, and from a mere four stores in Seattle,\nhe grew it to about $2 billion in revenue by 2000. Unfortunately, he left Starbucks in 2000 owing to exhaustion, and not long after,\n\nStarbucks started underperforming.\n\nWhen Schultz returned to the company in 2008, there was bad news all around.22 Sales had been flagging for some time.\nMcDonald\u2019s and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts had dramatically increased pressure on the company by launching their own gourmet coffee\nbrands. As a result, the stock price had fallen by almost half over the previous year. From 2008, Schultz led a dramatic turnaround\nin Starbucks\u2019 fortunes by cutting back on expansion, closing hundreds of stores, creating a new instant coffee brand, and refocus-\ning on the consumer. Investors fell in love with the company again\u2014the stock price jumped more than eighteen-fold from Decem-\n\nber 2008 to December 2019.\n\nLet\u2019s take ourselves back to 2008 when everything seemed to be falling apart at Starbucks. All the historical signals\u2014\ncustomer feedback, market share, same-store sales growth\u2014pointed to a company struggling to regain its lost glory. Schultz may\nhave been the CEO eight years previously, but the company had changed a lot since then; there were thousands of new stores, the\nmanagement was different, and customer and competitor behavior were different, too. Schultz may have revived the company,\nbut there is no evidence that founders are the best turnaround artists. In 2008, given the lack of historical data pointing to a turn-\n\naround, I would not have invested in the company and lost out on a huge potential gain.\n\f"}, "001931.png": {"text": "What is the solution?

However, I doubt even\n\nthe best private schools had someone like the incredible Mr. Rathod.\n\nWe had recently arrived in a small town called Jamnagar when I was in grade 7. I was miserable because I had to bid farewell\nto my friends in the previous town (called Dehu Road), and I found it hard to fit in socially at this new school. However, Mr. Rathod\nand his history class got me through that year. He refused to teach us history from the prescribed textbook. Instead, he ordered\nus to use the school library to read about ancient and modern Indian history from books and popular comics. And then he asked\neach student to pick a topic and educate the class on what they had learned.

All the Caribbean species are the descendants of just two species that arrived from the mainland millions of years ago. Dr.\nJonathan Losos, a professor of biology at Washington University, has been studying the anoles since the late 1980s on the four\nlarger Caribbean islands of Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico.\n\nProfessor Losos discovered that the one hundred and fifty species across these four islands are broadly clustered into six\ngroups, or \u201cecomorphs\u201d: Trunk, Twig, Crown-giant, Trunk-crown, Trunk-ground, and Grass-bush. This classification rests on\nbody length, tail length, limb length, toe pad lamellae (scales on the feet of the anoles that help them stick to a surface), color, and\n\nhabitat.\n\f"}, "001937.png": {"text": "For example, the Trunk ecomorph lives on tree trunks, has an average body length of about five centimeters, has a short tail,\nand is gray. A very different ecomorph, the Grass-bush, lives in the grasses and bush, has an average body length of four centime-\nters, has a very long tail, and is brown.\n\nThe behavioral and physical traits of various anole ecomorphs have adapted very well to the anoles\u2019 unique local environ-\nments. Thus, the long tail of the Grass-bush ecomorph helps the anole achieve spectacular balance on narrow and unstable sur-\nfaces like blades of grass, and its brown color melds with the color of the bush and grasses. The Trunk ecomorph is very different\nbecause it has a solid tree trunk underneath its feet for most of its life\u2014it does not need a long tail for balance. But it does need its\ngray color, which can provide camouflage against the gray tree trunk, thereby fooling its predators and prey. The Twig anole has\nshort legs to help it navigate the small twigs on which it lives. Finally, the Trunk-ground ecomorph has evolved long legs to run\n\nefficiently on tree trunks and the ground.\nNo surprises here\u2014Darwinian natural selection is alive and well on the gorgeous islands of the Caribbean.\n\nWhat is surprising, however, is that the same ecomorphs are seen across the four islands. Thus, the Trunk ecomorph in Cuba\nlooks and behaves very similarly to the Trunk ecomorph in Hispaniola, and the Crown-giant ecomorph in Puerto Rico is indistin-\nguishable from the one in Jamaica.\n\nI know what you are thinking: Are the Trunk anoles the same species that colonized Cuba and Hispaniola? DNA analysis has\ndemonstrated that they aren't! The six ecomorph anoles on the island of Cuba are much more closely related to one another than\nthey are to anoles on other islands. Thus, the Trunk anoles in Cuba are much more closely related to the Twig anoles in Cuba than\nto the Trunk anoles in Hispaniola. The anoles living on tree trunks on the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola are very different species\nbut have developed the same physical and behavioral characteristics on encountering similar environments. This is true for all six\necomorphs. When presented with a specific problem, the Caribbean anoles on different islands have evolved the same solutions,\n\nsuch as tail length, body length, and color.

All four plants produce the\n\nsame chemical desired by humans: a purine alkaloid called 1,3,7-trimethylpurine-2,6-dione\u2014in short, caffeine.2\n\nThese four plants may seem to be closely related, but they aren\u2019t. The common ancestor of tea and coffee dates back a\nhundred million years. Cacao is more closely related to maple and eucalyptus trees than to tea and coffee. Bizarrely, the ancestor of\ncoffee gave rise to potatoes and tomatoes but not tea! Plants have many defense mechanisms against predators, and it appears that\n\nsome have converged toward the same solution: producing caffeine.\n\nMany plants rely on birds to pollinate their flowers. So if a plant depends on hummingbirds for pollination, what should it\ndo? Develop red flowers because red is attractive to hummingbirds. Consequently, eighteen types of plants that hummingbirds\npollinate have evolved bright red flowers.\n\nOther plants have developed a different strategy, one that exploits flies\u2019 and beetles\u2019 penchant for laying eggs on smelly\n\ndecomposing carcasses. Seven types of plants\u2014including the corpse lily and the Zulu giant (or carrion flower)\u2014have evolved to\n\f"}, "001942.png": {"text": "produce a smell that resembles rotting meat. The odor fools the insects, and while visiting the plants to lay their eggs, they transfer\npollen from one flower to another.12\n\nI could go on and on to fill this book with examples of convergent evolution in the natural world. But scientists now agree\nthat convergence is the rule, not an exception, in nature. This sentiment is best expressed by the most famous advocate of con-\nvergence, the Cambridge paleontologist Simon Conway Morris, who has written two books on the subject. He has explained.\nconvergence by saying, \u201cCertainly it\u2019s not the case that every Earth-like planet will have life let alone humanoids. But if you want\na sophisticated plant, it will look awfully like a flower. If you want a fly, there are only a few ways you can do that. If you want to\nswim, like a shark, there are only a few ways you can do that. If you want to invent warm-bloodedness, like birds and mammals,\nthere are only a few ways to do that.\u201d\n\nConvergence in nature symbolizes a profound fact: There is a pattern to success and failure.\n\nWhat can the Caribbean anole, the crest-tailed marsupial mouse, and caffeine teach us about investing?\n\nConvergence in business symbolizes a profound fact: There is a pattern to success and failure.\n\nWe Don't Invest in Individual Businesses\n\nEarlier in the chapter, I made the following assertion about our investment strategy: We don\u2019t invest in individual businesses. It may\n\nseem like we do, but we don\u2019t.\nSo what in the world do we invest in then?\n\nWe invest in convergent patterns. We seek patterns that repeat. As we saw, \u201creplaying the tape of life\u201d often yields the same\n\nresult. We operate on the principle that the business world is no different. There is a big difference between asserting \u201cI love this\n\f"}, "001943.png": {"text": "business\u201d and \u201cI love this business construct.\u201d We are fans of the latter, not the former. We don\u2019t care about a business; we are\n\ndeeply attached to a business template.\n\nNot unlike the natural world, which converges toward a small subset of answers to the same questions, we have seen that\ncompanies around the globe behave in similar ways when facing a similar environment. Not always, but often enough. We have\n\nbenefited enormously by asking this simple convergence question up front: \u201cHave we seen this pattern elsewhere?\u201d\nThe cost of ignoring patterns, as usual, is best demonstrated through a painful personal experience.\n\nIn 1999 or 2000, an investment bank showed us a \u201chot\u201d private equity deal. There was a lot of interest from many investors\n(or so the bank led us to believe!). The company processed credit cards and had shown modest growth over the past few years. Un-\nsurprisingly, the investment bank\u2019s projections showed dramatic growth starting the following year. Skeptical initially, I met the\nmanagement team and talked to industry participants and investors in the business. Then, after reviewing India\u2019s low credit card\npenetration rates, I convinced myself that while the management\u2019s and the bank\u2019s projections were aggressive, they weren't too far\n\noff the mark. So we invested in the business at a fancy valuation.\n\nI wasn\u2019t wrong. I was catastrophically wrong. The company did not meet its projections for more than five years. The J-curve\ngrowth never arrived. I want to emphasize that this was neither the bank\u2019s nor the management\u2019s fault. They were doing their job.\n\nBut, unfortunately, I forgot to do mine.\n\nA few years after this disaster, when I looked back at the projections, I realized that we would have saved our precious capital\nif I had applied the principle of convergence by asking a few simple questions. The questions I should have asked but did not were\nas follows: \u201cSure, credit card penetration is low in India, but so is penetration for every consumer product. What other consumer\nproducts in India have seen these growth rates over the long term? Do you have examples of other countries where we have seen\nsuch rapid credit card growth? If so, was their stage of development similar to India\u2019s today?\u201d I should have demanded a conver-\n\ngent template, but I didn\u2019t.\n\f"}, "001944.png": {"text": "Let\u2019s see what happens when we do. We invested in Info Edge in late 2013. It runs India\u2019s leading job site, Naukri.com, and is\nled by Sanjeev Bikhchandani and Hitesh Oberoi, two of the most well-regarded entrepreneurs in India. We did not invest in Naukri\n\nbecause of Sanjeev and Hitesh but because of the convergent patterns Naukri represents.\n\nNaukri allows job-seeking candidates to post their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for free and charges companies a subscription fee to access these\nand list job vacancies. When we invested in 2013, Naukri had a dominant 65 percent traffic share and was four times larger than\nthe second player, Monster India. Given Naukri\u2019s dominance, if you are a job seeker in India, you would almost certainly post your\nr\u00e9sum\u00e9 there. If you are a company trying to hire, you are almost compelled to subscribe to Naukri because it has the most exten-\n\nsive and diverse pool of candidates. It is emblematic of the classic network effect: Naukri is number one because it is number one.\n\nOur confidence in Info Edge was high because it represents not one but two convergent patterns. First, the erstwhile Yellow\nPages business. Many of you have probably never heard of this life-saving invention, but they were my lifeline until the early\n1990s. Yellow Pages were a fixture in every home, just like a television or a refrigerator, in the era of rotary landline phones before\nthe age of the internet and mobile phones. Yellow Pages were ungainly, thick telephone directories usually printed on yellow paper\n\nthat listed local businesses and their goods or services on offer.\n\nYellow Pages could give you a list of tens, even hundreds, of options, whether you were looking for a language teacher, a\nplumber, a wedding planner, a car dealer, or a recording studio. The directory was distributed free to the consumers, and busi-\nnesses paid a fee to be listed. As a result, the largest Yellow Pages business in any city or region was usually highly profitable be-\ncause of the virtual monopoly enjoyed by their network effect: Consumers went to them because they listed the largest number of\nbusinesses, and businesses subscribed to them because they attracted the largest number of consumers.\n\nThey were highly defensible businesses, and for the leading companies, the network effect ensured high profits over long\nperiods. It was not unusual for leading Yellow Pages businesses to earn a profit margin in excess of 40 percent. While Naukri op-\nerates in a different era in a different medium, our view was that it converged with many of the virtuous traits of a leading Yellow\n\nPages business.\n\f"}, "001945.png": {"text": "The second convergent pattern we noted was the performance of the leading internet job boards in other countries. This\npattern was even more powerful than that of Yellow Pages. We found at least seven other job boards globally with obscenely high\noperating margins (more than 30 to 40 percent) and infinite ROCE, just like Naukri; for example, Seek in Australia, Dice and Career-\nBuilder in the United States, 5 1Job in China, EN in Japan, 104 Corp in Taiwan, and JobStreet in Singapore and Malaysia. These dom-\ninant franchises became more dominant each year. Their margin and return profile kept improving; they were all cash machines;\nthe number two in any of these markets showed no signs of catching up; and LinkedIn and offline competitors had no impact on\nthem. In other words, they were indistinguishable from Naukri.\n\nWhen we first encountered a 49 percent operating margin and infinite ROCE for Naukri, we were skeptical. Who earns that\nkind of money? But after studying the Yellow Pages and companies in other markets, we concluded that this was no fluke. In 2021,\nNaukri\u2019s operating margin was 55 percent.\n\nWe invested in Naukri not just because Sanjeev and Hitesh are impressive folks (which they are), or because Naukri makes\ngobs of money (which it does), or because it has annihilated the competition (which it has). Instead, we invested in Naukri because\nthe convergent models of Yellow Pages and global job board businesses gave us the confidence to believe that the Naukri template is\ntough to beat. Make that almost impossible to beat.\n\nI will state two counterfactuals to highlight the importance of this method of investing. First, what if Sanjeev and Hitesh,\nimpressive as they are, were operating the number 2 or 3 job board in India? We would not have touched the business. Winner\ntakes all in the classifieds business, and we would never have bet against that pattern. Second, what if Sanjeev and Hitesh had\ncome to us in the early days of the internet when there was no proof of concept for this business model? Again, we would have\n\nwalked away because the answer to the question \u201cWhere else has this worked?\u201d would have been \u201cNo idea.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, some venture capitalists did fund Naukri in its early days. Kudos to them. They recognized the genius of San-\n\njeev and Hitesh and deserved their mouthwatering returns.\n\f"}, "001946.png": {"text": "We detest the phrases \u201cThis time, it\u2019s different\u201d and \u201cMy gut tells me this will work.\u201d We need to see the evidence that our\ninvestment thesis has worked elsewhere. If it hasn\u2019t, we are unlikely to touch it. We are the antithesis of the venture capital com-\nmunity, which earns its living by betting on untested and unproven businesses. I am in awe of successful venture capital firms, but\n\nmy admiration for them will never translate into a desire to emulate them.\n\nKahneman\u2019s Outside View and Convergence\n\nIhave learned to invest by investing and by observing other investors. I wish I could have learned from the learned finance and\neconomics academics. Have you tried reading a finance journal or research article on economics or finance? I have, and I must\nadmit I can\u2019t understand most of them. They are inundated with Greek symbols, complicated mathematical equations, and eso-\nteric arguments. They leave me baffled as to their utility for actual practitioners like me. But occasionally, one of the intellectuals\nwill take my breath away.\n\nDaniel Kahneman is one such individual. His masterpiece Thinking, Fast and Slow should be compulsory reading for all\ninvesting 101 classes. If you are already an investor, there is no more valuable chapter to read (and re-read) than chapter 23, \u201cThe\nOutside View.\u201d\n\nHere, Kahneman describes his experience of leading a team in Israel designing a curriculum and writing a textbook for high\nschool students on judgment and decision-making. After a year, the team had made reasonable progress. They had prepared a de-\ntailed outline of the syllabus, written a couple chapters, and conducted some classroom lessons.\n\nOne day, Kahneman asked his colleagues to write down an estimate of the time it would take the team to submit a finished\ntextbook draft to the Ministry of Education. Everyone on the team, including Kahneman\u2019s colleague Seymour Fox, an expert in\n\ncurriculum development, estimated that it would take them about two years. Kahneman then asked Fox, who had witnessed\n\f"}, "001947.png": {"text": "many other teams develop similar textbooks and curricula over the years, how long it usually takes teams to finish their textbook\nprojects.\n\nFox\u2019s answer stunned Kahneman. Seemingly embarrassed, Fox admitted that 40 percent of such teams never finished the\ntask, and those who did took anywhere from seven to ten years. The actual time it took Kahneman\u2019s team? Eight years. A far cry\nfrom the two years they had estimated.\n\nKahneman labels the team\u2019s initial estimate of two years the \u201cinside view.\u201d It was based on the team members\u2019 specific cir-\ncumstances, their confidence in their abilities, an extrapolation based on recent goals achieved, and a hazy idea of the future. And\nit was wrong by a wide margin.\n\nKahneman calls the 40 percent failure estimate of similar projects and the completion time of seven to ten years the \u201coutside\nview.\u201d As he describes, his questioning of Fox revealed two great insights. First, although Fox was aware of the outside view, he did\nnot even consider it while initially writing down his estimate. And second, although the other team members, including Kahne-\n\nman, did not have access to the information Fox did, none even attempted to understand the outside view when the project began.\n\nBut applying convergent thinking or an outside view is neither natural nor easy. As Kahneman himself states succinctly,\n\u201cPallid\u2019 statistical information is routinely discarded when it is incompatible with one\u2019s personal impression of a case. In the com-\n\npetition with the inside view, the outside view does not stand a chance.\u201d\n\nThe outside view does not have a chance in the investment community because, ironically, fund managers and analysts\nare savvy. Given a choice between applying their intellectual horsepower to a single business by making a ten-year projection of\nprofits or stepping back and asking if any of it even makes sense, brilliant folks often choose the former. As I was transitioning\nfrom consulting in my early investing days, I was the biggest believer in the myth that more work produces better answers for in-\n\nvestors. It doesn\u2019t.\n\nLet me illustrate the power of Kahneman\u2019s outside view by outlining two ways of analyzing a potential investment in an\n\nairline.\n\f"}, "001948.png": {"text": "Imagine that I have just flown to Singapore from New York aboard the tiber-comfortable A380 in January 2019. Ihave\nthoroughly enjoyed the legendary Singapore Airlines service. After I land, I pick up a financial newspaper and read an interesting\narticle on the enormous potential for airlines in Asia, particularly in India and China. This article also informs me that the famous\nTata Group in India launched not one but two airlines a few years ago. The journalist gushes about the limitless growth possibili-\nties on the continent. Having just had a great flying experience and feeling excited about the potential of the fast-growing Asian\nairline market, I decide to start some serious work on the subject to evaluate an investment in an Asian airline.\n\nIf you are not from the finance industry, please do not treat this as a frivolous example. Believe it or not, this is how fund\nmanagers sometimes get interested in companies.\n\nAt first glance, there is a lot to like about the airline industry. But, to a fund manager\u2019s ears, I can describe it in two words that\nsound better than Beethoven's symphony: \u201clarge\u201d and \u201cgrowing.\u201d Unless you live in a monastery in a remote corner of the world,\nyour life in the modern world, directly or indirectly, is touched by the airline industry. And the industry is beginning to impact\nAfrica and Asia\u2014the phenomenal growth of Dubai and Singapore as airline hubs during the last decade is testimony to the region\u2019s\n\npotential.\n\nAt this stage, I have two options:\n\n1. Perform a detailed analysis of one Asian airline, or\n\n2. Focus on understanding the outside view of the airline industry.\n\nIf I choose option one, which, incidentally, many fund managers choose, I will waste my time doing the following time-con-\n\nsuming and futile tasks.\n\f"}, "001949.png": {"text": "My team and I will interview the CEO and CFO at a fancy restaurant. Then, we will visit their corporate offices, where the\nsenior management team will wax eloquent on the culture and systems of their unique airline. Finally, we will read tens of ana-\nlyst reports (most of which will be favorable; do you seriously expect an airline analyst to denigrate their industry?), and we will\nbuild a fancy Excel spreadsheet with multiyear forecasts of fuel prices, passenger miles, average ticket prices, load factors, gross\nmargins, capital expenditures, inventory levels, lease costs, personnel expenses, marketing costs, airport charges, freight revenues,\n\nand heaven knows what else.\n\nThe result? After many weeks or months of meetings and late nights, we will either buy or choose a price at which we plan to\n\npurchase the company\u2019s shares if we think the price is too high.\nLet\u2019s see what we would do if we were to choose option two instead.\n\n\u2018We want to analyze the industry in greater depth, and so we start with an extensive study conducted by MIT on the U.S.\nairline industry from 2000 to 2013. The conclusions of this study are in an eighty-one-page document available for free on the in-\n\nternet.12 The results are humbling.\n\nSurprisingly, despite being a mature market, the U.S. industry grew during this period: The revenue of passenger miles grew\nabout 20 percent from 709 million to 848 million. However, on total revenue of about $1.4 trillion during this period, the airlines\nmade a cumulative loss of $44 billion. Thus, on an annual revenue of close to $100 billion, the airline industry lost about $3 billion\n\nevery year from 2000 to 2013.\n\nBut these averages hide an even sorrier story. During eight of these fourteen years (or almost 60 percent of the time), the\nairlines made no money; that is, they declared financial losses or only a meager profit. And in the six years they did manage to eke\n\nout profits, their total net profit was only about $40 billion.\n\nHowever, the real tragedy is that during just two bad years\u20142005 and 2008\u2014the industry suffered losses of $54 billion, or\n$14 billion more than the cumulative profits of $40 billion during the entire period. It is generally assumed that the tragedy of Sep-\n\ntember 11, 2001, was terrible for the airline industry, which is true; U.S. airlines suffered losses of about $19 billion in 2001 and\n\f"}, "001950.png": {"text": "2002. But in 2005, four years after the tragedy and three years before the financial meltdown of 2008, the industry declared a total\nnet loss of $28 billion, far exceeding the losses resulting from September 11.\n\nThe remarkable consistency with which airlines lose money is not a problem unique to the United States. A report from the\nInternational Air Transport Association shows that from 2000 to 2014, the industry had not earned its cost of capital for fifteen\nyears in a row.2 Not even ina single year!\n\nYou must now be thinking what I am thinking. The industry may be destructive overall, but what about the top airlines?\nWould they not be much better than the industry? Let\u2019s look at the return profiles of the top ten airlines (by revenue) in the world\naccording to Aviation Week: Lufthansa, All Nippon, Southwest, Qantas, Air China, American, Singapore, Turk Hava, Aeroflot, and\nRyanair. Using Morningstar, I calculated their return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) for ten years from 2004 to 2013,\nand the results are terrible. The median ROE of these airlines over ten years was 6.8 percent, and the median ROA was 2.5 percent.\nScale does not guarantee success in this demanding industry.\n\nTo sum it up: It\u2019s as bad as it gets.\n\nAfter studying the historical patterns in the airline industry, we can conclude the following with a high degree of confi-\n\ndence:\n\n1.US. airlines do not make money.\n2. The global airline industry does not make money.\n\n3. The top ten airlines in the world do not make money.\n\f"}, "001951.png": {"text": "The detailed and unfortunate outside view of the industry is quite troubling. Airlines are great for consumers, not for\ninvestors. This pessimistic view advises us to stay away from the airline industry. Instead, we should choose to invest our excess\n\ncash in a bank deposit rather than buying a single airline share.\n\nIam sure many of you are now asking the obvious question. Can one make a decision about investing in an Asian airline\nbased on learnings from U.S. and global airlines? If we can conclude that Asia is not dissimilar to the United States, maybe we can\nget comfortable with the fact that the fate of Asian airlines will be no different from their U.S. counterparts. At first glance, the in-\ndustry may appear to be quite different in Asia owing to ownership and international routes. First, most airlines in Asia, including\nSingapore Airlines, are owned by the government, unlike in the United States, where airlines are under private ownership. Second,\nmost of the heavy traffic routes in Asia are between international destinations, not domestic ones (there are no domestic flights in\nSingapore or Dubai!).\n\nBut if we dig a bit deeper into the competitive dynamics, we may conclude that Asia is no different from the United States.\n\nIn the prepandemic days, Expedia showed that if you wanted to fly from Singapore to New York, you could choose from among\ntwenty-two airlines! Competition is no less severe just because the flights are international as opposed to domestic. The airline\nrivalry in Asia may be more intense than in the United States owing to the ownership structure! Since governments care much\nless about economics than private investors, they may not be perturbed by continued financial losses. Moreover, most countries\nseem to treat their airline as a national symbol, so shutting down a national airline, as prudent as it may be for the exchequer, is\nunheard of in Asia. As a result, in my view, invoking convergence to understand the Asian airline industry is a legitimate invest-\n\nment approach.\n\nIn this case, applying the outside view to investing yielded us two significant benefits. First, we avoided investing in a com-\npany and in an industry in which the odds of making money are very slim indeed. I am not suggesting that it is impossible to make\n\nmoney by investing in airlines\u2014if you bought an airline stock at a low enough price (no, I can\u2019t define what is \u201clow enough\u201d) and\n\f"}, "001952.png": {"text": "then were lucky enough to sell it at some profit, good for you. But \u201cI will find a greater fool for my crappy asset\u201d is another way to\n\nsay \u201cspeculating,\u201d not investing. It\u2019s not for us.\n\nThe second benefit was the time, money, and effort saved. Instead of conducting lengthy and unproductive management\nmeetings, schmoozing the investor relations person, paying fat fees to consultants, and spending weeks to construct a multi-\nmegabyte Excel spreadsheet, we spent a few hours on the internet, downloaded a few reports, and made our decision within a few\n\nminutes with enough time left to go home early to our families.\n\nSome Practical Ways of Applying the Principle of Convergence\n\nThis discussion on airlines should not lead anyone to believe that all will be well just by applying the principle of convergence or\nthe outside view to a specific investment situation. Convergence is not a panacea, nor is it a substitute for thoughtful analysis and\n\nsynthesis. But when applied wisely, it can be a powerful investment tool.\n\nI don\u2019t know about the rest of the world, but in India, a married person inherits their spouse\u2019s family. Whether they like it or\nnot. The likelihood of getting along with your spouse over the long term is relatively low if you don\u2019t like your spouse\u2019s first, sec-\n\nond, and occasionally, even third cousins. For the record, my in-laws are the best.\n\nInvesting in companies is no different. Buying into a business means also buying into the industry of that business. For\nexample, while I may think am investing in a company that makes and sells sanitaryware, I am inheriting all the good and the bad\n\nof the sanitaryware industry. No company is an island. We can never ignore the kinds of businesses that surround it.\n\nOne of our principles of convergence investing is that if the industry allows its companies to make money consistently, we\n\nlove it; if not, we better have a perfect reason for spending even one minute analyzing a business like an airline. Life is too short.\n\f"}, "001953.png": {"text": "There are three potential answers to the question of an industry\u2019s attractiveness and profitability. First is that the companies\nin the industry struggle to keep their heads above water, just as we saw in the case of airlines. Industries like telecom towers, gar-\nment manufacturing, and commodity chemicals are notorious value destroyers. Most companies in these industries barely earn\ntheir cost of capital. As I have said repeatedly, one of the immensely underappreciated values of any strategy\u2014including an invest-\nment strategy\u2014is what it advises us not to do. The principle of convergence demands that I avoid investing in these industries. If\n\nmost companies in the industry can\u2019t hack it, why should I believe that this company is unique?\n\nThe second conclusion could be that the industry is uniformly attractive for its participants. For example, companies like\nAccenture, Cognizant, Infosys, and TCS in the information technology (IT) outsourcing industry earn more than 40 to 50 percent\nROCE and have been doing so for decades. If you accept convergence investing as we do, you should love assessing companies in\nthe IT industry. For example, when we evaluated an investment in Mindtree, India\u2019s leading midtier IT services business, we knew\nthat the company had been very profitable for many years. But how could we be sure that it would continue to be successful? By\nwitnessing the convergent outcomes of other businesses in the industry, all of which had been able to scale their revenues over\nmany decades without sacrificing profitability. In other words, it happened there, so all else being equal, there was a high probabil-\n\nity that it could happen here.\n\nMy optimistic view does not mean that I will invest in any company in the IT services industry. Instead, my actual invest-\nment will depend on factors like valuation, financial risk, management track record, capital allocation, customer concentration,\n\nmarket share, and so on. But the companies in this industry would be right on top of my radar as Mindtree was.\n\nYou may think these industries that churn money spinners would be rare\u2014at least that is what microeconomic theory\nwould espouse. But they aren\u2019t. Our portfolio is full of companies in desirable industries: enzymes, paints, cookers, business\n\nprocess outsourcing, bearings, compressors, consumer electricals, sanitaryware, and steam turbines, to name just a few.\n\nLast, convergence can inform us that only some companies make money in specific industries, whereas most others don\u2019t.\n\nFor example, walking along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, I am dazzled by the brilliance and splendor of fashion stores. But fashion\n\f"}, "001954.png": {"text": "is a brutal place to be in\u2014very few companies grow revenues and profits steadily. Most are shooting stars that shine for a few mo-\nments and then disappear into oblivion. The same is true for retailers and restaurants. These are the trickiest companies for us to\nassess. Should we bet on a single business in an unattractive industry, or should we just walk away? If we evaluate a company in\nthese industries, which we rarely do, we are exceptionally demanding\u2014we will not invest in anyone but the undisputed leader.\nWe use the principle of convergence across many other areas of business apart from assessing industry attractiveness. We\nuse it much more often to figure out what not to do.\nI want to take you back to chapter 1, which focused exclusively on the importance of avoiding significant risks. I contended\n\nthat avoiding risky investments is more important and more difficult for most investors than making good investments.\n\nAs a quick reminder, I highlighted six types of businesses we avoid at all costs:\n\n1. Those owned and run by crooks\n2. Turnaround situations\n\n3. Those with high levels of debt\n\n4, M&A junkies\n\n5. Those in fast-changing industries\n\n6. Those with unaligned owners\n\nHow did I arrive at this list? Through a combination of reliving bad experiences (1, 2, and 5), doing some factual data anal-\nysis (4, 5, and 6), watching others stumble (2, 3, and 6), and learning from owners of portfolio companies (4 and 5). The common.\n\nthread through all of these was the hunger for detecting patterns and seeking a convergence of outcomes.\n\f"}, "001955.png": {"text": "Investors can detect (or manufacture) a vast range of patterns across businesses. This is not the place to discuss all of them.\nInstead, this chapter intends to make the simple claim that one of the most important questions an investor can ask is, \u201cWhere\nelse has this worked?\u201d Before moving on, let me discuss one more aspect of convergence investing that (I think) has been critical to\nour success.\n\nWe are price sensitive. The median trailing price/earnings (PE) ratio for our portfolio at the time of our investment is less\nthan 15 when the Indian market has been about 19 to 20. We have rarely ever paid more than twenty times trailing PE. Most im-\nportantly, we have never said, \u201cThis is such a great business that even 30 PE is justified.\u201d\n\nAs I have made clear in previous chapters, we have no interest in investing in low-quality or mediocre businesses at any\nprice. Our portfolio companies are truly stellar based on verifiable empirical data on historical financials, industry market share,\nbalance sheet quality, and customer satisfaction. Moreover, the markets are generally quite efficient\u2014businesses like these are\n\nrarely available at a throwaway price. Since we have chosen to invest exclusively in world-class businesses, we have two options:\n\n1. Invest at a high valuation hoping that the price will rise further, or\n\n2. Stay inactive for long periods until we get the price we want.\n\nWe have always chosen option two. Why? Convergence. Valuation matters for equity returns over the long run across years,\ncountries, and the size of companies. The lower the valuation, the higher the prospective long-term returns. It has worked every-\nwhere over very long periods, so who are we to defy it?\n\nThere is a lot of empirical research on equity valuation and returns. The article on this topic that I like best is \u201cValue and\nGrowth Investing: Review and Update\u201d by Louis K. C. Chan and Josef Lakonishok.+4 I love this article for two reasons.

It\u2019s always good to hear from people whose\n\nresearch conclusions matter to their bank balance.\n\nThe article has many tables with reams of data, and if you don\u2019t have much time, I suggest focusing on table 2. It shows re-\nturns over twenty years (from 1975 to 1995) across thirteen countries for \u201cvalue\u201d stocks (those with low valuation) and \u201cglamour\u201d\nstocks (those with high valuation) across four valuation measures. The results are stark. The value portfolio beats the glamour\nportfolio across almost all countries. And the outperformance is not trivial: It ranges from 1.5 percentage points for Switzerland to\n\n6.7 percentage points for the United States (based on PE ratio as the valuation measure).\n\nThe first paragraph of their conclusion is worth repeating in full:\n\nA large body of empirical research indicates that value stocks, on average, earn higher returns than growth stocks. The re-\nward to value investing is more pronounced for small-cap stocks, but it is also present in large-cap stocks. The value premium\n\nexists also in equity markets outside the United States.\n\nWhy should we risk investing at high valuations when we know that the result will be poor on average? Some of you may de-\ntect a paradox here. Unlike LSV Asset Management, which relies on sophisticated quantitative analysis, we do in-depth qualitative\nresearch on industries and businesses. As a result, we know a lot about our portfolio companies and their industries. Given that we\nhave an informed view of them, should we not be willing to pay up when the opportunity arises?\n\nNo.\n\nWhy? Because I have more respect for the convergence theme with respect to valuation and potential returns than my intel-\n\nlect. I wish I were more intelligent. But Iam not.\n\nWe now arrive at an obvious question. Under what situations should we not apply the principle of convergence?\n\f"}, "001957.png": {"text": "Not as Straightforward as It Sounds\n\nSomeone wise\u2014reputed to be Einstein, but there is no agreement\u2014once remarked, \u201cEverything should be made as simple as\npossible, but not simpler.\u201d Life is complicated, and so is investing. The principle of convergence may seem intelligible (I hope) and\n\nits implementation a cinch. Sorry to disappoint you, but this seemingly easy-to-use tool generates its own set of thorny issues.\n\nGive me a conclusion you desire, and I am reasonably confident that I would rationalize it based on the principle of conver-\ngence. A couple of anecdotes may masquerade as a pattern, one pattern can be ignored in favor of another, or one can simply resort\n\nto telling a story that seems to weave in an outside view where there is none.\n\nIf you are an investor or choose to be one, you will need to learn your lessons the hard way. However, here are some pointers\n\nbased on my experience.\n\nThe probability of convergent evolution is higher in living organisms if they share similarities in genetics, development, and\necology. Unsurprisingly, the greater the similarity of \u201cconditions\u201d in businesses, the greater is the benefit of using the principle\nof convergence in investing. \u201cConditions\u201d here could mean industry structure, geography, competitive dynamics, stage of busi-\nness, the similarity of business models, and much more. For example, we saw that the Caribbean anoles were endowed with the\nsame physical attributes when conditions were similar across the islands. Therefore, businesses should operate under the same\nprinciple.\n\nLet me take the example of three types of businesses to explain the complications of applying the principle of convergence.\n\nAssume that I am evaluating an investment in a company that builds residential properties in Germany. To incorporate an\noutside view, I would start with developing an understanding of the dynamics of the German residential property market\u2014the\nindustry participants, track record of growth and profitability, extent of consolidation, and anything else that would get me smart\non the overall German residential market. I would prefer not to draw parallels with Germany\u2019s commercial or retail real estate mar-\n\nket because the industry structure and types of players are usually different across these segments.\n\f"}, "001958.png": {"text": "Should I study the French, Spanish, or Brazilian residential real estate market? It depends whether these other markets have\na similar industry structure to that of Germany (e.g., is the industry fragmented or consolidated?) or whether the regulations are\nprimarily comparable (e.g., if a government subsidizes mortgage payments for its citizens, it will dramatically affect consumer\nbehavior). Intuitively, given the cultural and historical affinity of the French and Spanish residential markets, I would be more\ninclined to draw lessons from those markets and not Brazil\u2019s. But maybe someone can find a way to draw lessons even from Brazil.\nWhat about the U.S. residential real estate market? I am not sure. I would need to do some work to understand if there are any par-\nallels between Germany and the United States.\n\nTake the case of a German company manufacturing industrial robots. These robots are supplied to manufacturing busi-\nnesses across the world. Since this is a global business, I would not worry too much about the German angle here. Instead, I would\nresearch enterprises supplying the same or similar equipment worldwide, whether based in China, Italy, or Singapore, to under-\nstand their growth, profitability, and trends in market share. I would also go one level \u201chigher\u201d to analyze the performance of\nglobal businesses that supply sophisticated industrial machinery. I may not assign as much weight to this second analysis, but I\nwould study it to discern any apparent trends if available.\n\nSome of you may argue that I was too quick to dismiss the German engineering businesses in general. Maybe something\nabout German engineering strength can serve as a template for an industrial robot business. I am skeptical. But perhaps you are\nright. So go ahead and do the work.\n\nThird, take the case of a German hospital business. Should we use convergent investing by assessing the economics and in-\ndustry structure of hospitals in the United Kingdom, Italy, and the Netherlands? Health care in most markets is heavily regulated,\nand this may significantly impact the economics of a hospital. It would be too cumbersome to assess the impact of local laws on\nthe hospitals in each country. Instead, we could use a shortcut to see if the overall hospital economics\u2014or those of the top five to\nten hospitals if industry data are unavailable\u2014are comparable across countries. Since hospitals are a services business, can we use\n\nthe information from other German services sectors (say, hotels) to refine our assessment?

Convergent evolution is\nmore evident in plants and insects since they have been around on Earth longer than birds and mammals.\u2018 It takes time for con-\n\nvergence to emerge. This fact is equally applicable to the world of business.\n\nWe have noticed greater convergence in older industries (e.g., paint, garments, engines, turbines, cars) and less in newer\nones (e.g., virtual reality, robotics, electric vehicles, biotechnology). Industries converge toward similar fates after the companies\nhave had enough time to plan and execute their strategies, after winners and losers have been (essentially) decided, and when the\npace of change has declined.

First, he wanted to use microscopic organisms that have a generation time of only twenty\nminutes, thereby allowing tens of thousands of generations to evolve over a human lifetime. Second, unlike the artificial selection\nexperiments on foxes (or dogs or wheat), in which the experimenter chooses who (or what) reproduces, Lenski wanted the experi-\n\nmental environment to choose.\n\nWhen the experiment started, all twelve flasks had genetically the same E. coli since all cells came from the same mother\ncell. Each flask contained hundreds of millions of bacteria, so there was ample opportunity for mutations to emerge. An essential\nexperimental twist was that food was in limited supply. Every day, the E. coli population increased for about six hours until the\nglucose was exhausted. At this point, the bacteria would stop dividing and wait. The next day, a lab member\u2014someone like Tim\nCooper\u2014would take 0.1 milliliters out of each flask (1 percent of the flask\u2019s content) and inoculate a new flask containing 9.9\nmilliliters of fresh glucose solution. A new cycle would then begin until the next day, when the same procedure would be repeated.\n\nAnd the next day. Week after week, month after month, year after year.\n\nLenski was replaying Gould\u2019s proverbial tape of life simultaneously in twelve flasks. He wasn\u2019t selecting the bacteria, and he\nwasn\u2019t varying the medium. Instead, he was letting life run its course in parallel over thousands of generations. What he found\nwas remarkable. In 2011, after fifty thousand generations of evolution, he said, \u201cTo my surprise, evolution was pretty repeat-\nable. ... Although the lineages certainly diverged in many details, I was struck by the parallel trajectories of their evolution, with\n\nsimilar changes in so many phenotypic traits and even gene sequences we examined.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that the bacteria had not evolved. On the contrary, they had evolved a lot. The E. coli in different flasks adapted\ndifferently to the starvation diet by either growing faster or becoming more numerous than earlier generations. But the general\ntrend was unmistakable: On average, the population grew 70 percent faster than their founding ancestors. In addition, the re-\nsearchers found another example of convergent evolution. All twelve populations of bacteria had lost the ability to synthesize a\n\nsugar called D-ribose because all had undergone the same set of genetic changes.\n\f"}, "001961.png": {"text": "Unlike Gould\u2019s prediction, the replaying of the tape of life was yielding the same result.\n\nUntil one day, fifteen years after the start of the experiment, Tim Cooper found that it didn\u2019t.\n\nThe reason the Ara-3 flask had turned opaque was that, unlike the other flasks, it had experienced a population explosion.\nThe Ara-3 population was ten times the size of the populations in the other flasks. How could this have happened when all flasks\nhad only a limited amount of glucose?\n\nThe Ara-3 bacteria had developed the ability to feed on some other ingredient in the solution. The only other candidate was\na molecule called citrate present in all glucose solutions from day one. However, at the time of the beginning of the experiment, E.\ncoli was explicitly known not to synthesize citrate in the presence of oxygen. Therefore, this inability was used to identify whether\na type of bacteria was E. coli or not!\n\nThe 33,127th generation of Lenski\u2019s bacteria had deviated drastically from the clean and simple story of inevitable conver-\ngence.

Acting on a dishonest signal and ignoring an honest one can lead to hunger\n\nor death in the natural world, a fate not too dissimilar to a fund\u2019s performance.\n\n \n\f"}, "001972.png": {"text": "7.1 The strutting male: Whose signal is more honest, (a) the businessperson\u2019s or (b) the deer\u2019s?\n\n \n\n\u2018Source: Licensed from Shutterstock.\n\nBut how is an investor supposed to distinguish between an honest signal and a dishonest one?\nLet\u2019s turn to the Israeli evolutionary biologist Amotz Zahavi for an exquisitely elegant answer.\n\nBut first, a brief background on signals. In the early and middle parts of the twentieth century, ethologists (ethology is the\nstudy of animal behavior) believed that signals were essentially honest indicators of senders\u2019 underlying motives. However, in the\n1970s, two British scientists, Richard Dawkins and John Krebs, took an almost diametrically opposite view claiming that signals\nwere best seen as a deceitful manipulation by a sender to alter the behavior of the receiver for the sender\u2019s benefit.1\u00b0 On the other\nhand, the receiver was trying to fathom the true motive of the sender and plotting its own moves. According to Dawkins and\n\nKrebs, this leads to an arms race in which the sender and receiver are constantly trying to outdo each other.\n\nHowever, Amotz Zahavi rejected this pessimistic view of signals. In 1975, he proposed his famous \u201chandicap principle,\u201d\nwhich explains how and why honest signals can evolve in the natural world where animals are presumably trying to deceive one\nanother. Zahavi\u2019s profound observation was that when signals for a particular trait are costly to produce\u2014he rightly termed such\nsignals \u201chandicaps\u2019\u2014and cannot be matched by another with a lower quality of that trait, they can be deemed \u201chonest.\u201d That may\nsound logical, but science, unlike the investment profession, needs empirical evidence to support its tall claims. The scientific com-\nmunity did not fully accept the handicap principle until fifteen years after the publication of the article in which Zahavi presented\nit.42 In 1990, two articles by the Scottish biologist Alan Grafen finally turned the tide in its favor.\n\nThe best route to understanding the handicap principle is through carotenoids. Carotenoids are a class of pigments ranging\nfrom yellow to orange to red. They also provide health benefits by acting as antioxidants and strengthening the immune system.\n\nAnimals can\u2019t synthesize carotenoids within their bodies and must procure them by eating plants, bacteria, or fungi. Carotenoids\n\f"}, "001973.png": {"text": "play a strong signaling role, and scientists have studied their effect extensively in three species: the house finch (a bird), the three-\n\nspined stickleback (a fish), and the guppy.\n\nIf the handicap principle is accurate, we should be able to confirm the following three hypotheses:\n\n1. Females are differentially attracted to males with redder or brighter hues,\n2. Males with a redder coloration are fitter than paler males, and\n\n3. It is costly for healthy males to produce a deep red pigment.\n\nIn the species studied, researchers have shown conclusively that females react more favorably to males that display a deeper\ncarotenoid pigmentation. Male house finches, for example, have three patches of carotenoid pigmentation on their body: on the\ncrown, throat, and rump. Each patch varies in coloration from pale yellow to bright red. Experiments clearly show that female\nhouse finches prefer to consort with redder males whether this redness results from natural diet or artificial dyes. This finding\nsupports the first hypothesis: receiver response.\n\nTo provide support for the second hypothesis (signal honesty), scientists demonstrated that well-fed house finches devel-\noped a deeper red coloration compared to those fed less nutritious food. When researchers exposed three-spined sticklebacks\nto parasites, the ones with a higher load of infectious ciliate had a significant decrease in red coloration. Other experiments like\nthe one by Godin and McDonough described earlier have found evidence for the same phenomenon in guppies. Thus, deeper\n\ncarotenoid pigmentation does seem to indicate better overall health.\n\nLet\u2019s now deal with the last and most crucial hypothesis: whether honest signals impose a cost on the signaler. Over the\nyears, biologists have unearthed four possible costs of deeper carotenoid pigmentation. First, carotenoid levels in fish scales or bird\nplumage are directly correlated with the amount of carotenoid in the animal\u2019s gut. Thus, the more time an animal spends eating\n\nnutritious food, the redder the pigment but also the greater the cost incurred. Second, since carotenoids have health benefits and\n\f"}, "001974.png": {"text": "are needed to ward off disease and parasites, redirecting them from the gut to dead tissues like scales or feathers for display pur-\nposes is a costly maneuver for the animal. Third, displaying carotenoid pigmentation involves the cost of processing carotenoids\nin the gut and then transporting them to the feathers or scales. Hence, only those animals that have eaten enough nutritious food\nare up to the task. The fourth obvious cost is the risk of death: A deep red coloration charms females and foes alike. In laboratory\nexperiments, trout have been shown to be more likely to attack redder sticklebacks, and blue acara cichlids are more likely to kill\nguppies with greater carotenoid pigmentation.\n\nThus, according to the handicap principle, redder male house finches attract more mates presumably because their message\nto females is, \u201cLook how healthy and virile I am; 1 am so darned red!\u201d It would be very costly and potentially even suicidal for a\n\nweak or diseased house finch to produce more carotenoid pigmentation given the diversion of resources required.\n\nObviously, male house finches do not consciously \u201cdecide\u201d to produce redder colors; the healthier ones simply have enough\nnutritional resources to produce the pigmentation, and the weaker ones don\u2019t. Ditto for the brightly colored male guppy in the\nexample mentioned earlier. Or the dude with the shiny red Ferrari. All of them show off ornaments that are very expensive to pro-\nduce or procure and hence accurately communicate the signaler\u2019s well-being.\n\nAnd herein lies Zahavi\u2019s lesson for us investors: Lend credence only to those signals from companies that are costly to produce.\n\nThat, however, is easier said than done. What does \u201ccostly to produce\u201d mean in the context of a corporate environment?\nWhat is the equivalent of a peacock\u2019s resplendent tail? A shiny new corporate headquarters, an industry award, a growing market\nvalue, a CEO\u2019s Forbes profile, or something else? I am a practicing investor, not a finance academic. I cannot offer a regression model\nproven to be statistically relevant, but I can offer the practical ways in which my team and I distinguish between honest and dis-\n\nhonest signals.\n\nDishonest Signals Galore\n\f"}, "001975.png": {"text": "Let\u2019s start with real-life examples of dishonest signals; that is, those that do not reliably communicate the trait they are supposed\nto. A \u201cdishonest\u201d signal does not imply that the sender is dishonest, although they might be; it simply means that the signal may\nnot communicate what it is supposed to. Just as in the natural world, an honest person in a business setting can send a dishonest\n\nsignal without necessarily having a bad intention.\n\nWhen we evaluate a business to make an investment or divestment, we ignore the following types of signals or assign them\n\na very low weight in our overall evaluation.\n\nPress Releases\n\nOn July 29, 2014, Apple\u2019s press release claimed that the company had updated the MacBook Pro with Retina Display (note the capi-\n\ntal \u201cR\u201d and \u201cD\u201d).13 Should investors have cared about this news?\n\nMaybe you would have been impressed if you were a discerning consumer, but how would this announcement have helped\nan investor decide if Apple was a good company to buy? You could argue that the press release indicated Apple\u2019s prowess in keeping\nup with the latest technology trends, and so it was, in fact, quite informative. But how many investors\u2014or nontechies in general\u2014\n\neven know or understand what \u201cRetina Display\u201d means? I don\u2019t.\n\nEven if Retina Display, whatever it is, were to turn out to be a cool new technology, how was anyone to conclude from this in-\nformation that the MacBook Pro would become a success? And to belabor the point, even if an investor did understand what Retina\nDisplay meant, and even if they concluded from various sources that it was likely to be a great success, how would this knowledge\nhelp them decide whether to buy Apple shares unless they could accurately forecast the profits and cash flows to be made from the\n\nincreased sales of the MacBook Pro as a result of this technology?\n\nApress release is probably the most used\u2014or should I say \u201cabused\u201d?\u2014signal given out by companies. The reason? It does not\n\ncost anything for the company to be in the press regularly apart from the retainer for the PR agency, which is usually an annual\n\f"}, "001976.png": {"text": "fixed expense.

But even those that\nare not professionals at managing the press through their public relations consultants rarely have anything helpful to say for a\nlong-term investor.\n\nSecond, press releases can be\u2014and frequently are\u2014more insidious than the harmless MacBook Pro announcement. Many\npress releases appear to reveal significant information that a long-term investor must absorb but turn out to be empty boasts at\nbest and deliberate obfuscation at worst.\n\nTake the example of a Unilever press release from January 20, 2015.14 The headline states confidently, \u201cProfitable Growth\nin Tougher Markets.\u201d A detailed look at the press release left me scratching my confused head. I assume you agree that developed\nmarkets like the United States and Western Europe should be classified as \u201ctough\u201d because they are mature, have high competitive\nintensity, and have growth challenges. But if you read the press release carefully, you will notice that sales in 2014 declined by 0.8\npercent in developed markets. Sales did grow 5.7 percent in emerging markets (though even this growth was lower than in 2013),\nbut I would not call emerging markets \u201ctough.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the press release fails to mention which markets, according to Unilever, are \u201ctough\u201d and which are \u201ceasy.\u201d\nMaybe you disagree with me and prefer to call emerging markets tough. Alright, let\u2019s go ahead with that definition. But then how\ndoes one explain a sales decline of 20 percent in the fourth quarter in China? A slowdown of this magnitude, especially in a market\nas large as China, may be relevant information for investors, but as we saw, it is nowhere in the headlines. Unilever\u2019s overall sales in\n2014, by the way, declined by 2.7 percent. Was this the cause for celebration that the press release seemed to imply?\n\nThe bottom line is that making investment or divestment decisions based on a press release can be harmful to a fund\u2019s bot-\ntom line. We treat press releases as what they are: a cheap signal given by companies to make competitors envious and to attract\n\ninvestors, employees, and customers.\n\f"}, "001977.png": {"text": "We don\u2019t give them any importance.\n\nManagement Interviews in the Media\n\nIt was June 13, 2019.

Analysts and investors follow earn-\n\nings guidance quite seriously, and stock prices react promptly to the under- or overachievement of this guidance.\n\nInvestors and analysts love earnings guidance from companies. In fact, according to an article from PR Newswire, 77 percent\nof the 180 analysts surveyed wanted companies to provide guidance.1\u00e9 Analysts are smart folks, so you must be thinking that they\n\ncan learn a lot from the future pronouncements of companies.

Earnings guidance is a dishonest signal even though the management may fervently believe in it. It is cheap, easy to\n\nproduce, and needs little effort to deliver.\n\nIn my career spanning more than three decades, I have sat on the boards of more than two dozen companies ranging from\na market value of $5 million to about $50 billion. At the beginning of every fiscal year, all these company management teams\nusually present their budgets for the year.

The businesses either exceeded their budgets or underperformed. And they\n\nhad no way of knowing which would happen.\n\nThere is a simple reason why earnings are so hard to predict: multiplicative probability. Earnings\u2014or profit after tax\u2014is the\nlast line item on a company profit-and-loss statement. We can calculate profit after tax after deducting from revenues the cash\nexpenses, noncash expenses (like depreciation and amortization), financial charges, and taxes.

And under Jack Welch,\nthe CEO of GE from 1981 to 2001, it scaled heights never seen by any company on the planet.2 Under his leadership, the company\nincreased its market value more than forty times over two decades. In August 2000, GE\u2019s market value was $601 billion, making\nit the most valuable company on Earth. By the end of 2021, it was a shadow of its former self, having lost about 85 percent of its\n\nvalue.\n\nMany things went wrong at GE, and this is not the place to list them, but one of the most striking things about GE during the\nJack Welch era was its ability to hit its earnings target quarter after quarter, year after year.

GE\u2019s stock price went into a decline that hasn\u2019t been arrested more than two decades after\n\nWelch's retirement.\n\nIam not suggesting that all of GE\u2019s problems resulted from its guidance culture, but I think it played a significant role. When\nbusiness managers are hyper-focused on meeting quarterly numbers, their long-term orientation takes a back seat; when a com-\npany is desperate to make an acquisition just to meet its earnings, it can overpay for a bad asset; when a manager is unable to speak\n\nthe truth about accounting obfuscations, they pile up over time.\n\f"}, "001985.png": {"text": "Last, let\u2019s assume for a moment that a company can accurately predict its earnings without any accounting shenanigans of\nthe kind employed by GE.

Old habits die hard.\n\nFace-to-Face Meetings with Management\n\nIn mid-2015, Valeant, a pharmaceutical company run by a McKinsey alum called Mike Pearson, was the darling of the stock market\n\nand had a market value of about $90 billion. Just five years before, in 2010, its market value was only about $5 billion.\n\nThere was no business magazine that had not covered the stupendous success of Valeant. Nothing could stop this jugger-\nnaut acquiring pharma companies and cutting costs to the bone to enhance profits. Investors loved Mike and his seemingly un-\n\nbeatable strategy, and marquee investors like Pershing Square, Sequoia, and ValueAct were big fans.\n\nCharlie Munger, however, was having none of it. He rightly spotted that Valeant\u2019s debt-fueled acquisition spree was a recipe\nfor disaster. Combined with Valeant\u2019s numerous unethical business practices (e.g., raising the prices of life-saving drugs many\ntimes after acquiring them), he opined that Valeant would fail spectacularly sooner or later. In a May 2016 interview with Fox\n\nBusiness, Munger called the company worse than a sewer!!2\n\nMunger\u2019s views irritated some of Valeant\u2019s largest shareholders, including Bill Ackman, the CIO of Pershing Square. He wrote\n\na lengthy letter to Munger in April 2015 requesting him to meet with Mike Pearson, but Munger refused. Munger did not needa\n\f"}, "001986.png": {"text": "meeting to detect the \u201chonest\u201d signals of Valeant\u2019s corruption and incompetence. Valeant had its comeuppance soon after and by\n\nmid-2016 had lost 90 percent of its value. Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square took a loss of $3 billion on Valeant.\n\nWhy were so many experienced investors blind to the problems that Munger had highlighted publicly? Why could Munger\ncorrectly predict Valeant\u2019s demise without meeting Mike Pearson when many of Valeant\u2019s board members and investors continued\nto be passionate supporters? My hypothesis is this: Mike Pearson was a fantastic salesperson. Correction. He was probably one of\n\nthe best salespeople to have enamored Wall Street.\n\nThe smartest people lost their sense of judgment when faced with Mike Pearson\u2019s persuasive skills. Valeant\u2019s honest signals\nof its myriad problems remained undetected or ignored in the light of the dishonest signals emitted by Mike Pearson in face-to-\n\nface meetings, which by definition were cheap to produce.\n\nAgain, Iam not asserting that Mike Pearson was dishonest. Maybe he genuinely believed what he said. It doesn\u2019t really mat-\n\nter. The reason Munger was right was that he knew that any face-to-face meeting is a dishonest signal.\n\nThis claim that face-to-face meetings aren't a reliable signal may seem strange at first glance given the importance of man-\nagement teams for most investors, whether they are venture capitalists, private equity funds, or mutual funds. Many investors\n\ntake pride in judging management teams based on a single meeting, and if you are one such investor, good for you. Iam not.\n\nThe odds are that many investors think they are good at judging people, but they generally aren\u2019t. Let\u2019s assume we encounter\na genius who is genuinely able to judge a person\u2019s character based on a face-to-face meeting. My assertion here is even if they pos-\nsess this rare skill, it will be useless in a management meeting and will not enable them to become a better investor. The reason is\nsimple: Any signal that management gives during a meeting is a cheap signal requiring minimal effort. And since it is cheap, the\nsignal may be dishonest even if the management is not.\n\nFor example, management may believe that their product is high quality, and they will say so in a meeting. Would you\nbelieve their assertion, or would you do independent checks to assess the product\u2019s quality? Management may genuinely believe\n\nthat their recent underperformance relative to domestic competition is a result of their focus on overseas markets.

We never use management meetings to build an investment case or test key hypotheses because we\n\nknow we will hear what they want us to hear, not what we want to know.\n\nInvoking Zahavi to Interpret Signals That Matter\n\nIt looks like we are in a bit of soup here. If we can\u2019t rely on press releases, investor conferences, earnings guidance, or management\nmeetings, what kinds of signals can we, as investors, trust?\n\nLet\u2019s go back to Amotz Zahavi, whose assertion about the natural world is highly relevant to the investing world: We should\ntrust only costly signals emitted by companies because they are the only ones we can rely on.

Broadly, there are two.\n\nWe know the first one from chapter 5.\n\nPast Operating and Financial Performance\n\nI will not rehash the logic I outlined in chapter 5 for visiting the past to assess a business and industry; suffice it to say that we at\nNalanda treat the past as one of two critical and reliable signals for our investment and divestment decisions. The past has hap-\npened. It is there for us to see. It is an undeniable signal of the company\u2019s actions and outcomes. The problem, of course, is that in-\n\nvestors seem intently focused on receiving signals about the future.\n\f"}, "001988.png": {"text": "Let\u2019s take the example of a ubiquitous phenomenon in the world of investing: conference calls.\n\nI know] discussed conference calls in chapter 5, but it\u2019s important to revisit the phenomenon in the light of honest and\ndishonest signals. A quarterly call is a strong signal sent by the management to the broader analyst and investor community. The\nCEO, CFO, and some other key business leaders typically attend the calls. If there is one place where you can get all your answers,\nthis is it. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jack Dorsey formerly of Twitter, Tim Cook of Apple, Elon Musk of\nTesla\u2014all these business leaders regularly attend their companies\u2019 quarterly calls.\n\nLet\u2019s take a concrete example. Chevron, one of the world\u2019s largest oil companies, had revenues of about $140 billion and\na market value of about $190 billion in 2019. The management held a conference call for investors and analysts on January 31,\n2020, to highlight its performance. The analysts and investors asked twenty-nine questions. What percentage of these do you\n\nthink were about the future? More than 70 percent.\n\nHere is a small sample of these future-directed questions:\n\n+ Can you talk a little bit more about how you think about volumes in 2020?

In the fourth quarter of\n2020, revenue had dropped to $25 billion from $35 billion a year earlier, a reduction of almost 30 percent. During the conference\n\ncall, management predicted capital spending of $21 billion in 2020.

Third, L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s chair is\nembroiled in a legal battle among the family members who own L\u2019Or\u00e9al.

To compre-\n\nhend Kurt\u00e9n\u2019s stunning claim, we need to revisit Darwin's assertion in Origin:\n\nI do believe that natural selection will always act very slowly, often only at long intervals of time, and generally only on a very\nfew of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time. I further believe that this prolonged, intermittent action of natu-\nral selection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of this world\n\nhave changed.\n\nAs we learned in chapter 5, Darwin was inspired by the famous geologist Charles Lyell who proposed the theory of unifor-\nmitarianism. Lyell contended that the earth has slowly and uniformly changed over the millennia and that understanding the\npresent is key to interpreting the past. He directly contradicted the prevailing theory of catastrophism, which suggested that the\nfeatures of the earth, like mountains, resulted from extensive and sudden changes or catastrophes. Darwin applied Lyell\u2019s theory\nof geological evolution to the biological world. He believed that just as the earth evolves slowly over very long periods, so does the\nworld of animals and plants.\n\nThe upshot of Darwin\u2019s insight is that if we were to measure the pace of evolution, it would correlate proportionately with\nthe measurement period: It would be slow over brief periods and fast over long periods. Darwin's theory stressed that species\n\nevolve slowly. This idea was gospel until Kurt\u00e9n\u2019s article was published in 1959.\n\f"}, "002008.png": {"text": "Kurt\u00e9n plotted the evolution of the length of the second lower molar of the brown bear in Europe during the Pleistocene\nepoch (between 2.6 million and 11,700 years ago). Let\u2019s examine the data in table 8.2 for the rate of change of the molar measured\n\nin Darwins (one Darwin is a change of 1/1000 in 1,000 years) and the period of measurement.\n\nTABLE 8.2 The inverse relationship between measurement period and evolutionary change\n\n \n\n \n\nMeasurement period (years) Rate of change (Darwins)\n400,000 0.41\n100,000 0.90\n80,000 0.76\n50,000 2.20\n22,000 3.20\n8,000 13.8\n\nDo you see a trend here? Kurt\u00e9n\u2019s data show that evolution appeared to occur quite quickly when measured over short\nperiods and slowly when the measurement period was prolonged. Thus, when measured over 400,000 years, the rate of change of\nthe molar was 0.41 Darwins, but over 8,000 years, the rate of change was an astounding 13.8 Darwins. He demonstrated a similar\n\ntrend in other fossilized mammalian species, including horses.\nI was incredulous when I first read about Kurt\u00e9n\u2019s conclusion. Suppose we accept the Darwinian notion that the current\n\ndiversity of the world is the result of species transforming slowly (but surely) throughout the eons. How is it possible that the pace\n\nof evolution is slower over more extended periods and faster over shorter periods?\n\f"}, "002009.png": {"text": "Kurt\u00e9n\u2019s article was not an outlier. In a 2009 article titled \u201cRates of Evolution,\u201d Philip D. Gingerich, a paleontologist at the\nUniversity of Michigan, also supported Kurt\u00e9n\u2019s claim.2 He demonstrated mathematically and empirically that phenotypic change\n(ie., changes in the bodily characteristics of a species) could be rapid from one generation to the next. In contrast, evolution can be\n\nslow on long time scales.\n\nDoes this inverse correlation between the rate of change of bodily parts and the time interval of measurement also apply\nto genes? It does. Simon Ho, an Australian evolutionary biologist, and his colleagues provide an excellent overview of this seem-\ningly un-Darwinian phenomenon in their 2011 article, \u201cTime-Dependent Rates of Molecular Evolution.\u201d They summarize the\nresearch done by several scientists on the genomes of humans, insects, birds, fish, and even bacteria and viruses. Most of this re-\nsearch points in the same direction: Contrary to expectation, the pace of genetic evolution is inversely correlated with the period of\n\nmeasurement.\n\nThe Grants Take It One Step Further\n\nAll the research studies mentioned so far have examined evolution over hundreds or thousands of years. Do these conclusions also\n\napply over a few years or decades?\n\n\u2018We now return to Peter Boag and Laurene Ratcliffe, who had been stunned by the result of their analysis of Darwin\u2019s finches,\nboth dead and living. On the small island of Daphne Major in the Galapagos, they witnessed what no one had seen before: natural\nselection and evolution occurring in real time in two species of finches. As Boag stated in his famous 1981 Science article, the in-\n\ntensity of natural selection in the birds was \u201cthe highest yet recorded for a vertebrate population.\u201d>\n\nFossils show that evolution has occurred, and Darwin's irrefutable logic argues that natural selection can drive evolution.\n\nHowever, no one had ever seen natural selection and evolution in action. Darwin didn\u2019t think it was even possible. In 1893, the\n\f"}, "002010.png": {"text": "German evolutionary biologist August Weismann wrote, \u201cIt is very difficult to imagine this process of natural selection in its details;\n\nand to this day, it is impossible to demonstrate it in any one point\u201d (author\u2019s emphasis).\n\nIn their book, The Variation of Animals in Nature, the British evolutionary biologists Guy C. Robson and Owain W.

Boag and Ratcliffe\u2019s observations changed the field of evolution forever.\nThey were part of a long-term project started by Peter and Rosemary Grant, a married British couple and currently emeritus pro-\nfessors at Princeton. The Grants wanted to study evolution in the wild and discover the key factors that lead to new species. So they\ndecided to study Darwin\u2019s finches, also called Galapagos finches.

The Galapagos group of islands is almost one thousand kilometers off the west coast of Ecuador. Owing to its\nremote location, it is home to several endemic species (i.e., species not found anywhere else in the world). There are about a dozen\n\ncentral and minor islands in the archipelago.\n\nDaphne Major is small, nondescript, and remote even by the standards of Galapagos (Darwin did not even see it) and mea-\nsures barely a square kilometer in area.\n\nThe next time I feel like complaining about the firmness of the mattress or the softness of the pillows in a hotel room, I hope\nI remember what the Grants endured on Daphne Major for six months every year for forty consecutive years. Before the Grants and\ntheir research staff made it their home, no humans had lived there. How could they? There is only one way to enter the island, and\nthat is the base ofa cliff since the island has no shoreline.\n\nTo set up their camp every year, here is what the Grants had to do. They had to abandon their boat as they neared the island\nand approach the cliff base at low tide in a rowboat called a panga. A single black ledge filled with barnacles was their only landing\npoint; it\u2019s the size of a large exercise mat. They needed to leap onto this mat while the panga swayed wildly in the ocean waves.\nFrom here, they had to walk up the cliff on hard, wet rocks until they arrived at another ledge that they called the Landing. Then\nthey formed a human chain and passed up tents, poles, water, food, and everything else they would need for the next six months.\nDaphne Major has no water or food. They could pitch their tents only at one spot, which was the size of a table and on the rim ofa\n\nvolcano. They had to lug all their supplies there from the base of the cliff. They cooked their meals in a small cave protected from\n\f"}, "002013.png": {"text": "the harsh sun by a sheet of cloth. Once settled, they would spend the next six months measuring the body size, beak size, and beak\n\nshape of every finch on the island. They would also extract blood to do a genetic analysis.\n\nWhy would anyone in their right mind spend time on such an island? Because it offered many advantages that few other\n\nplaces could.\n\nDaphne Major was so far removed from the other islands that there was only a minimal chance that the finches or other\nisland species could escape or that new ones could arrive. It was a perfect petri dish for evolutionary studies because it would not\nget \u201ccontaminated.\u201d Also, the Grants realized that the Galapagos were a gold mine for testing and refining Darwin's theory. The\nGalapagos Islands undergo extreme climate swings\u2014from severe drought to copious rain\u2014thereby providing ample opportunity\nfor natural selection. Last, Daphne Major was small enough to track every bird that lives there over many years, which they did.\nFrom 1973 to 2012, the Grants tagged about twenty thousand birds over eight generations, and they tracked almost every copulat-\ning pair and their offspring.\n\nIn the first four years of their study\u2014from 1973 to 1976\u2014the island received average or excess rainfall. But in 1977, after a\nbrief spell of rain in January, Daphne Major suffered a severe drought. Almost all the greenery disappeared from the island, and the\nonly plants that survived the drought were cactus bushes. The finches fed on seeds of all sizes. The small and medium-sized seeds\ndisappeared very soon, and the finches were then left with only large and hard seeds. But only the finches with larger beaks could\n\nbreak open these larger seeds; finches with small and medium-sized beaks could not open these seeds and so starved and perished.\n\nThe island was inhabited mainly by two species. At the start of 1977, there were about 1,200 Geospiza fortis and 280\nGeospiza scandens. By the end of the year, only 180 fortis and 110 scandens were left. About 85 percent of the fortis and 60 percent\nof the scandens had succumbed to the drought.\n\nThe Grants\u2019 data showed that the surviving fortis were, on average, 5 to 6 percent larger than the ones that had died. The\naverage beak length of the survivors was 11.07 millimeters compared to 10.68 millimeters for the species before the drought; the\n\naverage beak depth had increased from 9.42 millimeters to 9.96 millimeters. These differences may appear small to us, but they\n\f"}, "002014.png": {"text": "can tilt the balance between life and death in the wild. For example, a fortis with a beak length of 11 millimeters can crack a seed\nfrom a plant called a caltrop, but an individual with a beak length of 10.5 millimeters will not even attempt to do so. Just half a mil-\nlimeter can make all the difference.\n\nThe intensity of natural selection the Grants observed wasn\u2019t limited just to beak length and depth. At the start of 1977,\nthere were 600 male and 600 female fortis. By the end of the drought, more than 150 males and only a few females were alive. The\nmales are typically larger than the females by about 5 percent, so the males were more likely to survive. There were now six males\nto every female.\n\nNatural selection can occur in a single generation, but evolution takes place only over many generations. Given the dramatic\nchange in the beak size and sex ratio of the finches, natural selection had happened. But what about evolution? The Grants had to\nwait one more year to measure the beak size and shape of the offspring of the drought survivors of 1977. But then, they saw evolu-\n\ntion in action, too\u2014the new generation was 4 to 5 percent larger than the population before the onset of the drought.\n\nThey soon realized that their observation of 1977 was not a fluke. In 1983, there was a very heavy rainfall because of El\nNirio, and the island became lush and green. Green vines covered even the cactus bushes. This changed vegetation had a signifi-\ncant impact two years later when drought struck again. This time, tiny seeds were abundant (produced by the vines of 1983), and\nlarge seeds became rare. As a result, the finches with large beaks found it hard to pick up the seeds, and a large proportion of the\nsurvivors of this drought were the small-beaked finches. Their offspring, as a result, also had smaller beaks. Natural selection and\nevolution were evident again, except that, unlike in 1977, the beaks had evolved to become smaller.\n\nThus, in less than a decade, the finches\u2019 beak size increased and then decreased because of natural selection. When observed\nover a decade, beak size may not have appeared to change that much, but it had fluctuated significantly in the intervening period\nowing to the two extreme climate events.\n\nThe Grants published the results of their long-term study of the evolution of the two species of finches\u2014fortis and scandens\n\n\u2014in Science in April 2002 under the title \u201cUnpredictable Evolution in a 30-Year Study of Darwin\u2019s Finches.\u201d Before starting their\n\f"}, "002015.png": {"text": "research, they had hypothesized that the body traits of the finches would vary within a narrow band over the period of the study.\nBut as they say at the beginning of the article, \u201cThe data do not support the expectation of no change.\u201d\n\nIf you examine the graphs of the body size, beak size, and beak shape of fortis and scandens in the Grants\u2019 article, you will\nnotice the inverse correlation between the measurement period and the pace of evolution pointed out by Kurt\u00e9n in brown bears.\nThus, while the body size of fortis fluctuated a lot between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, the overall change over those two\ndecades was small. Similarly, the annual variation of the beak size of scandens appeared to be much greater than the variation from\nthe mid-1970s until the early 2000s. The beak shape of fortis was practically the same when measured in the mid-1980s and the\nearly 2000s, but its annual change was much more significant.\n\nThere is a lovely fractal-like property to this phenomenon. It does not seem to matter if the measurement period is thou-\nsands of years (bears) or just a few decades (finches). The pace of evolution speeds up over shorter periods and slows down over\n\nmore extended periods.\n\nBut so what?

However, I know that the daily, weekly, monthly, and quar-\nterly rate of change in exceptional businesses appears much greater than the rate of change measured over years and decades.\nThis realization has helped me formulate an investing principle that I call the Grant-Kurt\u00e9n principle of investing (GKPI). It\n\ngoes as follows:\n\f"}, "002016.png": {"text": "When we find high-quality businesses that do not fundamentally alter their character over the long term, we should exploit\n\nthe inevitable short-term fluctuations in their businesses for buying and not selling.\n\nGKPI requires us to own high-quality businesses that do not fundamentally alter their character over the long term. \u201cHigh-qual-\nity businesses\u201d is a loaded term and can mean different things to different investors. If you have come this far, I assume you know\nour definition. For us, the critical character traits of a high-quality business are stellar operating and financial track records, a sta-\n\nble industry, a high governance standard, a defensible moat, increasing market share, and low business and financial risk.\nHow do we use GKPI for buying? By exploiting short-term fluctuations.\n\nWe are highly demanding. We want a company to be run by an honest management team, and show solid operating and\nfinancial track records over many years. It needs to stay ahead of the competition and be debt free, and we also want it to keep\ntaking calculated risks while not unduly burdening the business. And, as if all these demands were not enough, we dare to insist\non a fair price for these rare gems! How is this even possible? The market should almost never offer us an attractive price for such a\n\nbusiness, and it doesn\u2019t.\n\nHowever, on rare occasions, investors who don\u2019t subscribe to GKPI succumb to the pressure of temporary macro, industry, or\ncompany issues, and we can then swoop in to buy a piece of an exceptional company. It doesn\u2019t\u2014and shouldn\u2019t\u2014happen often, but\n\nwhen it does, we go all in.\n\nTake WNS, one of our largest investments to date. It is one of India\u2019s leading business process outsourcing (BPO) companies\nand is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It was set up in 1996 as a captive back office by British Airways and started serving\nthird-party clients in 1999. In 2002, Warburg Pincus acquired a controlling stake in WNS. (I wasn\u2019t involved in the deal.) Although\nBritish Airways contributed to about 90 percent of WNS\u2019s revenues at the time of acquisition by Warburg Pincus in 2002, its rev-\nenue share had fallen to less than 10 percent by early 2008. The management at WNS had done a stellar job of diversifying away\n\nfrom British Airways and the travel industry. By outsourcing back-office functions like finance and accounting, mortgage process-\n\f"}, "002017.png": {"text": "ing, and customer analytics, WNS\u2019s clients typically get higher-quality service (e.g., faster turnaround times, lower error rates) at a\nmuch lower cost.\n\nIn January 2008, the stock price of WNS fell sharply from a previous high of $35 to $13. Three factors seemed to have\ncontributed to this steep correction. First, one of its large mortgage lender clients, First Magnus, declared bankruptcy in late 2007\nowing to the ongoing subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. First Magnus had contributed to about 5 percent of WNS\u2019s\nrevenue, so the management lowered its revenue guidance for the next year. Second, the management indicated that it may lose\nAviva, a large insurance client that was contributing to about 8 percent of WNS\u2019s revenue, by May 2008 if Aviva were to acquire the\nWNS facility servicing it. And third, the appreciating rupee had the analysts worried since most of WNS's delivery presence was in\nIndia. (A stronger rupee could make WNS less competitive and squeeze margins.)\n\nThe question for us was this: Was this a temporary blip, or was it a more permanent decline of achievable revenue and profit\ngrowth? We decided it was the former. The loss of First Magnus wasn\u2019t WNS'\u2019s fault, and even the potential loss of Aviva would be\ndue to Aviva\u2019s change of strategy, not because WNS wasn't serving it well. Also, we didn\u2019t believe WNS\u2019s long-term competitive\nadvantage would be adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations. WNS\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 64 percent from 2004\nto 2007 was proof that it offered high-quality back-office processing services to its clients at competitive prices.\n\nAlso, we love the Indian BPO industry. It is lucrative for well-established incumbents because it has high entry barriers for\nnew entrants (businesses are extremely wary of outsourcing their mission critical applications to a start-up) and high exit barriers\nfor existing clients (WNS and other leading players almost never lose a customer given the sticky nature of back-office process-\ning). Iassume you have heard the song \u201cHotel California\u201d by the Eagles. The song's last line, \u201cYou can check out any time you like,\nbut you can never leave,\u201d applies to the clients of the leading companies in the Indian BPO industry. WNS was\u2014and is\u2014in a great\nplace.\n\nThe bottom line was that despite the market pessimism, we had no reason to believe that anything fundamental had\n\nchanged at the company.\n\f"}, "002018.png": {"text": "We bought aggressively and invested $41 million in early 2008 at an average price of $15.2 per share. By March 2022, the\nstock price ($85.5) had gained 462 percent, whereas the Indian indexes (the Sensex as well as the Midcap Index) had gained only\n\n97 percent in dollars.\n\nThen, almost exactly twelve years after our initial investment in WNS in early 2008, we got an opportunity to buy again\nduring the early days of pandemic panic from March to May 2020.

But it is a tribute to the proper application of GKPI. You would have done spec-\n\ntacularly well by doing nothing.\n\nGKPI is our religion. And it reflects in all kinds of big and small ways in the way we work. Our office doesn\u2019t have a TV screen\nplaying CNBC or any other news; our lone TV screen is used only for video conferencing. The only Bloomberg terminal we have\nis in the corner of our office pantry; it remains unused and unwatched probably 99 percent of the time. We never discuss recent\ncompany news or share prices in our team meetings. I mainly read physical newspapers, in which the information is always one\nday late. We have never bought or sold a single business based on news flow and never will.\n\nGKPI demands that we be lazy when buying and very lazy when selling. And so we are. It has led to some decent outcomes for\n\nus.\n\nIn June 2022, excluding purchases during the previous two years, we owned twenty-eight businesses.

However, our ad-\n\nherence to GKPI ensured that we didn\u2019t panic, exercised patience, and stayed lazy.\n\nWhy and When We Sell\n\nIf GKPI requires that we not sell, then why do we?\n\nWe don\u2019t sell on valuation, a key reason many investors throw up their hands and exit. That is because we have no target\nprice for selling in our portfolio. I have sold on valuation. Only once. I behaved foolishly and regret it even today. I will discuss this\n\nfolly in chapter 10, so let\u2019s ignore it for the moment.\n\nWe sell under the following three conditions (the numbers in parentheses indicate the number of businesses sold):\n\n1. A decline in governance standards (0)\n2. Egregiously wrong capital allocation (3)\n\n3. Irreparable damage to the business (6)\n\nWe have sold ten businesses since 2007 (the nine listed here plus the mistake). I am excluding three businesses that strategic\n\nbuyers acquired. This translates to one exit every one and a half years. How\u2019s that for laziness?\n\nAs you can see, six of our nine exits occurred because we believed the business had been damaged beyond repair. And how\n\ndid we come to that conclusion? An example can clarify.\n\f"}, "002022.png": {"text": "We had invested in an old-world manufacturing business that was the leader in an oligopolistic industry in India. It ticked\nall the boxes\u2014enviable governance standard, impeccable financials, stable industry, zero leverage, and we were able to buy at what\nwe thought was an attractive price. Everything was hunky-dory for the first couple years. However, in the third year of our owner-\nship, we were surprised to see that the business lost market share for two quarters in a row. We spent time with the management\nto understand the reasons, and after some initial resistance, they agreed that there might have been some temporary share loss.\nHowever, they were confident that this was a transitory phenomenon.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t. The company kept losing market share, and in one of the smaller (but highly profitable) segments, its share\nloss accelerated over the next few quarters. Again, the management seemed to have a compelling set of explanations, all of which\nsounded logical. They claimed they had made many changes to their manufacturing, sales, and marketing practices and that we\nwould see the trend reverse soon. But the loss of market share continued. We waited for three more years after spotting the initial\ntrouble and finally decided to pull the plug. Since we want to be permanent owners, we demand a high performance standard in\nboth absolute and relative terms. When we exited, this business was delivering decent results: about 35 percent ROCE with modest\n\nrevenue and profit growth. But we did not want to be owners in a business that consistently fell behind the competition.\n\nDuring those three years of waiting for the business to improve, several positive and negative news reports were made about\nthe company. We ignored the news and focused on the trend in actual market share. Why did we hold the business for three more\nyears after detecting the problem? Why did we not sell sooner? Because GKPI tells us that we should expect ups and downs in\nevery business. There isn\u2019t a single business in our portfolio that has gone up ina straight line. Not one. Over the long run, most\nbusinesses in our portfolio have done well, but every business has gyrated wildly in both directions when measured over weeks or\nquarters. Our default option is to overlook these temporary business upheavals.\n\nHowever, in some cases, like the one I\u2019ve discussed here, what we think is temporary becomes more permanent. Fortunately,\n\nthere have been only six such occasions in our history.

Or Can It?\n\nWe apply evolutionary thinking by ignoring both small and big setbacks in our businesses to focus on the long term. Despite the\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al example and our experience applying GKPI, the skeptical part of your brain should raise two valid questions: (1) How long\nis \u201clong term,\u201d and (2) since new businesses keep destroying old ones, won't we be left with only failed businesses after a few\n\ndecades if we keep holding on?\n\nA headline on the website of the American Enterprise Institute from October 2015 can help us answer these questions. It\nreads, \u201cFortune 500 Firms in 1955 v. 2015: Only 12% Remain, Thanks to the Creative Destruction That Fuels Economic Prosper-\n\nity.\u201d2 The article goes on to list the sixty-one U.S. companies that had survived sixty years on the list.\n\nContrary to the article\u2019s tone, which mourns the seemingly significant Schumpeterian destruction, I was pleasantly sur-\nprised that sixty-one companies had stayed on the list for sixty years. I would have guessed the number to be much smaller. The\nperiod from 1955 to 2015 was tumultuous and unpredictable for the United States and the world. Also, the world of 2015 seemed\n\nalmost unrecognizable from that of 1955.\n\nDuring those sixty years, we witnessed the start and the end of the Cold War, the splintering of the USSR, the advent of the\nspace age, the U.S. Civil Rights Act, the oil shock, the savings and loans crisis, multiple crises in the Middle East, the meteoric rise of\nChina, the formation of the European Union, the internet boom and bust, the exponential growth of mobile phones, innumerable\nwars across the globe, the global financial crisis of 2008, the increasing dominance of technology firms, and the rapid digitization\n\nof all businesses.

However, companies like 3M, Alcoa, Avon, Caterpillar, Kellogg, Pepsi, Pfizer, and many others did much better\nthan simply endure these massive local and global shocks\u2014they also prospered by maintaining their position in the top five hun-\n\ndred companies in the country.\n\nBut this number, sixty-one, was understated. First, there was a factual error. The author missed eleven businesses that ap-\npeared on both lists, companies including Colgate-Palmolive, Corning, H. J. Heinz, and PPG. It was probably just an oversight. Thus,\n\nseventy-two companies should appear on both lists.\n\nThe second reason for understatement was that the author did not count the businesses that had been acquired by a Fortune\n500 business between 1955 and 2015. Let\u2019s take Gillette. In 2005, P&G acquired Gillette for $57 billion (Gillette remained a For-\ntune 500 business for fifty years after 1955; its rank was 215 when it was acquired). Should we consider Gillette to be a \u201cfailure\u201d?\nWas it \u201ccreatively destroyed\u201d? I don\u2019t think so. I used their overpriced blades just this morning. Since it was a part of P&G, which\n\nwas ranked 32 on the Fortune 500 list of 2015, I would also consider Gillette to be on the Fortune 500 list of 2015.\n\nUnited Technologies acquired Otis in 1975 (and so Otis stayed on the list for twenty years after 1955). United Technologies\nwas ranked 45 on the 2015 Fortune 500 list, and I could reasonably argue that Otis should be counted as a continuing business as\na part of United Technologies. We can reach the same conclusion for businesses like Wrigley, Quaker Oats, Carrier, Bestfoods, and\nMcDonnell Douglas, acquired by the Fortune 500 companies Berkshire Hathaway, PepsiCo, United Technologies, Unilever, and Boe-\ning, respectively.\n\nThere are seventy-three companies like Gillette and Otis from the Fortune 500 list of 1955 acquired by the Fortune 500\ncompanies of 2015. Here, I have also included the larger overseas acquirers like BP and Unilever, who, if they were in the United\nStates, would have been a part of the Fortune 500 in 2015. Thus, one hundred forty-five businesses from 1955 could be included\n\non the 2015 list: seventy-two that survived and seventy-three that have become part of the survivors.\n\nFrom 1955, sixty-three companies either went bankrupt or were untraceable (finding companies from the 1950s and 1960s\n\nis not easy). They were a part of the destruction process of capitalism.\n\f"}, "002025.png": {"text": "What happened to the remaining two hundred ninety-two businesses (500 - 145 - 63) from the Fortune 500 list of 1955?\nThey either fell out of the top 500 or were acquired by or merged with other companies.

There are a Jot of high-quality businesses that\naren\u2019t in the Fortune 500, which, by definition, is a highly restrictive list.\n\nFor example, Eaton ranked 189 in 1955 and fell out of the Fortune 500 in 2013. In June 2021, its market value was $60\nbillion. So I wouldn\u2019t label it as a failure. Also, it stayed on the list for fifty-eight years after 1955, which is no mean achievement.\nBorden Chemical was acquired by the private equity giants KKR in 1995 and then by Apollo in 2004. Borden exists even today as\npart of Hexion Specialty Chemicals.

Any-\n\nway, let\u2019s stick with it.\n\nWe can safely assume that the 1955 Fortune 500 businesses were high-quality businesses. Of course, they may not have\nbeen high quality strictly according to our definition (e.g., some may have had modest debt levels). But there is no denying that\nthey were extraordinary companies\u2014they couldn\u2019t have become some of the largest businesses in the mecca of capitalism with-\nout being outstanding.\n\nWe have seen that at least 30 percent (72 + 73 = 145) of these continued to be high quality as evidenced by remaining in the\ntop 500 for sixty years. If we include companies that may have done well over this period despite not being part of the elite 500 in\nthe year 2015 (about sixty to seventy-five businesses), we see that 40 to 45 percent (two hundred five to two hundred twenty) of\ncompanies from the 1955 Fortune 500 list performed well over sixty years.

First, \u201clong term\u201d is genuinely long term: at\nleast five decades, maybe more.

But this is not what they find. Instead, before and since Darwin, a large number of paleontologists have found that the ma-\n\njority of species appear suddenly in the fossil record and then persist unchanged until they go extinct.2\n\nHugh Falconer (1808-1865) was one of the greatest paleontologists of the nineteenth century.2 He went to India as a\nsurgeon in 1830 but spent most of his time digging up fossils. He discovered ancient fossil beds in the southern Himalayas and\nexcavated several extinct species like the mastodon and saber-toothed tiger. He also studied the fossils of European elephants. Dar-\n\nwin had colossal respect for Falconer and sent him a copy of the first edition of Origin in November 1859 with a personal note.\n\nFalconer discovered that most fossil species remained stable over very long periods, even through significant environmental\nchanges. In his 1863 monograph, after describing that the mammoths had experienced extreme changes of climate, he wonders,\n\u201cIf species are so unstable, and so susceptible to mutations through such influences, why does that extinct form stand out so sig-\n\nnally, amonument of stability?\u201d\n\nIn 1903, the famous paleontologist H. F. Cleland noted a similar stasis in Devonian fossils (from 420 to 360 million years\nago). He stated, \u201cA careful examination of the fossils of all the zones, from the lowest to the highest, failed to reveal any evolution-\n\nary changes, with the possible exception of Ambocoelia praeumbona. ...

In the authors\u2019 words, \u201cAs a central proposition, punctuated equilibrium holds\nthat the great majority of species, as evidenced by their anatomical and geographical histories in the fossil record, originate in geo-\n\nlogical moments (punctuations) and then persist in stasis throughout their long durations.\u201d\n\f"}, "002035.png": {"text": "Gould and Eldredge were admonishing their peers for confusing an \u201cabsence of evidence\u201d with \u201cevidence of absence.\u201d Gould\n(who died in 2002) was a paleontologist at Harvard University and conducted extensive research on West Indian land snails.\nEldredge, now curator emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History, specialized in trilobites (which are now extinct).\nPaleontologists study fossils to learn about an organism\u2019s evolutionary history and its relationship to other organisms and its\nenvironment. In fact, until the rise of modern DNA extraction techniques, paleontology was the only science capable of studying\nancient life. But even the latest and most modern DNA extraction techniques can study samples of only up to about a million years\n\nold.5 So fossils, and hence paleontology, are our only reliable window onto the ancient past.\n\nGould and Eldredge\u2019s brilliant insight pointed out what may seem obvious now: The gaps in the fossil record were not a bug\nbut a vital feature of the evolution of species. They declared that when paleontologists found a sudden change in the morphology\nof a particular species, they should assume that there had been a sudden change in morphology and not make the Darwinian error\n\nof trying to explain away this sudden change by invoking gaps in the fossil record.\n\nAccording to them, the absence of evidence of intermediate forms is evidence of their absence.

He showed that sharp morphological differences in these three species, as measured by differences\nin color, the form of their spire, the thickness of the shell, and the shape of the apertural lip, did not arise gradually. Instead, they\ncame about owing to a punctuation event of allopatric speciation (i.e., a new species arising as a result of the geographic isola-\ntion of a small group of individuals from their parent species).

Kurt\u00e9n had shown that the rate of change in organisms is higher over the short term and is lower over the long\nterm. But the theory of punctuated equilibrium asserts that living things change dramatically (i.e., create new species)\nafter a long period of stasis. What\u2019s going on? If you read carefully, you will notice that these theories actually comple-\nment each other.\n\nKurt\u00e9n\u2019s observations were for a single species over thousands of years, and the changes observed were within rea-\nsonable limits. The Grants\u2019 beak measurements were spread over a few decades, and the variations in beak size and shape\nweren't so drastic as to warrant the creation of a new species. Eldredge and Gould, on the other hand, discuss the process\nof the creation of a new species after the original species has been in stasis for millions of years. Both views are correct\u2014\n\nthey are explaining different phenomena over different periods.\n\nIn his research article published in 1985, A. L. A. Johnson studied thirty-four scallop species from the Jurassic period (from\n200 to 145 million years ago) and found copious evidence of stasis as well as an example of abrupt speciation.\u2018 He concluded, \u201cOne\n\ncase... was discovered where... the sudden appearance of a descendant form could fairly be ascribed to rapid evolution (within\n\f"}, "002037.png": {"text": "no more than one million years).

Alan H.\nCheetham of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC, is an expert on bryozoan fossils. (Bryozoa\nare tiny animals that look like worms and have tentacles on the outside; they live in colonies that resemble trees or flowers.) He\nstarted his work on the bryozoan species Metrarabdotos to illustrate gradualism.? Cheetham measured forty-six characters in sev-\nenteen species of Metrarabdotos over fifteen million years. He found that eleven of the seventeen species persisted unchanged for\ntwo to six million years, followed by a punctuational change over 160,000 years. Cheetham emphasized \u201cthe remarkably clear-cut\n\nevidence for a punctuated evolutionary pattern in these Metrarabdotos species.\u201d\n\nMany such studies have found evidence of punctuated equilibrium. One of the most interesting\u2014and conclusive\u2014was\nreported in the Proceedings of the Royal Society in 2008 by Tiina Mattila and Folmer Bokma from Umea University in Sweden.\nInstead of examining fossil records, Mattila and Bokma analyzed the change in body mass of 2,143 mammal species of a total of\n4,510 extant species to assess whether their evolution was punctuated or gradual. They concluded, \u201cOur Bayesian estimates from\nmammals as well as separate sub-clades such as primates and carnivores suggest that gradual evolution is responsible for only a\nsmall part of the body size variation between mammal species.\u201d Their study confirmed that punctuated equilibrium played a big\npart in the evolution of most mammal species\u2019 body mass. Most research on punctuated equilibrium\u2014including that by Gould and\nEldredge\u2014typically focuses on one species at a time.

The critics of punctuated equilibria accuse Gould and Eldredge of reviving the discredited mutationism theory of\nHugo de Vries and the macromutation theory of Richard Goldschmidt. Goldschmidt, a German-born American zoologist, argued\nin his book The Material Basis of Evolution in 1940 that species were created not by accumulating minor variations but through\nsignificant mutations (called saltations) in a single generation. However, the scientific community has discredited this theory of\n\nsudden evolution, derisively termed the \u201ctheory of hopeful monsters.\u201d\n\nGould has rightly argued in many of his writings that punctuated equilibrium is not saltation. The theory was written for\npaleontologists who understand that \u201cinstantaneous\u201d refers to geological time, spanning tens of thousands of years, and should\nnot be confused with human time scales. In his book The Structure of Evolutionary Theory, Gould uses the analogy of human gesta-\ntion: \u201cAs the gestation time of a human being represents 1 to 2 percent of an ordinary lifetime, perhaps we should permit the same\ngeneral range for punctuational speciation relative to later duration in stasis. At an average lifetime of four million years, a 1-per-\n\ncent criterion allows forty thousand years of speciation.\u201d\n\nA bizarre unintended consequence of the brouhaha among biologists was that the creationists crashed their party!12 Cre-\nationists have always used the lack of intermediate forms in the fossil record as evidence that Darwin's theory is wrong. The idea\nof punctuated equilibrium seemed to substantiate their claim when Gould and Eldredge emphasized that \u201cstasis is data.\u201d Creation-\nists believe that animals and plants emerge suddenly in the fossil record because they were created instantaneously by God; thus,\nthey took refuge in the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which seemed to affirm the sudden emergence of species.\n\nGould was scathing in his takedown of the creationists with the following choice words: \u201c... punctuated equilibrium\nprovides an even easier target for this form of intellectual dishonesty (or crass stupidity if a charge of dishonesty grants them too\n\nmuch acumen), no one should be surprised that our views have become grist for their mills and skills of distortion.\u201d\n\f"}, "002039.png": {"text": "Iam not an evolutionary biologist, but as I said in the introduction, one of the skills I possess is the ability to read.

An apparent 3 percent \u201csuccess rate.\u201d The actual number is probably\ncloser to 1 to 2 percent or even lower. Thus, 97 to 99 percent of the not-so-great businesses could not \u201csucceed\u201d over sixty years.\nStasis is the default.\n\nI know I have been unfair here. To count listing among the Fortune 500 as a measure of \u201csuccess\u201d is undoubtedly an unrea-\nsonable demand. Many of the ten thousand businesses of 1955 may have achieved great success without necessarily becoming\ntoo large\u2014they may have focused much more on profits or may have been merged or acquired, creating massive value for share-\nholders. My intention here was to demonstrate directionally that great businesses remain great much longer than we think. The\n\nprobability that a not-so-great business becomes excellent over time is infinitesimal.\n\f"}, "002044.png": {"text": "Our investment strategy is thus quite simple:\n\n1. Since the vast majority of businesses do not become great, our default strategy is not to buy. We are lazy buyers.\n2. We buy only if we can find a high-quality business that can stay in stasis over decades. If we believe we have such a business,\n\nwe don\u2019t sell. We are very lazy sellers.\n\nPart III: A Conclusion from Climbing Concentration\n\nIn an article from the July 2019 issue of Review of Finance, Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely ask, \u201cAre U.S. industries becoming more\nconcentrated?\u201d.3 It turns out to be a rhetorical question: Of course they are. The authors demonstrate this with copious data. Their\narticle shows two trends occurring from 1997 to 2014 that seem to reinforce each other: (1) Since the 1990s, in over three-quar-\nters of U.S. industries, the market share of the leading players has increased, and (2) these companies show higher profit margins\n\nand provide higher returns to shareholders, which, in turn, allows them to increase their market power even more.\n\nWhile the article does not state so explicitly, it is also evident that the market power of smaller and less powerful businesses\nhas declined over this period. The authors show that not only did the revenue share of the four largest public and private compa-\nnies in almost every industry increase but also that the average size of the leading companies also tripled in real terms during the\n\nperiod of measurement.\n\nAnd this is not a recent phenomenon. It turns out that the specter of increasing market power among the more extensive\nand more successful businesses has haunted the corporate world since the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1977, Leslie\nHannah andJ. A. Kay published Concentration in Modern Industry: Theory, Measurement, and the U.K. Experience. Hannah and Kay\ndemonstrate the inexorable rise of the biggest firms\u2019 market share in the United States and the United Kingdom from the early\n\n1900s to the mid-1970s. The first graph in the book tracks the share of the largest hundred firms in manufacturing net output\n\f"}, "002045.png": {"text": "during this period. Over seventy years, the market share of these firms rose from 15 percent to 50 percent in the United Kingdom\nand from 20 percent to more than 30 percent in the United States. Hannah and Kay claimed increasing market power (which cuts\nacross industries) and not increasing industry concentration (which measures the increasing power of companies within an in-\ndustry). Ideally, I would like to demonstrate greater industry concentration to make my case, but it is still instructive to note the\n\nlonger-term success of the largest firms in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nAJanuary 2019 OECD working paper titled \u201cIndustry Concentration in Europe and North America\u201d presents evidence for\nthe increasing power of more successful firms quite emphatically.14 Between 2001 and 2012, the largest 10 percent of companies\nin the average industry in ten European countries increased their market share by 2 to 3 percentage points. In the United States,\nthe increase in market share of the leading firms of the average industry between 2000 and 2014 was 4 to 8 percentage points. The\npaper also clarifies that the numbers were not driven by digital-intensive sectors (e.g., search engines, social media, e-commerce)\nbut by old-world manufacturing and services firms.\n\nIn March 2016, the Economist magazine's cover bemoaned, \u201cWinners Take All: Why High Profits Are a Problem for Amer-\nica.\u201d15 Of course, I am not qualified to pass judgment on the appropriateness of the sky-high profits of giant corporations, but Ido\n\u2018want to quote the magazine\u2019s view on the stasis of businesses.\n\nThe article discusses three key reasons\u2014technology, globalization, and decline in trade union membership\u2014for profit accu-\nmulation among the more successful firms and then follows with the following: \u201cNone of these accounts though, explain the most\ntroubling aspect of America\u2019s profit problem: its persistence.\u201d It mentions that a highly profitable firm in 2003 had an 83 percent\nchance of being very profitable in 2013. A powerful visual plot of the share of the top four companies in 893 industry sectors from\n\n1997 to 2012 clearly shows the increasing power of larger businesses.\n\nThe summary of all this research on industry and market concentration is as follows:\n\n1. There are a few large and successful firms in most industries.\n\f"}, "002046.png": {"text": "2. These successful companies are becoming even more successful.\n\n3. Weak companies are getting weaker.\n\nNumbers 1 and 2 are direct conclusions of the research, and number 3 is an indirect but logical outcome of 1 and 2.\n\nAs I wrote earlier, our investing experience in India is not different from what research from the United States, the United\nKingdom, or Europe says. Our investee companies have been gaining share over the competition over decades. Some examples are\nBerger in the paint industry, Supreme in plastic pipes, Voltamp in industrial transformers, Page in innerwear, Havells and V-Guard\nin consumer electricals, Amara Raja in batteries, Info Edge in job boards, MRF in tires, and Ratnamani in specialty steel pipes.\n\nIn India, too, great businesses continue to be great, and poor businesses continue to suffer. The observation that \u201cstasis is the\ndefault\u201d does not respect national boundaries.\n\nAs permanent owners, we want to own successful businesses that will maintain their rewarding run. That sounds straight-\nforward, but the problem is that there are very few successful businesses. Throwing a dart at the business landscape will land us in\n\nreal trouble. So we don\u2019t. We invest rarely.\n\nWe should not sell once we own a \u201cwinner\u201d like Havells or Ratnamani since it will likely keep gaining market share. So we\n\ndon\u2019t. We sell even more rarely than we buy.\n\nPart IV: The Narrative of a Ninety-Year Study\n\nIn May 2018, Hendrik Bessembinder of the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University published an article titled \u201cDo\nStocks Outperform Treasury Bills?\u201d!s He analyzed the price performance of about 26,000 common stocks listed on the New York\n\nStock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and the NASDAQ from 1926 to 2016.\n\f"}, "002047.png": {"text": "Unsurprisingly, 51 percent of these stocks lost their entire value over their lifetime. The majority of businesses should not\nbe in business. Bessembinder\u2019s research demonstrates that since the average common stock will lose its value over time, owning\nstocks can harm one\u2019s wealth. Our default position should be not to buy. So we don't. We are lazy.\n\nCan you guess the number of those 26,000 stocks, if purchased in 1926 and held until 2016 (or acquired or merged), that\nbeat the market? The answer is about 8,000, or about 31 percent of the universe.!2 Again, I was surprised at how high this number\nwas. Remember that we are talking about the companies not just doing well but beating the market over 90 years (or until they\nwere merged or acquired). These great businesses maintained their greatness over a very long period. Stasis was the default for\n\nthem. Once we own such a business, selling would border on being sinful.\n\nStock Price Fluctuation Is Not Business Punctuation\n\nAcritical element of the theory of punctuated equilibrium is that fluctuation is not punctuation. During long periods of stasis, the\ncharacter traits of living organisms do vary but within limits.\n\nAcritical element of our investment philosophy is that we do not confuse stock price fluctuation with business punctuation.\nDuring long periods of business stasis, stock prices vary, but the character of excellent businesses tends to stay within limits.\n\nAs Gould clarifies, \u201cStasis does not imply absolute stability, but rather directionless fluctuation that generally does not stray\nbeyond the boundaries of geographic variation within similar species and, particularly, does not trend in any given direction, espe-\ncially towards the modal morphology of descendant forms.\u201d The character traits of species do fluctuate while they are in stasis, but\nthey are range bound.\n\nThere is a tendency among investors to interpret stock price movement as the measure of business direction. Shouldn't it be\nthe other way around? Does the cart drive the horse? You bet it does, more often than you can imagine. And it does strange things\n\nto even the best of us. Our community can and does accord a level of priority to ticker symbols that they don\u2019t deserve.\n\f"}, "002048.png": {"text": "Here is a true story. A venture capitalist (VC) friend and I were meeting for lunch one afternoon in Mumbai. As you may\nknow, VCs invest in start-ups and early-stage privately held businesses. Every few minutes, he would glance at his phone and then\nreturn to our conversation. I had known him for more than a decade but had never witnessed this odd behavior before. After a few\nminutes, I became mildly irritated and asked him the reason for his distraction. He apologized and sheepishly remarked that two\nof his portfolio companies had gone public in the past two weeks. After that, he said he felt compelled to check their stock prices\n\nevery few minutes. He admitted that he couldn\u2019t help himself.\n\nMy friend is an intelligent guy. He knows that the business of his listed portfolio companies is not changing by the minute.\nA few weeks earlier, when the companies were unlisted, he hardly ever thought about them. But now that they each had a stock\nexchange ticker that gyrated a few percentage points every day, he had gotten caught up in the action. Now imagine if he were\nrunning a public market fund like ours in which every portfolio company is listed. That may have driven him up the wall, which is\nwhat happens to many in our community.\n\nA great example of stock prices getting the upper hand is provided by Amazon. The company had its IPO in May 1997 at $18.\nBy December 1998, when dot-com mania was sweeping through the U.S. markets, the stock had climbed almost fourteen times to\n$243. The star analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer, Henry Blodget, published a price target of $400 within twelve months.12 The stock\npromptly jumped almost 20 percent to $289 in one day. In January 1999, Blodget wrote, \u201cUnlike with other famous bubbles... the\nInternet bubble is riding on rock-solid fundamentals, perhaps stronger than any the market has seen before.\u201d Well, where was the\nevidence? None of the rising dot-com stars was even close to earning any profit; worse, they were burning cash as if the market\nfaucet would remain open forever. The only empirical evidence backing Blodget\u2019s claim of solid business fundamentals seemed to\nbe that the stock prices were rising.\n\nBy the time the dot-com bubble burst in the summer of 2000, Amazon had dropped more than 60 percent from its peak.\nRavi Suria, a young Lehman bond analyst, issued a withering twenty-seven-page report predicting that Amazon was doomed and\n\nthat if the company did not change its ways, it would be out of cash within a year.-2 In this highly bearish environment for all dot-\n\f"}, "002049.png": {"text": "coms, Amazon fell 19 percent in a single day. Bezos brushed the criticism aside, and Amazon kept doing its business the way it had\nalways done: by caring more about cash flow than profits. Suria had predicted that Amazon would be left with $125 million in the\nbank at the end of 2001; instead, Amazon ended the year with $1 billion. Amazon\u2019s bonds, which Suria had predicted would col-\nlapse, were up 50 percent.\n\nJust as Blodget had gained stardom by predicting that Amazon would keep rising, Suria became the darling of financial\npundits with his prediction that Amazon would fail. The only difference? Blodget was cheerleading when all stocks were rising,\n\nand Suria predicted doomsday in the middle of a catastrophic bear market.\n\nIt is unfair to pick on only Blodget and Suria. They were two among thousands of analysts and investors who got carried\naway by the rising and falling stock prices of the dot-com era. The saga repeated itself during the global financial crisis of 2008\nwhen the rising market capitalizations of highly leveraged lenders blinded most financial experts to the deepening malaise that\n\nfinally brought the global economy to its knees.\nIn my opinion, investors can commit two types of grave errors.\n\nFirst, they can treat an unfavorable stock price fluctuation as a negative business punctuation. This mindset compels the\ninvestor either to sell a good business or not to buy a good business when the price declines owing to a negative piece of news or\nevent. I covered this first error in the previous chapter when discussing the Grant-Kurt\u00e9n principle of investing (GKPI). As a re-\nminder, GKPI says the following: When we find high-quality businesses that do not fundamentally alter their character over the long\nterm, we should exploit the inevitable short-term fluctuations in their businesses for buying and not selling. Since chapter 8 addressed\nthis issue, let me not dwell any more on it here.\n\nThe second error is to regard a positive stock price fluctuation as positive business punctuation. Doing so can lead to buying\na lousy business (because it seems that things have permanently improved) or not selling one. Ask any long-term investor about\ntheir investment strategy, and almost all will proclaim that they buy and hold high-quality businesses. I doubt even one would\n\nadmit to buying poor-quality businesses to trade later at a higher price. They are not lying.

The valuations of private and public companies were soaring, and there seemed to be a consensus that the\ngold rush was beginning. Amid this infrastructure mania, Reliance Power launched an IPO in January 2008 that was oversub-\nscribed seventy-two times! It made the company\u2019s owner, Anil Ambani, the richest Indian. Despite having a power capacity of less\nthan 1,000 megawatts at the time of the IPO, the company\u2019s value was about $35 billion.

But most\nindustries and businesses don\u2019t fall neatly into this category. So what do we do when we see increasing valuation in businesses or\n\nindustries that we haven't encountered before?\n\nWe ignore the hype around valuation and focus exclusively on business quality. I have devoted the whole of section II to this\ntopic, so let me confine this discussion to an example.\n\nTable 9.1 includes the news item \u201cThe Education Sector Will Grow at 7.5% to $144 Billion by 2020.\u201d This headline is from\nlate 2017 when many new-age education companies (appropriately christened \u201cEdTech\u201d in India had started getting funded at\nunheard-of valuations in the private market.\n\nWe don\u2019t know ofa single listed education business in India that has made money over the long term.

When I assess the finances of listed education\nbusinesses in a large market like the United States, I find that most don\u2019t earn even their cost of capital. For example, in 2021, the\nU.S. education company with the most considerable market value was Grand Canyon Education, whose market capitalization was\nonly about $4 billion.

But he didn\u2019t think so.\n\nOn July 29, 1828, the nineteen-year-old Charles Darwin wrote a letter to his close friend and second cousin, William Darwin\nFox. He started with a complaint and then rued his lack of mathematical prowess: \u201cWhat excuse have you to offer for not having\nanswered my letter long before this? I hope it is nothing worse than idleness; or what would be still better, I hope it arises from\nyour being ten fathoms deep in the Mathematics, and if you are God help you, for so am I, only with this difference I stick fast in the\nmud at the bottom and there I shall remain in status quo.\u201d2\n\nDarwin reiterated his weakness in mathematics in his autobiography: \u201cAfter years I have deeply regretted that I did not pro-\nceed far enough at least to understand something of the great leading principles of mathematics; for men thus endowed seem to\nhave an extra sense.\u201d He also admitted that the subject \u201cwas repugnant to me.\u201d3 He detested complex mathematical formulations\nand once wrote to a friend, \u201cI have no faith in anything short of actual measurement and the Rule of Three.\u201d The Rule of Three is a\n\nsimple mathematical calculation that answers the problem \u201cIf ten mangoes cost $8, how many mangoes can one buy for $40?\u201d\n\nI regard Darwin as a math genius because of his intuitive grasp of the prodigious power of long-term compounding. Most of\nhis peers didn\u2019t understand it; in fact, neither did many of his successors. In chapter 3 of Origin, \u201cStruggle for Existence,\u201d Darwin\u2019s\nexquisite grasp of the power of compounding is evident in his famous example of elephants. He wrote, \u201cThe elephant is reckoned\nto be the slowest breeder of all known animals, and I have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of increase: it\nwill be under the mark to assume that it breeds when thirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing forth\nthree pair of young in this interval; if this be so, at the end the of fifth century there would be alive fifteen million elephants, de-\nscended from the first pair.\u201d\n\nLike no one else before him, Darwin understood that an exponential increase of populations was theoretically possible but\n\npractically almost impossible\u2014diseases, predators, lack of food, natural disasters, and many other factors kept populations in\n\f"}, "002065.png": {"text": "check. This realization led him to conclude that only the fittest variants would survive to pass on their traits to their offspring.\nThese fitter variants would then start exponentially increasing, leading to evolution through natural selection. As he famously\nwrote in chapter 4 of Origin, \u201cThis preservation of favorable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural\n\nSelection.\u201d\n\nAs I discussed earlier, Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection had no place for sudden and dramatic changes. His theory\nrequired variations to be small and continuous and natural selection to work over very long periods through accumulated changes.\nDespite its glaring simplicity and explanatory power\u2014or maybe because of it\u2014his theory remained on the periphery of biological\n\nsciences during his lifetime and was not entirely accepted by the scientific community.t\n\nIn 1900, after the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel\u2019s work on heredity, Hugo de Vries, a well-respected Dutch botanist and\ngeneticist, proposed a new theory of evolution called mutationism.: According to this theory, the slight continuous variation\nproposed by Darwin could not lead to the evolution and creation of species; only significant mutations could. In his Die Mutations-\ntheorie (The Mutation Theory), de Vries claimed that new species arise suddenly owing to discontinuous alteration. He wrote, \u201cThe\n\nnew species thus originates suddenly[;] it is produced by the existing one without visible preparation and without transition.\u201ds\n\nNow that everyone could understand.

Everyone seems to know\nthat the stock price of AMC, a movie theater chain, tripled in May 2021, but how many know that Home Depot's multiplied 140\ntimes over thirty years from 1990 to 2020?\n\nAccording to mutationism, species are created not because of minor variations but because something big and strange hap-\npens that transforms the organism. The controversial debate between mutationism and Darwinism remained unresolved until\nthe 1920s. Finally, mathematics rescued biology (who would have thought!). In the 1920s and \u201930s, the theoretical geneticists R.\n\nA. Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane, Sewall Wright, and a few others explained in complex mathematical language how continuous variation\n\f"}, "002066.png": {"text": "was compatible with Mendel\u2019s laws. Natural selection, acting cumulatively on minor variations, could produce significant evolu-\n\ntionary changes over surprisingly short periods.2\nThese acknowledged mathematical geniuses restated what Darwin had asserted almost fifty years earlier.\n\nHe was saying that if a particular variation\u2014say color vision\u2014could give an individual a slight advantage over its peers,\nalmost the entire population would be able to see in color over many fewer generations than we would imagine. Let us assume that\ncolor vision has a \u201cselective advantage\u201d of 1 percent, meaning that individuals with this trait produce 101 viable offspring instead\nof 100 (maybe color vision allows the individuals to locate higher-quality fruits in the forest). Thus, the selective advantage here is\n\nequivalent to compound interest or annualized return. The advantage accumulates and grows exponentially over generations.\n\nThus, in the second generation, the 101 offspring with color vision produce 10,201 offspring who can see color (101 x 101),\nwhereas the 100 \u201cnormal\u201d offspring produce 10,000 \u201cnormal\u201d offspring (100 x 100). This slight advantage compounded at 1 per-\n\ncent per generation yields dramatic change over time.\n\nSuppose there are eight individuals with this trait (i.e., color vision) among a thousand individuals. Over how many gener-\nations do you think color vision would spread to 90 percent of the population? Only 3,000!2 Thus, if this were an organism with a\nlife span of one month, most of this species would have color vision within 250 years with just a 1 percent selective advantage. In\n\nevolutionary terms, this is almost instantaneous transformation. And this is not just theory.\n\nScientists observed the rapid evolution of peppered moths in Manchester in Britain in the nineteenth century.2 Peppered\nmoths were generally white with small black splotches on their wings. They rested on lichen-covered tree trunks during the day,\nwhere they were camouflaged against birds, their main predator. The species also had a rare, black-colored mutant. But it did not\nsurvive long because it was visible to birds against the background of tree trunks. As a result, most populations of peppered moths\nwere, well, peppered. But as Manchester became industrialized from the middle of the nineteenth century, air pollution blackened\ntree trunks, thereby reversing the advantage: The black mutant became invisible to birds, and the peppered form stood out. The\n\nfirst black peppered moth was recorded in Manchester in 1848, and by 1895, 98 percent of the population had become black. The\n\f"}, "002067.png": {"text": "cumulative impact of a slight advantage had converted the rare form into the dominant one. Interestingly, as Britain passed strict\npollution laws in the middle of the twentieth century, trees began to lose their sooty coating.

Unfortunately, the twenty-four rabbits released by Mr. Austin in Australia in 1859 did produce ten billion\nrabbits by 1925 and wreaked havoc on the flora and fauna of the continent.12 Despite more than one hundred fifty years of gov-\nernment efforts ranging from building fences, trapping, shooting, and conducting biological warfare (by releasing flies with the\n\ndeadly myxoma virus), Australia has been unable to eliminate this pest.\n\nI said that there were two surprises in this story. The small surprise, at least for me, is that twenty-four rabbits became ten\nbillion. At some intuitive level, we investors understand that compounding can lead to astronomical numbers given enough time.\nBut even then, I doubt many of us would have been able to envision a number of ten billion rabbits in the mid-1920s when there\n\nhad been fewer than a million in 1895.\n\nThe bigger surprise\u2014which is also counterintuitive\u2014is the opposite observation: Nothing happened for a very long time! After\ntwenty years, not many rabbits would have been visible in Australia, and even after forty-five years, there were fewer than two rab-\nbits per square kilometer. So Australians ignored the rabbit problem for many decades because rabbits did not become a problem.\n\nThis property of compounding\u2014that its impact seemingly remains hidden for a long time\u2014wreaks havoc on the perfor-\nmance of investors because most sell too soon. An investor can hold a great business for five years, multiply their money three\ntimes, and then sell off for two potential reasons.

As I said, the bigger mystery of compounding is\nnot that it leads to large numbers but that it doesn\u2019t do so for a long time.\n\nThe holding period of most funds is barely a few months, let alone years.

What could be better than that?\n\nReason 2: Empirical Evidence Shows That Owning Great Businesses Works (Oh, So Well!)\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the Bessembinder study I referred to in the previous chapter.12 As a reminder, Bessembinder analyzed the price\nperformance of 26,000 U.S.-listed stocks from 1926 to 2016. He also shares the raw data from 1926 to 2019, which is available at\nhttps://wpcarey.asu.edu/department-finance/faculty-research/do-stocks-outperform-treasury-bills.\n\nLet\u2019s look at data from 1926 to 2019. Bessembinder defines \u201cwealth creation\u201d as returns earned above one-month U.S. trea-\nsuries. Of the 26,000 companies, about 60 percent (15,000) destroyed value. This is not surprising: Running a business is risky,\nand the data support this assertion.\n\nBut I was surprised by two facts. First, the quantum of wealth creation is almost eight times the dollar value of wealth\ndestruction, although wealth destroyers outnumber wealth creators by almost 40 percent. About 11,000 companies created a\nwealth of $54 trillion, and about 15,000 businesses destroyed a wealth of $7 trillion (leading to a net wealth creation of $47 tril-\nlion). When businesses do well, the sky\u2019s the limit.\n\nMy second revelation was that only a select few companies created most of the wealth, even among the wealth creators\n\n(table 10.3).\n\nTABLE 10.3 Wealth creation is highly concentrated in a few businesses held for longer periods\n\n \n\nNo. of companies Wealth, \u00a2 trillion % of total Years held (median)\n\n \n\f"}, "002073.png": {"text": " \n\nTop 10% 2,617 52 110 25\nTop 1% 262 35 74 47\n\nTop 30 30 15 32 59\n\nThus, the top 10 percent, or about 2,600 companies, account for all (actually, 10 percent more) of the total wealth created\nby the 26,000 businesses. The top 1 percent contribute to three-quarters, and just thirty firms account for almost a third of total\n\nwealth created over ninety-three years.\n\nAn even more interesting finding is shown in the last column of table 10.3. A disproportionate amount of wealth is created\nby businesses that have been held for longer periods. That does not mean that simply holding a business for an extended period\ncreates value\u2014it does not; the value will almost certainly go to zero for an average business. Table 10.3 shows that if we have a\ngreat business, on average, it is likely to generate more incredible wealth over a more extended period.\n\nBut we have one prickly issue to deal with here: How do we know what a great business is so that we can hold it for as long as\npossible? (I hope you did not start reading the book from this chapter\u2014I discussed this question in chapters 1 through 7.)\n\nWe do not invest in mediocre or low-quality businesses at throw-away valuations because, as table 10.3 shows, it would be a\nwaste of time. Only a handful of companies create wealth over very long periods, and, by definition, all need to be exceptional. In-\nstead, we invest when we believe that the business is truly outstanding, and if it is, given the stark reality of table 10.3, why would\nwe ever sell it?\n\nI have been wrong about assessing the quality of some of our businesses. Since we hold all our businesses forever, the contin-\n\nuous compounding of earnings and value of a few businesses has taken care of all my follies. You want numbers? Comin\u2019 at you.\n\nReason 3: If There Is an Unbeatable Formula, Why Not Copy It?\n\f"}, "002074.png": {"text": "When I was at McKinsey, we addressed client problems by sharing \u201cbest practices.\u201d These could range from advice related to post-\nmerger integration, the process of strategy formulation, and organizational design to the allocation of marketing expenses. Of\ncourse, as a consultant, I had to account for the idiosyncrasies of a particular client. Still, I discovered that discussing \u201chow the best\nbusinesses do it\u201d was a great way to nudge a client toward a better solution.\n\nHere is a puzzle for you to chew on. I assume you will agree that all fund managers want to earn decent returns while beating\nthe market over the long run. Imagine a situation in which a multibillionaire investor shares his secret of getting rich with us\nevery year in a detailed letter. His best practice is widely known and available to everyone, and it hasn\u2019t changed for more than\nfifty years. We know his advice is invaluable because he continues to amass great wealth by following his teachings over almost six\ndecades. We also know that doing what he does is not difficult to understand or even implement, at least for the professionals. But\nmost choose to both laud him and ignore him.\n\nThat investor, of course, is Warren Buffett, and his simple advice to buy exceptional businesses at a sensible price and hold\nthem forever has made him one of the wealthiest people in the world. So then why does his advice fall on deaf ears? At first glance,\nthis seems somewhat bizarre. Investors seem to be voluntarily giving up the chance to get rich. But if you think about it for a mo-\nment, you will realize that Buffett\u2019s advice is hard to fathom for the same reason that Darwin\u2019s insight was not accepted for many\ndecades. We humans don\u2019t understand compounding. We say we do, but we don't.\n\nBuffett is the Darwin of investing\u2014he changed the field forever and for the better. But if eminent scientists in the late nine-\nteenth and early twentieth centuries could barely comprehend the power of cumulative growth, how can investors, who by and\nlarge are much more intellectually challenged, be expected to appreciate it? But the problem is worse than you think. Not only do\ninvestors blithely ignore Buffett, their behavior over the last fifty years indicates that they firmly believe the exact opposite! The\nholding period of stocks by mutual funds has fallen to less than a year from seven years in 1960.\n\nLet\u2019s return to Shelby Cullom Davis. Despite being radically different from Buffett in almost every way, how did he create his\n\nwealth? Just like Buffett, Davis held on to a select few quality businesses for decades.\n\f"}, "002075.png": {"text": "Unlike Buffett, who always wanted to be an investor, Davis became an investor through a series of fortunate events. When he\ngot married in January 1932, the Dow hit an all-time low of 41\u2014it had fallen 89 percent from its peak in 1929. His wife, Kathryn,\nprovided him his seed money for investing many years later; Davis was lucky that Kathryn\u2019s father, Joseph Wasserman, had kept\n\nhis money in government bonds and lost nothing in the Crash.\n\nAfter working as a reporter for CBS Radio, Davis earned his PhD along with Kathryn in political science at the University of\nGeneva (where Kathryn outscored him). In 1934, Davis was offered a job in Tokyo at the English-language newspaper, the Adver-\ntiser. Just as he and Kathryn were about to depart for Japan, an earthquake hit Tokyo, forcing them to cancel their trip. Also, the\nAdvertiser offer fell through. Davis was now desperate for a job, but he could not find any employment in journalism in the sicken-\n\ning state of the U.S. economy. Kathryn asked her brother, Bill, to employ Davis in his investment firm.\n\nDavis worked as a \u201cstatistician\u201d in Bill's firm and traveled around the country meeting companies that looked promising for\ninvestment. But Davis and Bill did not get along, and Davis left the job to start writing full time. He published a book called America\nFaces the Forties, which explored the causes of the Great Depression and how the 1940s might lead to recovery. It was reasonably\nwell received and caught the eye of Thomas E. Dewey, the governor of New York and Republican presidential hopeful (he lost to\n\nRoosevelt in 1944 and to Truman in 1948). In 1938, Dewey made Davis his speechwriter and economic adviser.\n\nAfter losing to Roosevelt in 1944, Dewey returned to his role as the governor of New York. He unknowingly put Davis on the\npath to fabulous riches by appointing him the deputy superintendent of the state\u2019s insurance department. Could there be a more\nboring-sounding job? But Davis took it seriously. He was an outspoken advocate of insurance companies diversifying from bonds\nto real estate, mortgages, and stocks. Contrary to popular opinion in those days, Davis considered bonds extremely risky. Neverthe-\nless, he was remarkably prescient. Bonds went into a thirty-five-year bear market from the mid-1940s; the government bond sold\n\nfor $101 in 1946 sold for just $17 in 1981.\n\nInvestors ignored insurance companies, usually quoted in the minor league of stock exchanges. Insurers were required to file\n\ntheir latest financials with the state agency, and Davis pored over these reports, becoming an expert at understanding their inner\n\f"}, "002076.png": {"text": "workings. He discovered that a typical insurer was selling for less than its \u201ctrue\u201d book value\u2014just the bonds and mortgages in an\ninsurer\u2019s portfolio could be worth far more than its market value. He realized that insurance customers paid money up front and\nthat insurers could deploy this \u201cfloat\u201d to buy bonds and mortgages. If customer claims weren't excessive, this hidden float could\nslowly and silently balloon over time. A patient investor could wait for this hidden asset to compound until the market, too, recog-\nnized it.\n\nDavis left his job in 1947, borrowed $50,000 from Kathryn, and started investing in well-run and dividend-paying insur-\nance companies selling for less than their book value. He also borrowed on the margin to fund some of his purchases. In a speech to.\nthe New York Insurance Brokers Association in 1952, Davis outlined his three criteria for selecting the stock of an insurer: (1) The\ninsurer had to be profitable, (2) its assets (bonds, mortgages, stocks) needed to be of the highest quality, and (3) its market price\nhad to be lower than its private market value. Davis was a value investor in high-quality insurers. And he held on to them.\n\nIn 1992, two years before his death, his top twelve holdings were worth $261 million\u2014about half his total portfolio. Except\nfor Fannie Mae, all were insurance companies. And he had bought each decades ago. His best investment, worth $72 million, was\nAIG, and his third-best, worth $27 million, was Berkshire Hathaway. Once he bought a great business, he never sold it.\n\nWhy should we reinvent the wheel when we have spectacular successes like Buffett and Davis to emulate? As I will discuss,\n\nDavis\u2019s success shows that we don\u2019t even have to be that good to succeed. Just patient. And so we are.\n\nReason 4: How Else Do I Pay for My Mistakes?\n\nShelby Davis bought about a hundred insurers that made up three-quarters of his portfolio, and about 1,500 companies globally\nmade up the rest. Most of these investments turned out to be duds! His other big mistake was to buy junk bonds worth about $23\n\nmillion\u2014almost all turned out to be actual junk.\n\f"}, "002077.png": {"text": "Davis made all his wealth by investing in a few high-quality insurers and then refusing to sell them. As a result, his hundreds\nof mistakes became irrelevant in the context of the exceptional long-term compounding of his winners.

Nevertheless, his portfolio proved once again that, over a lifetime of investing, a handful of high achievers\u2019 ideas could\nsupport a multitude of ne\u2019er-do-wells.\u201d\n\nIhave made many mistakes, and I know I will continue to do so. This is not humility but a cold hard fact. Waiting for a few\n\ngreat businesses to compound has paid for these mistakes. Let me share the actual numbers with you.\n\nOur first fund invested about INR 18 billion (about $400 million using the exchange rate prevalent at the time) in seventeen\nbusinesses from June 2007 to June 2011. In June 2022, given that enough time had passed, we could reliably assess the share price\nperformance of individual companies in this fund. We had only one capital loss in the portfolio, so that was a failure. Let me arbi-\ntrarily label any business (or rather, the market value of the business) earning an annualized rupee return of less than 10 percent\na \u201cfailure\u201d as well. Six of the seventeen businesses had earned an annualized rupee return of less than 10 percent by June 2022.\nThus, we had seven failures (one loss and six with an annualized return of less than 10 percent) out of seventeen businesses, or a\n\u201cfailure\u201d rate of 40 percent.\n\nBut the overall performance of this fund has been better than my wildest dreams. So how did we get here given the under-\n\nperformance of seven of our businesses? Because we did not sell our winners.\n\nLet me call these seven \u201cfailed\u201d businesses the \u201cSorry Seven.\u201d We invested INR 7.8 billion in the Sorry Seven. Let\u2019s see what\nhappens when we hold a good business for a long time. Take Supreme, India\u2019s leading plastic products company. We invested in\nSupreme in 2010, and by June 2022, we had owned it for almost twelve years. We invested INR 1 billion in Supreme, which was\nworth INR 13.9 billion in June 2022. The gain of INR 12.9 billion in Supreme is 1.7 times the total amount invested in the Sorry\nSeven (12.9 + 7.8 = 1.7).\n\f"}, "002078.png": {"text": "But it\u2019s much better than that.

Simply owning Page for fourteen years compensated for seven unsuccessful investments more\nthan five times over. If the upside of holding companies for long periods is so significant, why don\u2019t investors do it? One critical rea-\nson is an underappreciation of compounding, which makes fund managers value IRR more than the multiple, instead of the other\n\nway around.\n\nIn finance jargon, IRR is the internal rate of return, or the annualized rate of return. If a stock doubles in four years, its IRR is\n19 percent, and if it doubles in three, its IRR is 26 percent. For the same multiple, the shorter the period, the higher the IRR. Ignor-\ning the beauty of compounding, investors like to boast about the IRR of their investment while undervaluing the benefits of the\n\nmultiple.\n\f"}, "002079.png": {"text": "If we had been fans of IRR, we would have sold each of the Superb Six listed in table 10.4 a long time ago. The colossal down-\nside of doing this is evident from the example of Page. In December 2012, after four years of our owning Page, it had delivered 65\npercent IRR (!). For most investors, a holding period of four years seems long enough. It would not have been very intelligent to\nthink that we could earn 65 percent IRR incrementally over the next five to ten years. If we were IRR fans, we would have exited Page\nin December 2012, crowed about the astronomical return delivered over four years, and described the return in bold in our mar-\n\nketing materials (actually, we don\u2019t have any marketing materials, but that is beside the point).\n\nThe multiple on Page in December 2012 was 7.8x (compared to 82.2 in June 2022), so the gain on investment was \u201conly\u201d\nINR 3.4 billion. Remember that the cost of investment in the Sorry Seven of INR 7.8 billion does not change, regardless of the hold-\ning period of Page. Thus, if we had sold Page in December 2012, we would have recouped only 44 percent (3.4 + 7.8 = 44 percent)\nof our investment in the Sorry Seven. The remaining 56 percent burden would have had to be carried by the remaining businesses.\nHowever, since we have continued to hold Page, our gain has climbed to INR 40.8 billion, and the Sorry Seven have been paid for\n5.2 times over by the gain of this single holding (40.8 = 7.8 = 5.2).\n\nRemember the example of the rare mutant with color vision (just eight in one thousand) with only a 1 percent selective\nadvantage that overwhelmed the population in three thousand generations? Only a handful of compounders in a portfolio, grow-\ning a little more than the rest, achieve the same result given enough time.\n\nWe invest only in what we think are phenomenal businesses. But I also know that some may not perform and will need to be\n\npaid for. Hence, for investors like us, even thinking of selling our winners is worse than wrong. It\u2019s foolish.\n\nReason 5: The Only Way to Benefit from Compounding Is to Stay Invested\n\f"}, "002080.png": {"text": "If we are aggressive buyers during adverse stock price movements, logic dictates that we should be aggressive sellers when stock\nprices rise suddenly.

These nonactions during market euphoria have been as important as\u2014\nactually, more important than\u2014our acts of buying during market panics. As I wrote earlier, as of June 2022, out of our portfolio\nof twenty-four businesses (excluding the ones bought during the previous two years), we had multiplied our money by more than\nten times in INR in nine (of these, the largest multiple, 82, was for Page, and the smallest, 13x, was for Info Edge). In five of these\nnine, our holding period had been more than eleven years, and we had held the remaining ten-baggers for more than eight years.\n\nWhy do we not sell when stock prices rise dramatically?\n\nThe answer is shown in table 10.5.

The values are marginally different because table 10.4 accounts for\n\nredemptions in the fund (which force us to sell all stocks in proportion to their value). The difference, as you can see, is very small.\n\nLet me explain what you see in Havells. As of June 2022, we had held Havells for 8.5 years, or 2,724 days of trading (not\n\ncounting holidays). Our gain during this period was 1,270 percent. From table 10.5, the following facts stand out:\n\n+ 90 percent of the gain of 1,270 percent came in just thirty-five days. Those thirty-five days account for only 1.3 percent\nof the total number of trading days during which we held Havells. What if we had sold Havells during one (or more) of\nthose very few days? Those thirty-five days are distributed across all years. For example, the top three gains for the stock\ncame on September 20, 2019; January 21, 2021; and June 5, 2014. If, excited by the sudden price rise, we had sold our\nshares on June 5, 2014, we would have missed the significant jumps on September 20, 2019, and January 21, 2021. As\n\nyou can see, the numbers for Page are similar: 90 percent of the total gains came in just 2 percent of trading days.\n\f"}, "002082.png": {"text": "+ Havells stock gained 5 percent or more on just forty-four days, or 1.6 percent of the total number of trading days during\nour holding period. If we add up the gains from those days, they sum to 1,800 percent, or 142 percent of the total gains\nover 8.5 years. Thus, the forty-four days of stock price gains of 5 percent or more accounted for more than the total gain\nduring our entire holding period of almost nine years! The opportunity cost of not holding on to Havells shares during\nthose significant days would have been egregiously high. Check out the astronomical impact of 5-percent-plus days in\nPage\u2014they accounted for more than 300 percent of total gains! It would have been impossible for us to compound our\ncapital if we had not remained invested in Page.\n\n+ Last, please look at the data from the gloomy days (i.e., days when the stock price declined). I was pretty surprised to see\nthat the negative days account for almost half the total number of trading days across all three businesses. But, as you\n\ncan see, the negative days didn\u2019t matter because we held on to the companies throughout this period.\n\nDo you see where I am going with this analysis? If we had sold Havells or our other compounders on any day when their\nstock prices rose significantly, we would have been celebrated for raking in cash. Still, we would have repented at leisure as the\nstock prices continued to rise over the long run.\n\nBut how did I know that the Havells stock price would continue to rise? I didn\u2019t because I cannot predict stock prices. Ican\nmake two predictions, though. First, if we own a high-quality business, the share price will most probably (but not assuredly) react\npositively over the long run. Second, the share price will rarely make big moves, and if I am not invested in the stock on those partic-\nular days, I can bid farewell to substantial potential gains.\n\nIf we have done anything right, we have not done anything on days when selling seems to be the most logical thing to do.\n\nReason 6:1 Love Our Entrepreneurs\n\f"}, "002083.png": {"text": "I love our entrepreneurs. Behavioral economists have a quaint name for this disease: the endowment effect.

Unfortunately, we fulfill this requirement only for entry and some exits.\n\nBefore investing, we base our decision entirely on empirical evidence, as I have shown in chapters 1 through 7. But after we\nhave invested, and if a business continues to do well, I become emotionally attached to it. India is a tough place to do business (I\nam sure all countries are, but India is the only market I know), and almost every industry is fiercely competitive. In this cutthroat\nmarketplace, any entrepreneur who stays ahead of the competition by taking calculated risks while maintaining high profitability\nand a clean balance sheet is genuinely admirable.\n\nI know that new-age technology companies are in vogue, and everyone in the world seems to laud them while they blow\nother people\u2019s money by the millions or billions.

Ratnamani\u2019s clients are primarily refineries and petrochemical plants, both of which are cyclical in-\n\ndustries. Hence, Ratnamani\u2019s revenues and profits, too, are cyclical.\n\nWe first need to decide upon a time frame over which we will calculate the incremental return. It could be one year, three\nyears, or five years, or some other period. At the end of that time frame, we will need to forecast Ratnamani\u2019s profits and valuation\n\nmultiple (PE, EV/EBITDA, or some other metric).\n\nIf we want to calculate a three-year incremental return, we will need to forecast Ratnamani\u2019s revenues, expenses, and tax\nrates for the next three years. This is a nontrivial exercise for a cyclical business. First, a hapless analyst in the organization will\nneed to trash their weekends to collate the capital expenditure announcements of all the refineries and petrochemical plants that\ncould be Ratnamani\u2019s clients. Next, they will need to assume a particular market share for Ratnamani to forecast the company rev-\nenue. (\u201cHow?\u201d you ask? I have no idea\u2014ask the analyst.)

Buy a great business. Sit tight. Watch the moolah roll in.\n\nIt is, and it is not. Over my decades of investing, I have heard many objections from my fund manager friends and investors\nwho have refused to give us money because they were uncomfortable with our permanent owner approach. \u201cIt does not make\n\nsense\u201d is acommon refrain after I reveal that we plan to be permanent owners.\n\nLet me share with you some of these objections and my responses to them.\n\nObjection 1: Why Should I Hold On to 60 PE?\n\f"}, "002086.png": {"text": "We are price sensitive; we do not invest if the valuation is high. A logical question, then, is, Why aren\u2019t we sellers when the valua-\ntion is high?\n\nTake a concrete example of a business that went from a PE multiple of 15x to a PE multiple of 60x over five years of our\nholding period. Let\u2019s say that earnings doubled during those five years. We would be sitting on a multiple of eight times our initial\n\ninvestment: four times from multiple expansion and two times from earnings growth.\n\nMany investors would justify selling at this point with the following calculation. Let\u2019s say the business doubles its earnings\nover the next five years (the same as over the last five years). If the PE multiple stays the same, we will only double our money, and\nif it halves to 30 PE (which is possible because the long-term market PE is 19 to 20), we will not make any return for the next five\nyears. So shouldn't we be sellers?\n\nIt\u2019s a logical and fair question. It is so logical and fair that most fund managers will sell and exit at this point. We won't. The\n\nreasons are three-fold.\n\nFirst, I have found that great businesses usually surprise on the upside. What if the earnings triple or quadruple in the next\nfive years? Remember that we buy only phenomenal companies. They stand out because they are much better than the competi-\ntion and usually keep gaining market share and, more importantly, market power. We saw evidence of the increasing concentra-\n\ntion of leading businesses across most industries in the previous chapter.\n\nSecond, valuation multiples generally don\u2019t stay benign for great businesses. As I write this, Walmart, with a market value of\n$400 billion, has a PE of 33; L\u2019Or\u00e9al, with a market value of $260 billion, has a PE of 61! We are interested only in stellar businesses.\nTheir valuation multiples likely stay elevated over very long periods.\n\nThird, why should I limit my calculation to only the next five years? Let\u2019s say I am wrong on earnings growth and PE multiple\nover the next five years. Assume that the earnings stay flat and the valuation multiple halves. I will be sitting with a loss of 50 per-\n\ncent over five years. So what? What if the business continues to perform for a decade after five years? After five years, I will fail to\n\f"}, "002087.png": {"text": "capture the value from years five to fifteen by selling at a high multiple. Let me share a theoretical case and a real case to make my\npoint.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the example from the beginning of this section. I buy shares of Company A for $1 in the year 2000 for a PE\nmultiple of 15. In 2005, the earnings have doubled, and the PE multiple has expanded to 60. The share price is now $8. IfI sell, I\n\nwill make eight times my money at an annualized return of 52 percent. Very nice, right? But I choose to hold.\n\nIn the next five years, the earnings stay flat, and the valuation halves to 30 PE. The stock price is $4 in 2010. So I have lost\nhalf the capital relative to 2005. I look like a fool. But wait.\n\nIf the business does well, and if the earnings quadruple over the next ten years, from 2010 to 2020 (this is an annualized\ngrowth of 15 percent, not an aggressive assumption for a great business), and if the multiple increases by 50 percent to 45 PE,\nthe stock price would be $24 in 2020. It thus has an annualized return of 17 percent over twenty years. I have made twenty-four\ntimes my money in twenty years, which, for me, is a much better outcome than eight times my money in five years. Why? Because\nI would have made mistakes in between, and as I discussed earlier in this chapter, someone needs to compensate for it. As Shelby\nDavis has shown us, not all the businesses in our portfolio need to work from year five to year fifteen; a handful will be more than\n\nsufficient.\n\nNow let me share an actual example from our portfolio. We bought Ratnamani for INR 128 per share from late 2010 to early\n2011. The price did not move for the next three years, and in January 2014, the stock price was INR 135. We stayed calm and con-\ntinued to hold our shares because the company was doing fine. However, in January 2015, the share price jumped to INR 700, a\n\nfive-fold increase in just one year. The earnings had expanded suddenly, and so had the valuation multiple.\n\nShould we have sold? We didn\u2019t. Why? Because the business continued to be stellar. The price stayed around the same level of\nabout INR 700 for the next two years until January 2017 before slowly moving upward. In January 2021, the price was INR 1,600.\nIf we had sold our shares for INR 700 per share in 2015, we would have missed the run-up to INR 1,600 over the next six years.\n\nMore importantly, what matters to us is our buy price of INR 128, and, relative to this price, INR 1,600 for a ten-year hold does not\n\f"}, "002088.png": {"text": "seem bad at all (an annualized return of 29 percent).

Shree is the best cement business in\nIndia and is probably one of the best in the world.

I assumed that we would \u201cplay\u201d the commodity cycle by buying when the sentiment was weak and selling\nwhen the mood turned positive. I knew we could not time the cycle perfectly, but I thought we could do reasonably well. I sold\nShree for about INR 3,800 per share in October 2012 because I thought our \u201cincremental\u201d return over the long run would be un-\nderwhelming. Instead, we made about 2.2 times our money in less than a year. We returned the proceeds of $80 million to our in-\n\nvestors and felt proud to have trounced the market.\n\nIt was the stupidest decision I have ever made. The cost to the fund?

She has faced multiple ice ages,\nthousands of environmental catastrophes, an unending stream of macro- and microscopic predators, and the arrival of the most\n\ndestructive beings in the history of the planet: Home sapiens.\n\f"}, "002096.png": {"text": "The most consequential decision in the life of honeybees is the choice of their home. I call it a \u201cdecision\u201d because that is what\nit is: It seems to follow a process, it can take many hours or even days, and every honeybee in the colony appears to have a say. Un-\n\nlike eating, mating, or fighting, choosing a home appears to be a deliberate and \u201cthoughtful\u201d process for honeybees. Let me explain.\n\nHoneybees are highly social and live in colonies of thousands in very close proximity. A beehive typically has a single queen\nfed and protected by worker bees, all of whom happen to be sterile females. A single colony typically splits into a few colonies\n(called swarms) at the end of winter. Each of these swarms needs to find a new home to construct beeswax combs, raise worker\n\nbees, and build a store of honey for the following winter.\n\nHence, as the bees create a new swarm, their most important task is finding a suitable nesting location for their hive. Their\nhome needs to have a cavity volume to accommodate enough honey to last the entire winter. In addition, the entrance needs to be\nhigh enough above the ground to prevent land-based predators from targeting the bees. The entrance should also be small to en-\n\nsure secrecy and warmth so that the bees\u2019 home can be protected from the elements, such as extreme winds.\nSo, how do honeybees select their home? By dancing.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have decided to study how honeybees choose their nesting site. Here is what you will observe. When the bees\nfrom the mother colony split into a swarm, a few dozen scouts fly away in different directions to inspect nesting sites within a five-\nkilometer radius. When a scout encounters an attractive site, she returns to the swarm and performs a waggle dance to commu-\nnicate the site\u2019s distance, direction, and quality to her sisters. (The males are lazy bums and don\u2019t do any work; their only job is to\nimpregnate the queen.) The duration of the dance is proportional to the distance to the new site, the angle at which the bee wag-\ngles represents the angle of the outward run relative to the sun, and the vigorousness of the waggle (the number of dance circuits)\ndenotes the quality of the new site.\n\nSince the scouts have flown over a large area, they advertise many widely separated locations to their hive mates. The hon-\neybees in the swarm follow the lead of various scouts to check out the widely dispersed sites and return to the swarm to perform\n\ntheir waggle dance.\n\f"}, "002097.png": {"text": "Thus, initially, the scouts advertise several possible nesting sites, seemingly trying to recruit their hive mates to each of the\nchosen sites in what appears to be a quite chaotic scene. However, after a few hours or days, all of the bees begin to dance in favor of\njust one location. Once a consensus has been established, the swarm flies to the chosen location. But, of course, the bees don\u2019t have\na leader. (The queen bee is just a reproduction machine and is entirely dependent on the worker bees for her food and welfare.) So\nyou will (rightly) conclude that the choice of nesting site is accomplished through a democratic process in which all the honeybees\nhave participated.\n\nOnce you have observed this phenomenon, here are some of the questions you will probably ask: How does this democratic\nprocess of building almost 100 percent consensus work? How does dancing lead to consensus over time? Do the bees reach the\n\n\u201cright\u201d decision? Is this decision-making a simple or complex process? Let\u2019s proceed step by step.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, honeybees need to select a high-quality dwelling place to ensure their survival. But what is not\napparent is that if they are given a choice of multiple high-quality sites, they will almost always choose the best possible site. \u201cGood\nenough\u201d is not acceptable to these discerning bees. When scientists artificially create a number of good nesting sites within the\nflying range of honeybees, they find that the bees almost always converge on the best possible site. Even more surprisingly, the\nbees seldom find the best nesting site first. But over time, even if the bees discover the best site much later than other slightly infe-\nrior sites, consensus is ultimately built around the best site.\n\nResearchers have conclusively proven that honeybees have an absolute standard for assessing the quality of a nesting site.\nThe vigorousness of their waggle dance, translated into the number of dance circuits, indicates the quality of a particular site. A\nhoneybee takes between fifteen minutes and an hour to evaluate a potential site. She inspects the cavity\u2019s outside and spends a lot\nof time inside walking around and taking short flights. If the bee finds the nesting site desirable on first inspection, she returns\nto the swarm and advertises the site with a waggle dance. If another bee follows her to this site, she will perform almost the same\nwaggle dance (in terms of duration and intensity) when she returns to the swarm. Honeybees have a universal standard for assess-\n\ning nest quality.\n\f"}, "002098.png": {"text": "All honeybees have a congruent interest while choosing a nesting site. Their consensus is built over time so that eventually,\n\nall bees support just one site, and this almost always happens to be the best possible site. But how?\n\nInitially, scientists hypothesized that a honeybee scout compares her old nesting site with a new site (to which other\ndancing scouts recruited her). If she finds that the new site is of higher quality, she ceases support for the old site and dances more\nvigorously to demonstrate support for the new site. Thus, more dance circuits implies that the new site is better than the last one.\nThis process builds consensus over time since the bees keep comparing the various nest sites, and the best site wins in the end.\nThis hypothesis made perfect sense. But it has turned out to be wrong. Most honeybees visit just one nesting site, and very few\n\nvisit two or more.\n\nSo what's going on? Painstaking work by Thomas Seeley and others revealed the mystery behind the consensus-building\nprocess.\u2018 It has just two elements. First, as we already know, the bees dance more circuits for a better-quality site. Second, the bees\n\nin the swarm attach themselves randomly to a dancing honeybee to explore a new site.\n\nBut how do these two simple actions lead to a consensus of nearly 100 percent over the best possible site? First, let\u2019s look at a\n\nsimplified version of what happens in the wild.\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are three scouts to begin with, and they evaluate three possible new nesting sites\u2014A, B, and C\u2014of varying\nquality. Let\u2019s assume site A is the best and site C is the worst. After assessing site A, the first scout returns to the swarm and per-\nforms twenty dance circuits. The second scout evaluates site B and performs ten dance circuits. Finally, the third scout performs\n\nonly five dance circuits after evaluating site C.\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are one hundred bees in the swarm waiting for their scout sisters to return. Remember that they will at-\ntach themselves randomly to any bee dancing and will then go and explore the site that this bee is excited about. Since the first bee\ncontributes to 57 percent of the dance circuits (20 + 35), fifty-seven of the one hundred bees in the swarm will attach themselves\nto the first bee. By the same logic, twenty-nine bees will end up assessing site B, and only fourteen will assess site C. What happens\n\nwhen these one hundred bees return to the swarm?\n\f"}, "002099.png": {"text": "57 honeybees from site A perform 20 dances each = 1,140 dance circuits\n29 honeybees from site B perform 10 dances each = 290 dance circuits\n\n14 honeybees from site C perform 5 dances each = 70 dance circuits\n\nThus, site A now contributes 76 percent (1,140 = 1,500) of the total number of dance circuits performed by the bees com-\npared to 57 percent in the first round. In the next round, the bees attach themselves randomly to any of their dancing sisters. And\nso, 76 percent of the waiting bees will go and explore site A.\n\nIf this process keeps going, you can see that the support for the best site, A, will keep increasing exponentially\u2014in the third\nround, following the same logic, support for site A will increase to 88 percent\u2014until almost all the bees are supporting only site A.\n\nAre you as gobsmacked as I was when I first read about this process? Do you see what has happened here? The honeybees\nhave an extraordinarily complex and challenging decision to make. Yet, they make it through a very straightforward process:\n\nDance harder for a better site, and attach yourself randomly to a dancing sister. That\u2019s it.\n\nWe Follow a Simple and Repeatable Process Like the Honeybees\n\nThe investment community ties itself up in knots over finding the \u201cbest\u201d investments. I have seen extraordinarily complex algo-\nrithms and multigigabyte spreadsheets to assess the value and quality of a business. On the other hand, we are interested only in\n\nexecuting a sound investment process.\n\nOur algorithm, while nowhere near as elegant as the honeybees\u2019, has only three steps:\n\n1. Eliminate significant risks.\n\f"}, "002100.png": {"text": "2. Invest only in stellar businesses at a fair price.\n\n3. Own them forever.\n\nThe honeybee algorithm does not lead to 100 percent success, and it need not. Some swarms are unable to find a suitable\ndwelling location and perish. But so what? It is a statistically robust process in which, on average, the simple nest-seeking model\nworks beautifully. And the reason it is robust is that in addition to the algorithm being sound, it is repeatable. Deviations from this\nsimple model are neither required nor allowed. A honeybee colony sticks to its nest-seeking process season after season, year after\nyear, millennium after millennium.\n\nThe failure of most investors does not lie in pursuing a wrong model but in failing to repeatedly pursue a good model.

This is because most investments are bad. Now, let\u2019s say we encounter a bad investment. If we mistakenly\nassume that this investment is good, we would have rejected the null hypothesis that the investment is bad. Thus, in this\ncase, rejecting the null hypothesis would mean that we would make a bad investment. We would have lost money. Now,\nlet\u2019s look at a good investment. In this case, a type Il error occurs when we accept a null hypothesis that is false. Here, the\nnull hypothesis is false because the investment is good.

Shackelford-Weekes (Cham, Denmark: Springer, 2018), https://\ndoi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-16999-6_2100-1. On carotenoids, see Searcy and Nowicki, The Evolution of Animal Commu-\nnication, chapter 3. While the handicap principle seems to provide a logical explanation for assessing the reliability of\nsignals, scientists have proposed other mechanisms, too; see Searcy and Nowicki, The Evolution of Animal Communication,\nchapter 6: \u201cIn summary, the reliability of some classes of signals seem best explained by the handicap principle, in the\nsense of signal costs that act differentially on different categories of signallers.\u201d Note the qualifier \u201csome classes of sig-\nnals.\u201d The authors describe the following four alternatives to the handicap principle: (1) Signals can be honest without the\nsignaler incurring a cost if the receiver and the sender have the same interest; for example, alarm signals given by birds\nwhen they see a predator. (2) When the benefit to the signaler (as opposed to the cost) varies with the attribute of the sig-\nnal, honest signals may arise; for example, when offspring solicit their parents for food. (3) The \u201cconstraints hypothesis\u201d\nstates that a signal can be honest when bodily or other constraints force the signal to be reliable; for example, carotenoid\n\npigmentation in red-shouldered widowbirds (see chapter 4). (4) The theory of \u201cindividually directed skepticism\u201d states\n\f"}, "002131.png": {"text": "that receivers remember the honesty or dishonesty of signals emitted from a certain signaler in the past and adjust their\nresponse to the signaler accordingly.
