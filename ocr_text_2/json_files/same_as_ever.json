I was on the Squaw Valley Ski Team, and it was the center of my life for a decade.\n\nOur ski team consisted of a dozen racers. By the early 2000s we were teenagers, and most of us had spent the majority of our\nlives together. We skied six days a week, ten months a year, traveling the globe to wherever we could find snow.\n\nI wasn\u2019t close to most of them\u2014we spent too much time together and fought like cats. But four of us had become inseparable\nfriends. This is the story of two of those friends\u2014Brendan Allan and Bryan Richmond.\n\nOn February 15, 2001, our team had just returned from a race in Colorado. Our flight home was delayed because Lake Tahoe had\nbeen hit with a blizzard extreme even by its own standards.\n\nYou can\u2019t ski race when there\u2019s a blanket of new snow\u2014racing requires hard-packed ice. So training was canceled, and Brendan,\nBryan, and I prepared for a week of what we called free skiing: unstructured goofing off, skiing around, and having a good time.\n\nEarlier that month Tahoe received several feet of light, fluffy snow that comes from bitter-cold air. The storm that hit in mid-\nFebruary was different. It was warm\u2014barely at the freezing point\u2014and powerful, leaving three feet of heavy, wet snow.\n\nWe didn\u2019t think about it at the time, but the combination of heavy snow on top of fluffy snow creates textbook avalanche condi-\ntions. A light base of snow with a heavy layer on top is incredibly fragile and prone to sliding.\n\nSki resorts are pretty good at protecting customers from avalanches by closing off the most dangerous slopes and using explo-\n\nsives to intentionally set off avalanches late at night, before customers arrive in the morning.\n\f"}, "002265.png": {"text": "But if you're skiing out of bounds\u2014ducking under the po norcross ropes to ski the forbidden, untouched terrain\u2014that system\nwon't help you.\n\nOn the morning of February 21, 2001, Brendan, Bryan, and I met in the Squaw Valley Ski Team locker room, like we had hun-\ndreds of times before. Bryan\u2019s last words when he left his house that morning were, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom, I won't ski out of bounds.\u201d\n\nBut as soon as we clicked into our skis, that\u2019s what we did.\n\nThe backside of Squaw Valley (now called Palisades Tahoe), behind the KT-22 chairlift, is a stretch of mountain about a mile long\nthat separates Squaw from Alpine Meadows ski resort.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing skiing\u2014steep and wide-open, with rolling terrain.\n\nBefore February 21 I had skied it maybe a dozen times.

It spits\nyou out on a backcountry road, from where we would hitchhike back to our locker room.\n\nBrendan, Bryan, and I decided to ski it that morning.\n\nWithin seconds of ducking under the out-of-bounds ropes, I remember getting caught in an avalanche.\n\nIhad never experienced one before, but it was unforgettable. I didn\u2019t hear or see the slide. I just suddenly realized my skis\nweren\u2019t on the ground anymore\u2014I was literally floating in a cloud of snow. You have no control in these situations, because rather\nthan you pushing the snow to gain traction with your skis, the snow is pushing you.

It became a staging\narea for the search.\n\nI laid back down on the bench and finally fell asleep.\n\nA few minutes later I awoke to the sound of a scream, yelling, and commotion.\n\nI knew what had happened.

And the oil industry knows two\nspeeds: boom and bust. So they\u2019ll probably pump too much. Then prices fall, all while people own more efficient vehicles. Then\nmaybe the suburbs become more popular\u2014and people end up driving even more than before.\n\nSo who knows.\n\nEvery event creates its own offspring, which impact the world in their own special ways.

The\ngoal was to test NASA\u2019s new space suit.\n\nThe flight was a success. The suit worked beautifully.\n\nAs Prather descended back to earth, he opened the faceplate on his helmet when he was low enough to breathe on his own, os-\ntensibly to catch some fresh air.\n\nHe landed in the ocean as planned, where a helicopter was to pull him to safety. But there was a small mishap: While connecting\nhimself to the helicopter\u2019s rescue line, Prather slipped, falling into the ocean.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t have been that big a deal, and no one in the rescue helicopter panicked. The space suit should have been water-\ntight and buoyant.\n\nBut since Prather had opened his faceplate, he was now exposed to the elements. Water rushed into his suit. Prather drowned.\n\nThink of how much planning goes into launching someone into space. So much expertise, so many contingencies. So many\nwhat-ifs and what-thens. Every detail is contemplated by thousands of experts. NASA is probably the most planning-centric or-\nganization that has ever existed; you don\u2019t go to the moon by crossing your fingers and hoping for the best. Every conceivable risk\nhas a plan A, plan B, plan C.\n\nBut even then\u2014despite so much planning\u2014a tiny thing no one had considered invites catastrophe.\n\nAs financial advisor Carl Richards says, \u201cRisk is what\u2019s left over after you think you've thought of everything.\u201d\n\f"}, "002275.png": {"text": "That\u2019s the real definition of risk\u2014what\u2019s left over after you've prepared for the risks you can imagine.\n\nRisk is what you don\u2019t see.\n\nLook at the big news stories that move the needle\u2014COVID-19, 9/11, Pearl Harbor, the Great Depression.

We'd\nnever get anywhere if everyone viewed the world as a clean set of rational rules to follow.\n\nThe next is accepting that what\u2019s rational to one person can be crazy to another. Everything would compute if everyone had the\nsame time horizon, goals, ambitions, and risk tolerances. But they don\u2019t. Panic-selling stocks after they\u2019ve declined 5 percent is a\nterrible idea if you're a long-term investor, and a career imperative if you're a professional trader. There is no world in which every\nbusiness or investing decision you see other people make will align with your own hopes and dreams of how things should be.\n\nThird is understanding the power of incentives. A financial bubble might seem irrational, but the people who work in industries\nthat are in bubbles\u2014mortgage brokers in 2004 or stockbrokers in 1999\u2014make so much money from them that there\u2019s a powerful\nincentive to keep the music playing. They delude not only their customers but themselves.\n\nLast is the power of stories over statistics. \u201cHousing prices in relation to median incomes are now above their historic average\nand typically mean revert\u201d is a statistic. \u201cJim just made $500,000 flipping homes and can now retire early and his wife thinks he\u2019s\namazing\u201d is a story. And it\u2019s way more persuasive in the moment.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to compute, but it\u2019s how the world works.\n\nIn the next chapter, we'll look at life\u2019s guaranteed ability to swing from one absurdity to the next.\n\f"}, "002329.png": {"text": "Calm Plants the Seeds of Crazy\n\nCrazy doesn\u2019t mean broken.

He was enormous, the largest human ever known.\n\nA pituitary gland abnormality bombarded Wadlow\u2019s body with growth hormone, leading to staggering size.

Had Wadlow lived longer and kept growing, casual walking would have caused his leg bones to break.

It was the last link that made the century-old railroad network truly efficient, creating last-mile service that connected the\nworld.\n\nElectrification also surged in the 1930s, particularly to rural Americans left out of the urban electrification of the 1920s.\n\nThe New Deal's Rural Electrification Administration (REA) brought power to farms in what may have been the decade's only\npositive development in regions that were economically devastated.

They lowered the bar of\njustified use.\n\nIt changed the game, all for the worse.\n\nThe risk was that a country would \u201cresponsibly\u201d use a tiny nuclear weapon in battle, starting a retaliatory escalation that\nopened the door to launching one of the big bombs.\n\nNeither country would start a war with a big bomb. But would they launch a small one? Probably. And would a small bomb jus-\ntify retaliating with a big one? Yes.\n\nSo the small bombs increased the odds of the big bombs being used.\n\nSmall risks weren\u2019t the alternative to big risks; they were the trigger.\n\nSoviet missiles in Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis were four thousand times less powerful than Tsar Bomba. But if the\nSoviets had launched even one of them, according to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, there would have been a \u201c99 percent\nprobability\u201d that America would have retaliated with its full nuclear force.\n\nRobert Oppenheimer, the physicist who helped create the atomic bomb, was guilt-stricken about its destructiveness and pushed\nfor smaller nukes to reduce the risk. He later admitted that was a mistake, because it increased the odds of a large nuclear attack.\n\nBig risks are easy to overlook because they\u2019re just a chain reaction of small events, each of which is easy to shrug off. So people\nalways underestimate the odds of big risks.\n\n\u2018We've seen it happen time after time.\n\nNo one in 1929 thought there would be a Great Depression.

But combined they turned into a disaster.\n\nThe Tenerife airport disaster in 1977 is the deadliest aircraft accident in history. The error was stunning. One plane took off\nwhile another was still on the runway, and the two Boeing 747s collided, killing 583 people on a runway on the Spanish island.\n\nIn the aftermath authorities wondered how such an egregious catastrophe could occur. One postmortem study explained\nexactly how: \u201cEleven separate coincidences and mistakes, most of them minor... had to fall precisely into place\u201d for the crash to\noccur. Lots of tiny mistakes added up to a huge one.\n\nIt\u2019s good to always assume the world will break about once per decade, because historically it has. The breakages feel like low-\nprobability events, so it\u2019s common to think they won't keep happening.

The best any species can do is to be good at some things until\nthe things it\u2019s not good at suddenly matter more. And then it dies.\n\nAcentury ago a Russian biologist named Ivan Schmalhausen described how this works. A species that evolves to become very\ngood at one thing tends to become vulnerable at another. A bigger lion can kill more prey, but it\u2019s also a larger target for hunters to\nshoot at. A taller tree captures more sunlight, but becomes vulnerable to wind damage. There is always some inefficiency.\n\nSo species rarely evolve to become perfect at anything, because perfecting one skill comes at the expense of another skill that\nwill eventually be critical to survival.

But\nthey\u2019re not, because it would backfire.\n\nSo they\u2019re all a little imperfect.\n\nNature's answer is a lot of good enough, below-potential traits across all species. Biologist Anthony Bradshaw says that evolu-\ntion\u2019s successes get all the attention, but its failures are equally important. And that\u2019s how it should be: Not maximizing your po-\ntential is actually the sweet spot in a world where perfecting one skill compromises another.\n\nEvolution has spent 3.8 billion years testing and proving the idea that some inefficiency is good.\n\nWe know it\u2019s right.\n\nSo maybe we should pay more attention to it.\n\f"}, "002379.png": {"text": "Many people strive for efficient lives, where no hour is wasted.

It\u2019s the opposite: A lot of thought jobs basically never stop, and without structuring time to think\nand be curious, you wind up less efficient during the hours that are devoted to sitting at your desk cranking out work.

The most efficient calendar in the world\u2014one where every minute is packed with productivity\u2014comes at the ex-\npense of curious wandering and uninterrupted thinking, which eventually become the biggest contributors to success.\n\nAnother form of helpful inefficiency is a business whose operations have some slack built in.\n\nJust-in-time manufacturing\u2014where companies don\u2019t stock the parts they need to build products, relying instead on last-\nminute shipments of components\u2014was the epitome of efficient operations over the last twenty years.

Bigger species are better at capturing prey, can travel longer distances, and can support bigger brains.\n\nThe obvious question is: Why hasn\u2019t evolution made every species enormous?\n\nTwo scientists, Aaron Clauset of the Santa Fe Institute and Douglas Erwin of the Museum of Natural History, explained why in\na paper that summed it up in a wonderful sentence: \u201cThe tendency for evolution to create larger species is counterbalanced by the\ntendency of extinction to kill off larger species.\u201d\n\nBody size in biology is like leverage in investing: It accentuates the gains but amplifies the losses.

A human will die from a fall at ten times its height.\nAn elephant falling from twice its height splashes like a water balloon.\n\nBig animals also require lots of land per capita, which is brutal when land becomes scarce. They need more food per unit of body\nmass than small animals, which is the end game in a famine. They can\u2019t hide easily. They move slow. They reproduce slowly.

The Times wrote in 1974:\n\nDonald T.

But it is not unique. It is in many ways the default outcome\nof once-dominant companies.\n\nGoing public is a sign that a company has found enough competitive advantage to scale into a large corporation. But almost 40\npercent of all public companies lost all their value from 1980 to 2014.

Success has its\nown gravity. \u201cThe higher the monkey climbs a tree, the more you can see his ass,\u201d oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens used to say.\n\nFive big things tend to eat away at competitive advantages.\n\nOne is that being right instills confidence that you can\u2019t be wrong, which is a devastating characteristic in a world where outlier\nsuccess has a target on its back, with competitors in tow. Size is associated with success, success is associated with hubris, and\nhubris is the beginning of the end of success.\n\nAnother is that success tends to lead to growth, usually by design, but a big organization is a different animal than a small one,\nand strategies that lead to success at one size can be impossible at another.

Hard work is in pursuit of a goal, and once that goal is met the relaxation that feels so justified\nremoves paranoia. This allows competitors and a changing world to creep in unnoticed.\n\nA fourth is that a skill that\u2019s valuable in one era may not extend to the next. You can work as hard and be as paranoid as you've\n\nalways been, but if the world no longer values your skill, it\u2019s a loss. Being a one-trick pony is common, because people and compa-\n\n \n\nnies that are very good at one specific thing tend to be the highest paid during the boom.\n\nThe last is that some success is owed to being in the right place at the right time. The reversion to reality that unmasks good luck\nis often only obvious with hindsight, and is both humbling and tempting not to believe.\n\nThe idea that advantage has a shelf life is a fundamental part of growth. It doesn\u2019t have to be a tragedy\u2014not all competitive\nadvantages end like Sears.

Longevity was seen as both a trophy and a forecast.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Van Valen set out to prove that the conventional wisdom was right. But he couldn't.

But among groups of species, the probability of extinction was roughly the same whether it\nwas 10,000 years old or 10 million years old.\n\nIna 1973 paper titled \u201cA New Evolutionary Law,\u201d Van Valen wrote that \u201cthe probability of extinction of a taxon is effectively\nindependent of its age.\u201d\n\nIf you take a thousand marbles and remove 2 percent of them each year, some marbles will remain in the jar after twenty years.\nBut the odds of being picked out are the same every year (2 percent).

Some happen to live a long time, but the odds of surviving don\u2019t improve over time.\n\nVan Valen argued that\u2019s the case mainly because competition isn\u2019t like a football game that ends with a winner who can then\ntake a break. Competition never stops. A species that gains an advantage over a competitor instantly incentivizes the competitor to\nimprove. It\u2019s an arms race.\n\nEvolution is the study of advantages. Van Valen\u2019s idea is simply that there are no permanent advantages. Everyone is madly\nscrambling all the time, but no one gets so far ahead that they become extinction-proof.\n\nSome things evolve but never actually become better adapted, because threats are always changing.

In 1802\n\u2014three quarters of a century before Edison\u2019s lightbulb\u2014a British inventor named Humphry Davy created an electric light called\nan arc lamp, using charcoal rods as a filament.

The path from A to Z can be so complex and end up\nat such a strange point that it\u2019s nearly impossible to look at today\u2019s tools and extrapolate what they might become. Someone some-\nwhere right now is inventing or discovering something that will utterly change the future. But you're probably not going to know\nabout it for years.

It\u2019s the idea that variance\nequals strength, because the more diverse a population is, the more chances it has to come up with new traits that can be selected\nfor. No one can know what traits will be useful; that\u2019s not how evolution works. But if you create a lot of traits, the useful one\u2014\nwhatever it is\u2014will be in there somewhere.\n\nIt\u2019s the same thing with innovation. At any given moment it\u2019s easy to look around at what start-ups are building or what\nscientists are discovering and think that what we're working on is maybe neat\u2014at best\u2014but pales in comparison to what we did\nyesterday. Since we never know how multiple innovations will collide, the path of least resistance is to conclude that our best days\nare behind us while ignoring the potential of what we\u2019re working on.\n\nOne takeaway here is that it\u2019s easy to always feel like we're falling behind. In most eras it can feel like we haven't invented any-\nthing useful for ten or twenty years. But that\u2019s merely because it can take ten or twenty years for an innovation to become useful.\nWhen you realize that progress is made step-by-step, slowly over time, you realize that tiny little innovations that no one thinks\nmuch of are the seeds for what has the potential to compound into something great.\n\nDee Hock says, \u201cA book is far more than what the author wrote; it is everything you can imagine and read into it as well.\u201d It\u2019s\nsimilar with new technology.

In 1947\n\nHamilton Fish Armstrong reported in Foreign Affairs magazine about life in Europe:\n\nEvery minute is dedicated to scrounging enough food, clothing and fuel to carry through the next 24 hours.\nThere is too little of everything . . . too few houses to live in and not enough glass to supply them with window panes;\ntoo little leather for shoes, wool for sweaters, gas for cooking, cotton for diapers, sugar for jam, fats for frying, milk for\n\nbabies, soap for washing.\n\f"}, "002440.png": {"text": "After the war, John Maynard Keynes predicted countries wrecked by war would go on to have a \u201ccraving for social and personal\nsecurity.\u201d\n\nWhich is what happened.\n\nHistorian Tony Judt notes that the state of affairs was so bad in postwar Europe that only the state could offer hope of salvation\nto the masses of displaced people. So it did. Everything from generous unemployment insurance to universal health care became\ncommon after the war in ways that never caught on in America.\n\nHistorian Michael Howard has said that war and welfare go hand in hand. Perhaps that\u2019s because even the most financially pre-\npared, the most risk averse, and those with the most foresight can be completely crushed by war. Europeans did not get to choose\nwhether they wanted to be caught up in World War II\u2014it became the most pressing issue of their lives whether they supported it\nor not, and it crushed their sense of control whether they prepared for it or not.\n\nIt\u2019s why baby boomers who lived through the 1970s and \u201980s think about inflation in ways their children couldn\u2019t fathom as\nyoung adults.\n\nAnd it\u2019s why you can separate today\u2019s tech entrepreneurs into two clearly different buckets\u2014those who experienced the dot-\ncom crash in the late 1990s, and those who didn\u2019t because they were too young.\n\nTwo things tend to happen after you get hit with something big and unexpected:\n\n+ You assume what just happened will keep happening, but with greater force and consequence.\n\n- You forecast with great conviction, despite the original event being improbable and something few, if anyone,\n\npredicted.\n\nThe more impactful the surprise, the more this is true.\n\f"}, "002441.png": {"text": "And, importantly, the more those who didn\u2019t experience that big event will struggle to understand your point of view.\n\nThe oldest story is that of two sides who don\u2019t agree with each other.\n\nThe question \u201cWhy don\u2019t you agree with me?\u201d can have infinite answers.

It\u2019s much easier to assume that those who disagree with you aren\u2019t thinking as hard as you are.\n\nSo people will disagree, even as access to information explodes. They may disagree more than ever because, as Benedict Evans\nsays, \u201cThe more the Internet exposes people to new points of view, the angrier people get that different views exist.\u201d\n\nDisagreement has less to do with what people know and more to do with what they\u2019ve experienced.\n\nAnd since experiences will always be different, disagreement will be constant.\n\nSame as it\u2019s ever been.\n\nSame as it will always be.\n\nSame as it ever was.\n\f"}, "002442.png": {"text": "Questions\n\nhe night before the D-Day invasion, Franklin Roosevelt asked his wife, Eleanor, how she felt about not knowing what\nwould happen next.\n\u201cTo be nearly sixty and still rebel at uncertainty is ridiculous isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said.\n\nIt is.
