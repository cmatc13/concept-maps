Munger\n\nBY MICHAEL BROGGIE\n\nBehind the extraordinary story of Berkshire Hathaway are two financial geniuses: the widely acclaimed Warren Buffett and his\n\u201csilent partner,\u201d Charlie Munger, who relishes his obscurity.\n\nCharlie is Warren\u2019s friend, lawyer, adviser, devil\u2019s advocate (Warren once called him the \u201cabominable no-man\u201d), and one of the\nlargest stockholders in one of the most successful publicly traded companies in American business history. Since 1964, when War-\nren\u2014and, some years later, Charlie\u2014assumed management of Berkshire, its market value has increased an astonishing 13,500\ntimes, from $10 million to roughly $135 billion, without much of an increase in outstanding shares. Such phenomenal growth is\nthe singular achievement of these two unassuming Midwesterners, who combine their synergistic abilities to recognize and seize\nopportunities other businessmen consistently overlook.\n\nWhile Warren is one of the most admired and publicized business leaders in the country, Charlie has purposefully sidestepped\nthe limelight, choosing relative anonymity instead. To better understand this complex and highly private businessman, we must\n\nstart at the beginning. Charles Thomas Munger was born on January 1, 1924, in America\u2019s heartland, Omaha, Nebraska. Many no-\n\f"}, "003802.png": {"text": "tables share his Midwestern roots: Will Rogers, Henry Fonda, John Pershing, Harry Truman, Walt Disney, Ann Landers, Gerald Ford\n\u2014and, of course, Warren Buffett.\n\nCharlie initially crossed paths with the Buffett family during the formative years of his life when he worked at Buffett & Son, an\nupscale grocery store in Omaha, about six blocks from the Munger household. The boss and part owner was Warren\u2019s grandfather,\nErnest. A strict disciplinarian, he scheduled his young workers for 12-hour shifts with no meals or breaks. According to Charlie,\nhis boss\u2019s staunch anti-socialist attitude was manifested in his rule requiring the boys to present two pennies at the end of their\nshifts to cover their share of the cost of the new Social Security Act. In return, they received a $2 daily wage\u2014along with a consid-\nfable lecture about the evils of socialism.\n\nThe arduous working conditions in the Buffett grocery store had a lasting influence on both Charlie and Warren. Warren, six\nyears younger, served his hard times under Grandpa Ernest several years after his future business partner had moved on.\n\nCharlie\u2019s formal education began at Dundee Elementary School, where he and his younger sisters, Mary and Carol, were indoc-\ntrinated with ethical homilies. Charlie\u2019s teachers remember a smart kid who was also inclined to be a bit of a wiseacre. He enjoyed\nchallenging the conventional wisdom of teachers and fellow students with his ever-increasing knowledge gained through vora-\ncious reading, particularly biographies. Today, he can\u2019t remember the first time he was exposed to the aphorisms of Ben Franklin,\nbut they fueled an ineffaceable admiration for the eclectic and eccentric statesman and inventor. Charlie\u2019s parents, Al and Florence\nMunger, encouraged reading and gave each of their children several books at Christmas, usually devoured by that night.\n\nAt the nearby home of the Mungers\u2019 close friends, the Davises, Charlie often read the medical journals belonging to Dr. Ed Davis,\nwho was both his father\u2019s best friend and a family physician. Charlie\u2019s early exposure to Dr. Davis\u2019s medical library spawned a\nlifelong interest in science. By the time he was 14, the precocious learner had also become one of the doctor\u2019s best friends. Charlie\nbecame so interested in medicine that he watched motion pictures of Dr. Davis, a urologist, performing surgery and became fasci-\nnated with the statistical outcomes of similar procedures in the field.\n\nAt home, Charlie developed a fondness for raising hamsters and periodically traded them with other children. Even at an early\n\nage, Charlie showed a sagacious negotiating ability and usually gained a bigger specimen or one with unusual coloring. When his\n\f"}, "003803.png": {"text": "brood grew to 35 animals, his mother ordered an end to his hobby because of the pungent odor from his basement hamster farm.\nOne of his sisters remembered years later that the family had to endure the incessant squeaking of hungry hamsters until Charlie\narrived home from school to feed them.\n\nCharlie attended Central High School, a very large public school that was recognized as a good college preparatory school. The\nteachers, mostly women, were dedicated to their work and to their students. The Central High curriculum provided a conventional\nclassic education, in which Charlie naturally excelled because of his logically driven, inquiring mind.\n\nThroughout elementary and secondary school, Charlie was younger and smaller than his classmates, having been moved ahead\ninelementary school after his mother taught him to read phonically. Too small to compete in regular high school sports, he joined.\nthe rifle team, earned a varsity letter, and eventually became team captain. His letterman\u2019s sweater (\u201ca large letter on a very small\nchest\u201d is Charlie\u2019s memory) attracted attention from coeds who wondered how such a scrawny kid could earn a varsity letter. For-\ntunately for Charlie, his father was an avid outdoorsman and duck hunter and took joy in his son\u2019s marksmanship.\n\nOmaha in the 1920s was the proverbial melting pot; different races and religions mixed socially and commercially, and crime\nwas practically unknown. Doors and vehicles were left unlocked, and a person\u2019s word was trusted implicitly. Kids played kick the\ncan on warm summer evenings and went to Saturday matinees to see the latest talkies, such as King Kong, a favorite of 8-year-old\nCharlie.\n\nThe 1930s brought hard times, and Omaha experienced the severity of the Great Depression. Charlie\u2019s observations of the\nplight of those less fortunate made a lasting impression. He saw hobos roaming the streets looking for handouts and others who\nwere willing to sweep a driveway or porch in exchange for a sandwich. Thanks to family connections, Charlie landed a boring job\ncounting passersby; it paid 40\u00a2 an hour. Charlie preferred this work to carrying heavy boxes of groceries.\n\nCharlie\u2019s grandfather was a respected federal judge, and his father followed in his footsteps to become a prosperous lawyer.\nCharlie\u2019s immediate family was not dramatically affected by the Depression, but some members of Charlie\u2019s extended family were.\nThis era provided real learning experiences for young Charlie. He witnessed the generosity and business acumen of his grandfa-\n\nther as he helped rescue a small bank in Stromsburg, Nebraska, that was owned by Charlie\u2019s uncle Tom. Because of the miserable\n\f"}, "003804.png": {"text": "economy and drought-damaged crops, the bank\u2019s farm-based clients were defaulting on loans. Tom had rolled up $35,000 in\nuncollectible notes when he called upon Grandpa Munger for support. The judge risked nearly half of his assets by exchanging\n$35,000 in sound first mortgages for the bank\u2019s weak loans, thus enabling Tom to open his doors after Roosevelt\u2019s bank holiday.\nThe judge eventually recovered most of his investment, but not until a great many years later.\n\nJudge Munger also sent his daughter's husband, a musician, to pharmacy school and helped him buy a well-located pharmacy\nthat had closed because of the Depression. The business prospered and secured the future for Charlie\u2019s aunt. Charlie learned that\nby supporting each other, the Mungers weathered the worst economic collapse in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nFortunately, Al Munger\u2019s law practice prospered during the Depression and was given a boost when the United States Supreme\nCourt agreed to review a tax case involving a small soap-making company he represented. Coincidently, the huge Colgate-Palmo-\nlive Company was also affected by the court\u2019s decision. Concerned that the Midwestern attorney didn\u2019t have the requisite experi-\nence to argue successfully before the highest court, Colgate offered to pay Al liberally to step aside and allow a famous New York\nattorney to take his place. The big-city lawyer lost the case while Al pocketed a substantial fee. Later, Al joked that he could have\nlost the case just as well for a much smaller fee. The amount of the fee has never been revealed, but it was enough, when combined\nwith income Al earned from his other clients, to help keep the Mungers comfortable during the Depression. Charlie also helped the\nfamily by working to earn his own spending money and thus learned firsthand the value of financial independence.\n\nIn 1941, as the war raged across the Atlantic, Charlie graduated from Central High School and left Omaha for the University of\nMichigan. There he chose mathematics as his major, drawn by the appeal of numerical logic and reason. He also discovered physics\nafter enrolling in a basic course to fulfill an academic requirement for science. Charlie was fascinated by the power of physics and\nits boundless reach. In particular, he was impressed by the process followed by physicists such as Albert Einstein to address the\nunknown. Physics-like problem-solving was to become a passion for Charlie and is a skill he considers helpful in framing the prob-\nlems of life. He has often stated that anyone who wants to be successful should study physics because its concepts and formulas so\n\nbeautifully demonstrate the powers of sound theory.\n\f"}, "003805.png": {"text": "College-aged men were then in high demand for military service. Days after turning 19 and completing his second year at\nMichigan, Charlie enlisted in the Army Air Corps in a program that would eventually make him a second lieutenant. He was sent to\nthe Albuquerque campus of the University of New Mexico for studies in general science and engineering. Next, he was shuffled to\nthe prestigious California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. He was schooled in thermodynamics and the science of\nmeteorology\u2014then essential to flyers\u2014and trained to become a meteorologist. After completing his studies at Caltech, Charlie was\ndispatched to a permanent duty station in Nome, Alaska.\n\nWhile still in the service, he married Nancy Huggins, a young woman from Pasadena who was a good friend of his sister Mary at\nScripps College. They were stationed in Albuquerque and then San Antonio until Charlie was discharged from the Army Air Corps\nin 1946. Soon Charlie and Nancy had their first child, a boy whom they named Teddy.\n\nAlthough he had attended several universities, Charlie still did not have a bachelor\u2019s degree. Nevertheless, using the GI Bill, he\napplied to Harvard Law School, where his father had preceded him. His lack of an undergraduate degree threatened to derail him,\nbut a family friend, former Harvard Law School dean Roscoe Pound, interceded on Charlie\u2019s behalf. Charlie was admitted, despite\nthe determination of the admissions office to first send him back to college.\n\nAs it turned out, Charlie had little trouble succeeding at Harvard, though he annoyed a few people along the way. Because of his\nintellect (the Army measured his IQ at the top of the curve), Charlie had a tendency to be abrupt, which was often interpreted as\nrudeness. Actually, Charlie was just in a hurry, and the customary pleasantries of the classroom were of little concern to him. Even\nso, he was liked by most of his peers and fully enjoyed the social aspects of student life in Cambridge.\n\nCharlie graduated from Harvard Law School in 1948 and was one of 12 in his class of 335 to graduate magna cum laude. He\nconsidered joining his father\u2019s law practice, but after a discussion with his father, both of them concluded that Charlie should try\na larger city. He headed off to Southern California, a place he had liked while a student at Caltech. After passing the California bar\nexam, he joined the firm of Wright & Garrett, later renamed Musick, Peeler & Garrett. Charlie built a house, designed by his archi-\ntect uncle, Frederick Stott, in South Pasadena, where he and Nancy and their three children, Teddy, Molly, and Wendy, lived.\n\f"}, "003806.png": {"text": "Despite outward appearances, all was not sunny in Charlie\u2019s world. His marriage was in trouble, and he and his wife finally\ndivorced in 1953. Not long thereafter, Charlie learned that his adored son, Teddy, was terminally ill with leukemia. It was a sig-\nnificant burden for 29-year-old Charlie. In that era, before bone marrow transplants, there was no hope. A friend remembers that\nCharlie would visit his dying son in the hospital and then walk the streets of Pasadena crying.\n\nDuring this sad time, his friend and law partner, Roy Tolles, arranged through a friend for Charlie to meet Nancy Barry Borth-\nwick, who lived in Los Angeles. She was a Stanford graduate and had two small boys, close to the ages of his girls. Charlie and\nNancy had much in common and had fun together, and after a few months of dating became engaged. They were married ina\nsmall family wedding in January 1956, and all four children\u2014his girls and her boys, aged 4 to 7\u2014attended the wedding.\n\nCharlie and Nancy lived in her house in the hills of West Los Angeles for several years. Then, partly to shorten Charlie's daily\ncommute, they moved to Hancock Park, where they still reside. The house they built there was large enough for their ever-ex-\npanding family: three more boys and a girl, for a total of eight. Fortunately, both liked children! They also liked golf, the beach, and\nsocial clubs. Charlie and Nancy were soon members of the University Club, the California Club, the Los Angeles Country Club, and\nthe Beach Club.\n\nWith many new responsibilities, Charlie worked hard at his law practice. Even so, his earnings were unsatisfactory to him as\nthey were based on a combination of billable hours and seniority. He wanted more than what a senior law partner would be able to\nearn. He sought to be like his firm's leading capitalist clients, in particular the universally admired Harvey Mudd, later the founder\nof the college bearing his name. With Nancy\u2019s support, he turned to outside ventures and alternative ways to generate income.\nHowever, he never forgot the sound principles taught by his grandfather: to concentrate on the task immediately in front of him\nand to control spending.\n\nFollowing this conservative approach, Charlie seized opportunities to build wealth. He began investing in stocks and acquired\nequity in one of his clients\u2019 electronics businesses, a practice common among lawyers in the mid-1950s and 1960s. This invest-\nment was mutually beneficial: Charlie gained invaluable knowledge about business, while his client enjoyed the proactive atten-\n\ntion of a lawyer who knew more than just the law.\n\f"}, "003807.png": {"text": "In 1961, Charlie tackled property development for the first time, in partnership with Otis Booth, a client and friend. The\nventure, building condominiums on land near Caltech, was a smashing success, and the partners earned a handsome profit of\n$300,000 on a $100,000 investment. Charlie and Otis then undertook other successful construction and development projects in\nPasadena. Later, Charlie participated in similar projects in Alhambra, California. He sharpened his business acumen by handling\nthe negotiations and contracts. In all cases, he left all of his profits in real estate ventures so that bigger and bigger projects became\npossible. When he stopped in 1964, he had a nest egg of $1.4 million from real estate projects alone.\n\nIn February 1962, he joined four colleagues from Musick, Peeler & Garrett in establishing a new law firm. The original partners\nwere Roy Tolles, Rod Hills, Dick Esbenshade, Fred Warder, and Charlie. They were joined by Rod\u2019s wife, Carla, and James T. Wood,\n\na sole practitioner and friend of the Hills. They named the firm Munger, Tolles & Hills. Over the years, the firm had several names,\nalways beginning with Munger, Tolles. With the addition of Ron Olson, it finally became Munger, Tolles & Olson, shortened as\nMunger, Tolles or MTO.\n\nThe successful practice of law was by then a backstop rather than an ending objective for Charlie. At about the time that he was\nlaunching his new law firm, he was carefully crafting his exit plan. Charlie set up an investment partnership with Jack Wheeler,\nand they were later joined by Al Marshall. The idea for this partnership arose a few years earlier when the death of Charlie\u2019s father\nrequired him to return to Omaha to administer the estate. To welcome him home, the children of Charlie\u2019s friend and medical\nmentor, Dr. Ed Davis, arranged for a dinner party. Both of the Davis boys, Eddie Jr. and Neil, were former childhood chums of\nCharlie and were now physicians, while their sister Willa had married an Omaha businessman, Lee Seemann. The dinner party in-\ncluded Willa and Lee, Neil and his wife Joan, and a fellow named Warren Buffett.\n\nCharlie recognized Warren's family name from his days at Buffett & Son, and Warren had heard of Charlie a few years earlier\nwhen he was raising investment capital in Omaha. At one point, Warren had met with Dr. Davis and his wife, Dorothy, to explain\nhis investment philosophy, and they agreed to place a large part of their life savings\u2014$100,000\u2014with him. Why? The doctor ex-\nplained that Warren reminded him of Charlie Munger. Warren didn\u2019t know Charlie but already had at least one good reason to like\nhim.\n\f"}, "003808.png": {"text": "During the homecoming dinner, Charlie and Warren realized they shared many ideas. It also became evident to the others at\nthe table that this was going to be a two-way conversation. As the evening progressed, the two young men\u2014Warren was 29 and\nCharlie 35\u2014became engrossed in a wide-ranging dialogue covering many aspects of business, finance, and history. Where one was\nknowledgeable, the other was just as excited to learn.\n\nWarren was unenthusiastic about Charlie\u2019s continued practice of law. He said that while law might be a good hobby for Charlie,\nit was a far less promising business than what Warren was doing. Warren\u2019s logic helped Charlie to decide to quit law practice at the\nearliest point he could afford to do so.\n\nWhen Charlie returned to Los Angeles, the conversations continued via telephone and lengthy letters, sometimes as long as\nnine pages. It was evident to both that they were meant to be in business together. There was no formal partnership or contractual\nrelationship\u2014the bond was created by a handshake and backed by two Midwesterners who understood and respected the value of\none\u2019s word.\n\nThere were many benefits to their partnership: friendship, investment opportunities, and the unique ability to grasp each\nother\u2019s ideas and observations. Later, the two organizations they headed were also beneficiaries. As Warren was investing in and\nacquiring companies, he sent business to Munger, Tolles, a practice that allowed him over time to benefit from having one of the\nnation\u2019s top law firms at his disposal. Munger, Tolles, meanwhile, not only got Buffett\u2019s legal fees but also gained because his repu-\ntation attracted other blue-chip clients to the firm.\n\nMunger, Tolles is not just about money, though. Mirroring the way Charlie conducts his personal life, the firm has an enviable\nrecord of quietly providing pro bono assistance to support groups for impoverished and disadvantaged people in the Los Angeles\ncommunity. To this day, Charlie continues to influence the firm\u2019s attorneys, reminding them, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to take the last dol-\nlar\u201d and \u201cChoose clients as you would friends.\u201d Though Charlie left the firm as an active partner in 1965 after only three years, his\nindelible influence remains, as indicated by the fact that his name still heads the listing of 175 attorneys. When he left, he didn\u2019t\ntake his share of the firm\u2019s capital. Instead, he directed that his share go to the estate of his young partner, Fred Warder, who left\nbehind a wife and children when he died of cancer.\n\f"}, "003809.png": {"text": "Charlie's plan for financial independence was soon working with great success. He spent much time building the asset base\nof Wheeler, Munger & Co., his investment partnership with Jack Wheeler. He also spent time working on various real estate de-\nvelopments. All was going as planned, with no significant reverses. At Wheeler, Munger & Co., Charlie was investing in stocks\npartly with his own money and partly with other people\u2019s money. Charlie concentrated more on putting his capital to work than\nattracting new clients. Because Jack Wheeler held two seats on the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, the partnership paid low trading\ncommissions while Wheeler, Munger kept the overhead cost at close to zero.\n\nAs time passed, Charlie and Warren kept up their frequent telephone conversations and letters, sharing ideas and investment\nconcepts. Sometimes they would agree to invest in the same company. Other times they went in different directions. In time,\ntheir independent portfolios had overlapping investments. Warren invested in the Blue Chip Stamp Co. and became the largest\nsingle shareholder. Charlie became the second-largest shareholder, and, eventually, Berkshire Hathaway ended up acquiring the\ncompany.\n\nCharlie built the Wheeler, Munger partnership from 1962 through 1975. It did exceptionally well for the first 11 years, com-\npounding at 28.3 percent gross (20 percent net) versus 6.7 percent for the Dow, without a single down year. But the partnership\nwas hit hard in the vicious bear market of 1973 and 1974 when it fell 31.9 percent and 31.5 percent in back-to-back years, as the\npartnership\u2019s largest holdings, Blue Chip Stamps and New America Fund, fell sharply. This decline was despite, as Charlie puts it,\n\u201chaving its major investments virtually sure of eventually being saleable at prices higher than the quoted market prices.\u201d But the\npartnership rebounded strongly in 1975, rising 73.2 percent, bringing the overall record over 14 years to 19.8 percent (13.7 per-\ncent net) compounded annual returns versus 5 percent for the Dow.\n\nAfter this difficult experience, Charlie followed Warren in concluding that he no longer wanted to manage funds directly for\ninvestors. (Warren had closed his own partnerships in 1969.) Instead, they resolved to build equity through stock ownership in\na holding company. When Wheeler, Munger was liquidated, its stakeholders received shares in Blue Chip Stamps and Diversified\n\nRetailing. Later, these shares were converted into Berkshire Hathaway stock, which ended 1975 at $38. Today, each share is worth\n\f"}, "003810.png": {"text": "more than $85,000, making Charlie a member of the Forbes list of the 400 wealthiest individuals. While he doesn\u2019t mind the\nwealth, he regrets having his name on any such list. Despite his healthy self-image, Charlie would prefer to be anonymous.\n\nThe story of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s extraordinary success under Warren and Charlie\u2019s leadership has been told many times\nelsewhere, so the details won't be repeated here. To summarize, however, they have a spectacular track record of identifying un-\ndervalued companies and then either buying large stakes in the public markets or acquiring them outright. Regarding the latter,\nthey have acquired a diverse assortment of businesses such as Johns Manville, The Buffalo Evening News, FlightSafety Interna-\ntional, NetJets, Shaw Carpet, Benjamin Moore, GEICO, and Dairy Queen. In addition, they have purchased meaningful stakes in\npublic companies such as The Washington Post, Coca-Cola, Gillette, and American Express. For the most part, they have held their\nmajor investments for the long term\u2014in fact, they still own almost every business they\u2019ve ever acquired outright.\n\nCharlie's affinity for Benjamin Franklin\u2019s expansive career in government, business, finance, and industry can be found in his\n\nmany speeches and whenever he holds an audience, large or small. At the 75th anniversary of See\u2019s Candies, Charlie said:\n\nIam a biography nut myself. And I think when you're trying to teach the great concepts that work, it helps to tie them\ninto the lives and personalities of the people who developed them. I think you learn economics better if you make\nAdam Smith your friend. That sounds funny, making friends among the \u201ceminent dead,\u201d but if you go through life\nmaking friends with the eminent dead who had the right ideas, I think it will work better for you in life and work better\n\nin education. It\u2019s way better than just giving the basic concepts.\n\nFranklin used his self-made wealth to achieve financial independence so he could concentrate on societal improvement. Charlie\nadmires that trait in his mentor and strives to emulate Franklin. He has had a long involvement with Good Samaritan Hospital and\nHarvard-Westlake School, both in Los Angeles, and has chaired the boards of each. He and Nancy have also long supported Stan-\n\nford University and the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California.

MUNGER JR.\n\nOn the last day of a family ski vacation in Sun Valley when I was 15 or so, my dad and I were driving back in the snow when he took\na 10-minute detour to gas the red Jeep we were driving. He was pressed for time to have our family catch the plane home, so I was\nsurprised to notice as he pulled into the station that the tank was still half full. 1asked my dad why we had stopped when we had\nplenty of gas, and he admonished me, \u201cCharlie, when you borrow a man\u2019s car, you always return it with a full tank of gas.\u201d\n\nMy freshman year at Stanford, an acquaintance lent me his car, more because friends we had in common twisted his arm than\nbecause he knew me all that well. The tank was half full, and the Audi Fox was red. So I remembered the Jeep and topped up the\ntank before I brought the car back. He noticed. We've had a lot of good times since, and he stood as a groomsman at my wedding.\n\nAfter Stanford, I learned that on that vacation we had been staying at Rick Guerin\u2019s house and driving Rick Guerin\u2019s Jeep.

He could really warm to the topic of apocalyptic consequences. He used such\nextreme and horrific examples that we were often simultaneously groaning and laughing by the time he finished.

As soon as this officer realized his mistake, he went to the president of the company and told him about it.

(HAL) BORTHWICK\n\nIt has been a fascinating and wonderful 50 years (nearly) since Charlie and my mother were married. There were many opportuni-\n\nties that I offered Charlie for formative education. Here are a couple:\n\nDo the job right the first time\n\nThis story goes back to Minnesota times. One of my jobs as a driving-age teen was to pick up and deliver the housekeeper from the\ntown of Cass Lake. This wasn\u2019t just a drive down the street; the boat had to be driven across the lake to the marina, where I would\nhop into the car to drive to town, and then the process was reversed. Part of my job in the morning was to pick up a newspaper\nwhile I was in town.\n\nWell, one day a big storm blew in: rain, waves, wind, etc., big time. With all the excitement and difficulty, I did get to town in\nthe morning and returned with the maid, but I forgot the paper. Charlie and I had a one-second or so discussion after I answered\nthe question \u201cWhere's my paper?\u201d in the negative. \u201cGo back and get the paper and never forget it again!\u201d So back I went through the\nstorm to get the paper, bouncing in the waves with rain sheeting off the boat, thinking to myself that I wasn\u2019t going to allow any-\n\nthing like this ever to happen again.\n\nBe responsible\n\nCharlie\u2019s mother drove herself from Omaha to Minnesota each summer. When she was there, we used her car for errands.

While he certainly wanted the children to groove their groundstrokes, there was a bit more to\nit than that. For it was Father who was out on the court more than anyone, with the machine positioned so he could endlessly\npractice-volley close by the net. Before long, he mastered the well-placed easy put-away volleys, the kinds of shots everyone else\ninstinctively tried to kill but usually hit into the net or 10 feet out. By working on the tennis version of golf\u2019s short game, which\nfew others could be bothered to practice, Father, as he\u2019s done throughout his life, gave himself a fair if maddening competitive ad-\nvantage. I really dreaded playing against him, especially in doubles, where the net play really counts. Thank God it was tennis, not\nbusiness.\n\nThinking about Father made me remember a long-ago humorous TV beer ad in which a smartly dressed man at a table is so\nengrossed in his glass of beer as to be oblivious to a rampaging bull charging a bullfighter right in front of him. He doesn\u2019t flinch,\neven when the bull smashes the table into matchsticks.

Whatever\nwas on his mind, it wasn\u2019t the outcome of a football game or a botched golf shot.

I can be\n\nnothing but glad, and grateful, for the touch of my father\u2019s hands in mine, and in my son's.\n\nFROM BARRY MUNGER\n\nSeveral years ago, I came across a book by Calvin Trillin called Messages from My Father, a memoir about Trillin\u2019s father, Abe, who\nwas born in Ukraine, grew up in Missouri, and spent much of his career operating neighborhood grocery stores in Kansas City. Abe\nTrillin regarded thrift as a moral virtue, paid his bills the day they arrived, and got up at 4 in the morning, six days a week, to pick\nthe produce for his stores. A man of few words, he was nevertheless convivial, trenchantly funny, and spoke naturally to small\nchildren. He was skilled at cards. He was sardonic but had an underlying optimism that one could get along in the world with the\nproper outlook and character.\n\nThe fact that my father shares many of these qualities, even if he\u2019s not known for his discernment about produce, does not fully\nexplain my attachment to this light, deft, and anecdotal little book. Reading it somehow conjures my father for me, even though\nin the broad outlines of his life my father has almost nothing in common with Abe Trillin, other than the fact that my father once\nworked part-time at a Midwestern grocery store, Buffett & Son in Omaha.\n\nLike my father, Abe Trillin had a fundamental reserve, partially Midwestern in origin, that was at odds with his personable\nqualities. He did not regard a long drive in a car or a fishing outing as an opportunity to catch up. He did not linger on the tele-\nphone. His son eventually came to marvel at \u201chow much my father managed to get across to me without those heart-to-hearts that\nI\u2019ve read about fathers and sons having in the study or in the rowboat or in the car.\u201d The title Messages from My Father comes from\nthe author\u2019s surmise that his father must have been communicating his expectations through coded messages. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that\n\nmy father had a code so subtle that I didn\u2019t know of its existence,\u201d he writes.\n\f"}, "003820.png": {"text": "Anyone who knows my father knows that his manner of expression is not always subtle, but he has many ways of sending his\nmessages.

In both instances, he appears blunt and avuncular\u2014that inimitable Charlie\n\u2014but at the card table, he uses a lack of indirection for harmless ribbing, and at the dinner table, he uses indirection to spare feel-\n\nings. He\u2019s more subtle than he appears.\n\n \n\nA friend of mine recently began an anecdote about my father by saying, \u201cSo your dad\u2019s sitting in his chair, like Rushmore\nknew exactly what he meant. Not many people can summon up the image of a 5,700-foot granite mountain and the faces of four\npresidents simply by taking possession of an upholstered chair, but my father can. All of the Munger children have at one time or\nanother approached Rushmore to make a request and felt like Dorothy approaching Oz, except that Oz was more voluble. Rush-\nmore did not always respond. Sometimes my father made a low steady noise from somewhere around his larynx, as though Rush-\nmore had gone volcanic, but that was not so easy to interpret. Can you be more subtle than silent?\n\nUnlike Abe Trillin, perhaps, my father really does send messages, in the form of speeches he has written, letters he has received\nand sent, and articles from varied sources about social policy, psychology, business ethics, and law, among other topics. Many of\nthem appear in this book. What doesn\u2019t appear is the note my father scrawled on the enclosure. The note is usually extremely brief,\nand often just a \u201csend to\u201d list, but every once in a while the note will have a wry fillip, like this one from 1996, which was appended\ntoa long, appreciative letter from a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder in Sweden: \u201cI hope you find this amusing,\u201d my father wrote.\n\u201cIf only I had the influence with my wife and children that I have in some other quarters!\u201d\n\nWhen I finished the Trillin book, I sent it to my father. Even if he didn\u2019t recognize himself in it, I figured he would enjoy the\nbook\u2019s Midwestern milieu, the immigrant striving of the Trillin family, and the humor. The book is written with so much affection\nthat I thought I could even use it to communicate such feelings to my dad indirectly, which is the preferred route.

Not much escapes my father, however. It turned out that he had simply instructed\n\nhis secretary to send copies to the whole family.\n\nFROM PHILIP MUNGER\n\nSome of my most affectionate memories of my father are of shopping for clothes at Brooks Brothers and Marks & Spencer. Most\npeople already know that Father is not a big fashion man. He once said that he was nonconformist enough in his behavior and\nopinions that it made sense to chart a very straight course in attire. His going along with normal social customs and his sense of\nhumor, he said, were what allowed his otherwise sometimes prickly temperament to harmonize with other people.\n\nI vividly recall going with my father to Brooks Brothers, when it was still housed in that beautiful old wood-paneled building in\ndowntown Los Angeles, to buy my first serious suit. I must have been about 11 or 12. I can see those polished brass elevator doors\nopening. We looked through the racks. Father picked out a pinstriped, charcoal gray suit. When I was 16, we went to buy another\nsuit, this time a three-piece, which I wore religiously during my debate days. It kept the icy wind blowing off the lake at Northwest-\nern during a tournament at bay. We bought, at the same time, a pair of wingtip shoes for my summer stint at The Daily Journal (a\ncoming-of-age ceremony required by Father for each boy), shoes which have lasted to this day. There is another theme here. When\nwe bought a brown tweed coat at Marks & Spencer in London, Father said, \u201cThis will always keep its crease.\u201d He admired both\nstores because they were durable institutions and because their merchandise was too, and fairly priced. Durability has always been\na first-rate virtue in my father\u2019s view, along with ritual and tradition. He never had a desire to change his primary habits, sartorial\n\nor otherwise, once he had, like Franklin, acquired them.\n\f"}, "003822.png": {"text": "I still shop at Brooks, partly because each year at Christmas Father gives every child a gift card, which is perfectly timed for the\nwinter sale.

I think of my father every time I go; I\u2019m very attached to the place.\nWhen I went to study at Oxford, in winter 1988, he gave me an old Brooks coat of his, dating from the \u201940s, of a sort of tannish-\nolive hue, I think, with a warm zip-in lining. As I walked home from the Bodleian Library each night, that nasty, damp, penetrating\nEnglish cold would not get through.

Much of Franklin\u2019s success was due to the essential\nnature of the man\u2014most especially his appetite for hard work, but also his insatiable curiosity and patient demeanor. Above all,\nhe possessed a quick and willing mind that enabled him to easily master each new field of endeavor he chose to undertake.

Like Franklin, Charlie has made himself into a grandmaster of preparation, patience, discipline,\nand objectivity. He has parlayed these attributes into great success in both his personal and business endeavors, especially in his\ninvesting.\n\nTo Charlie, successful investing is simply a by-product of his carefully organized and focused approach to life.

Instead, it is a general overview of how he seems to do it. Our goal here is to present the basic outline\nof Charlie\u2019s approach to prepare you for the voluminous details that follow in the rest of the book. If you are anxious to get to the\nheart of the matter, the Eleven Talks section\u2014presented verbatim in Charlie\u2019s own words\u2014is the best source for exacting how-to\nadvice on a broad range of topics. Here we will content ourselves with a presentation of the general thought processes Charlie em-\n\nploys when considering an investment, followed by an outline of his guiding investment principles.\n\nMUNGER\u2019S \u201cMULTIPLE MENTAL MODELS\u201d APPROACH TO BUSINESS ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT\n\nCharlie\u2019s approach to investing is quite different from the more rudimentary systems used by most investors. Instead of making a\nsuperficial stand-alone assessment of a company\u2019s financial information, Charlie conducts a comprehensive analysis of both the\ninternal workings of the investment candidate as well as the larger, integrated ecosystem in which it operates. He calls the tools he\nuses to conduct this review his multiple mental models. These models, discussed at length in several of the talks (especially Talks\nTwo, Three, and Four), serve as a framework for gathering, processing, and acting on information. They borrow from and neatly\nstitch together the analytical tools, methods, and formulas from such traditional disciplines as history, psychology, physiology,\nmathematics, engineering, biology, physics, chemistry, statistics, economics, and so on.\n\nThe unassailable logic of Charlie\u2019s ecosystem approach to investment analysis: Just as multiple factors shape almost every\nsystem, multiple models from a variety of disciplines, applied with fluency, are needed to understand that system. As John Muir\nobserved about the interconnectedness of nature, \u201cWhen we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else\n\nin the universe.\u201d\n\f"}, "003825.png": {"text": "Charlie seeks to discover the universe hitched to each of his investment candidates by gaining a firm grasp on all, or at least\nmost, of the relevant factors comprising both its internal and external environment. When properly collected and organized, his\nmultiple mental models (about 100 in number, he estimates) provide a context, or latticework, that leads to remarkable insights\nas to the purpose and nature of life. More pertinent to our purpose here, his models supply the analytical structure that enables\nhim to reduce the inherent chaos and confusion of a complex investment problem into a clarified set of fundamentals. Especially\nimportant examples of these models include the redundancy and backup system models from engineering; the compound interest\nmodel from mathematics; the breakpoint, tipping moment, and autocatalysis models from physics and chemistry; the modern\nDarwinian synthesis model from biology; and cognitive misjudgment models from psychology.\n\nThe net result of this broad-spectrum analysis is a heightened understanding of how the many factors affecting an investment\ncandidate blend and link to one another. Sometimes this understanding reveals the existence of second-order, ripple, or spillover\neffects. Other times the factors employed combine to create enormous \u201clollapalooza-level\u201d results, good or bad. By applying this\nframework, Charlie lives in a different world from most investors when it comes to investment analysis. His approach accepts the\nreality that investment problems are inherently complex, and in a manner more in keeping with the rigors of scientific inquiry\nthan conventional investing, he attacks them with a staggering degree of preparation and broad-based research.\n\nCharlie's \u201cbig ideas from the big disciplines\u201d approach to investment evaluation is certainly unique in the business world\u2014\nas is its origin. Not finding any existing approach adequate to the task, Charlie painstakingly created his own largely self-taught\nsystem. The \u201cself-taught\u201d statement is no exaggeration; he once said, \u201cTo this day, I have never taken any course, anywhere, in\nchemistry, economics, psychology, or business.\u201d And yet these disciplines, especially psychology, form the foundation upon which\nhis system is built.\n\nIt is this signature approach, backed by Charlie\u2019s formidable intellect, temperament, and decades of relevant experience, that\nhave made him the virtuoso of business pattern recognition so valued by Buffett. Like a chess grandmaster, through logic, instinct,\nand intuition, he determines the most promising investment moves, all the while projecting the illusion that the insight came eas-\n\nily, even simply. But make no mistake: This simplicity comes only at the end of a long journey toward understanding\u2014not at the\n\f"}, "003826.png": {"text": "beginning. His clarity is hard-won, the product of a lifetime of studying the patterns of human behavior, business systems, and a\nmyriad of other scientific disciplines.\n\nCharlie counts preparation, patience, discipline, and objectivity among his most fundamental guiding principles. He will not\ndeviate from these principles, regardless of group dynamics, emotional itches, or popular wisdom that \u201cthis time around it\u2019s differ-\nent.\u201d When faithfully adhered to, these traits result in one of the best-known Munger characteristics: not buying or selling very\noften. Munger, like Buffett, believes a successful investment career boils down to only a handful of decisions. So when Charlie likes\na business, he makes a very large bet and typically holds the position for a long period. Charlie calls it \u201csit-on-your-ass investing\u201d\nand cites its benefits: \u201cYou're paying less to brokers, you're listening to less nonsense, and if it works, the tax system gives you an\nextra 1, 2, or 3 percentage points per annum.\u201d In his view, a portfolio of three companies is plenty of diversification. Accordingly,\nCharlie is willing to commit uncommonly high percentages of his investment capital to individual, \u201cfocused\u201d opportunities. Finda\n\u2018Wall Street organization, financial adviser, or mutual fund manager willing to make that statement!\n\nGiven Charlie\u2019s record of success, not to mention Buffett\u2019s endorsement, why aren't his investment practices more routinely\nemulated by others? Perhaps the answer is that, for most people, Charlie\u2019s multidisciplinary approach is simply too hard. Further,\nfew investors share Charlie\u2019s willingness to appear foolish by not following the herd. Religious in his objectivity, Charlie is content\nto swim imperturbably against the tide of popular opinion\u2014indefinitely, if necessary\u2014which is a rare attribute in the average in-\nvestor. And while this behavior can at times appear simply stubborn or contrarian, that is not the defining characteristic. Charlie is\nsimply content to trust his own judgment even when it runs counter to the wisdom of the herd. This lone-wolf aspect of Charlie\u2019s\ntemperament is a rarely appreciated reason why he consistently outperforms the larger investment community. Indeed, if tem-\nperament chiefly arises from inborn tendencies, it may be that hard work, intellect, and experience, regardless of their intensity,\nare by themselves insufficient to make a great investor like Charlie Munger. As we shall witness throughout the remainder of this\nbook, the right kind of genetically predetermined wiring is needed as well.\n\nAt the 2004 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, a young shareholder asked Buffett how to succeed in life. After Buffett shared\n\nhis thoughts, Charlie chimed in: \u201cDon\u2019t do cocaine. Don\u2019t race trains. And avoid AIDS situations.\u201d Many would dismiss his seem-\n\f"}, "003827.png": {"text": "ingly flippant answer as merely humorous (which it certainly was), but in fact it faithfully reflects both his general views on avoid-\ning trouble in life and his particular method for avoiding missteps in investing.\n\nOften, as in this case, Charlie generally focuses first on what to avoid\u2014that is, on what not to do\u2014before he considers the\naffirmative steps he will take in a given situation. \u201cAll I want to know is where I\u2019m going to die, so I\u2019ll never go there\u201d is one of his\nfavorite quips. In business, as in life, Charlie gains enormous advantage by summarily eliminating the unpromising portions of\nthe chessboard, freeing his time and attention for the more productive regions. Charlie strives to reduce complex situations to\ntheir most basic, unemotional fundamentals. Yet, within this pursuit of rationality and simplicity, he is careful to avoid what he\ncalls physics envy, the common human craving to reduce enormously complex systems (such as those in economics) to one-size-\nfits-all Newtonian formulas. Instead, he faithfully honors Albert Einstein\u2019s admonition: \u201cA scientific theory should be as simple as\npossible, but no simpler.\u201d Or, in his own words: \u201cWhat I\u2019m against is being very confident and feeling that you know, for sure, that\nyour particular action will do more good than harm. You're dealing with highly complex systems wherein everything is interact-\ning with everything else.\u201d\n\nAnother Benjamin\u2014Graham, not Franklin\u2014played a significant role in forming Charlie\u2019s investing outlook. One of the most\nenduring concepts in Graham\u2019s The Intelligent Investor is Mr. Market. Usually, Mr. Market is a temperate and reasonable fellow, but\nsome days he is gripped by irrational fear or greed. Graham cautioned the investor to carefully use his own unemotional judgment\nof value instead of relying on the often manic-depressive behavior of the financial markets. Similarly, Charlie recognizes that even\namong the most competent and motivated of people, decisions are not always made on a purely rational basis. For this reason, he\nconsiders the psychological factors of human misjudgment some of the most important mental models that can be applied to an\n\ninvestment opportunity:\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve gotten so that I now use a kind of two-track analysis. First, what are the factors that really govern the\ninterests involved, rationally considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain, at a sub-\n\nconscious level, is automatically doing these things\u2014which, by and large, are useful but which often misfunction? One\n\f"}, "003828.png": {"text": "approach is rationality, the way you'd work out a bridge problem: by evaluating the real interests, the real probabili-\nties, and so forth. And the other is to evaluate the psychological factors that cause subconscious conclusions, many of\n\nwhich are wrong.\n\nFor more specifics on this topic see Talk Eleven, in which Charlie applies mental models from the field of psychology to illus-\ntrate 25 common causes of human misjudgment.\n\nObviously, the methods described to this point can\u2019t be learned in a university classroom or on Wall Street. They were developed\nby Charlie, from scratch, to satisfy his own exacting requirements. They probably deserve a title of their own, something like\n\u201cQuickly eliminate the big universe of what not to do; follow up with a fluent, multidisciplinary attack on what remains; then act\ndecisively when, and only when, the right circumstances appear.\u201d\n\nIs it worth the effort to develop and adhere to such an approach? Charlie seems to think so: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of fun to sit there and out-\nthink people who are way smarter than you are because you've trained yourself to be more objective and more multidisciplinary.\n\nFurthermore, there is a lot of money in it, as I can testify from my own personal experience.\u201d\n\nMUNGER\u2019S INVESTMENT EVALUATION PROCESS\n\nAs we've noted, Charlie doesn\u2019t make a lot of investments. His approach is perhaps best summarized by Thomas Watson Sr., the\nfounder of IBM: \u201cI\u2019m no genius. I\u2019m smart in spots, and I stay around those spots.\u201d If Charlie knows anything, he knows his spots:\nhis carefully identified circles of competence. To stay within these circles, he first applies a basic, overall screen, designed to limit\nhis investment field to only \u201csimple, understandable candidates.\u201d As he says, \u201cWe have three baskets for investing: yes, no, and too\n\ntough to understand.\u201d\n\f"}, "003829.png": {"text": "To identify potential \u201cyes\u201d candidates, Charlie looks for an easy-to-understand, dominant business franchise that can sustain\nitself and thrive in all market environments. Understandably, few companies survive this first cut. Many investor favorites such as\npharmaceuticals and technology, for example, go straight to the \u201ctoo-tough-to-understand\u201d basket. Heavily promoted \u201cdeals\u201d and\nIPOs earn immediate nos. Those that do survive this first winnowing are subjected to the screens and filters of Charlie\u2019s mental-\nmodels approach. The process is intense and Darwinian but also efficient. Charlie detests placer mining, the process of sifting\nthrough piles of sand for specks of gold. Instead, he applies his \u201cbig ideas from the big disciplines\u201d to find the large, unrecognized\nnuggets of gold that sometimes lie in plain sight on the ground.\n\nThroughout his exhaustive evaluation, Charlie is no slave to a database: He takes into account all relevant aspects, both internal\nand external to the company and its industry, even if they are difficult to identify, measure, or reduce to numbers. His thorough-\nness, however, does not cause him to forget his overall ecosystem theme: Sometimes the maximization or minimization of a single\nfactor (notably specialization, as he likes to point out regarding Costco\u2019s discount warehouses) can make that single factor dispro-\nportionately important.\n\nCharlie treats financial reports and their underlying accounting with a Midwestern dose of skepticism. At best, they are merely\nthe beginning of a proper calculation of intrinsic valuation, not the end. The list of additional factors he examines is seemingly\nendless and includes such things as the current and prospective regulatory climate; the state of labor, supplier, and customer\nrelations; the potential impact of changes in technology; competitive strengths and vulnerabilities; pricing power; scalability;\nenvironmental issues; and, notably, the presence of hidden exposures. (Charlie knows that there is no such thing as a riskless\ninvestment candidate; he\u2019s searching for those with few risks that are easily understandable.) He recasts all financial statement\nfigures to fit his own view of reality, including the actual free or owners\u2019 cash being produced, inventory and other working capital\nassets, fixed assets, and such frequently overstated intangible assets as goodwill. He also completes an assessment of the true im-\npact, current and future, of the cost of stock options, pension plans, and retiree medical benefits. He applies equal scrutiny to the\nliability side of the balance sheet. For example, under the right circumstances, he might view an obligation such as insurance float\n\n\u2014premium income that may not be paid out in claims for many years\u2014more properly as an asset. He especially assesses a com-\n\f"}, "003830.png": {"text": "pany\u2019s management well beyond conventional number crunching\u2014in particular, the degree to which they are \u201cable, trustworthy,\nand owner-oriented.\u201d For example, how do they deploy cash? Do they allocate it intelligently on behalf of the owners or do they\novercompensate themselves or pursue ego-oriented growth for growth\u2019s sake?\n\nAbove all, he attempts to assess and understand competitive advantage in every respect\u2014products, markets, trademarks,\nemployees, distribution channels, societal trends, and so on\u2014and the durability of that advantage. Charlie refers to a company\u2019s\ncompetitive advantage as its moat: the virtual physical barrier it presents against incursions. Superior companies have deep moats\nthat are continuously widened to provide enduring protection. In this vein, Charlie carefully considers competitive destruction\nforces that, over the long term, lay siege to most companies. Munger and Buffett are laser-focused on this issue: Over their long\nbusiness careers they have learned, sometimes painfully, that few businesses survive over multiple generations. Accordingly, they\nstrive to identify and buy only those businesses with a good chance of beating these tough odds.\n\nFinally, Charlie seeks to calculate the intrinsic value of the whole business and, with allowance for potential dilution, etc., to\ndetermine an approximate value per share to compare to market prices. This latter comparison is the fundamental purpose of the\nwhole process\u2014comparing value (what you get) with price (what you pay). On this subject he is famous for his viewpoint that \u201ca\ngreat business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price.\u201d Warren Buffett often credits Charlie with convincing him\nof the wisdom of this approach: \u201cCharlie understood this early. I was a slow learner.\u201d Charlie\u2019s insight helped Buffett move from\npure Benjamin Graham-style investing to focusing on great businesses such as The Washington Post, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Gillette,\nand others.\n\nThough extremely thorough, Charlie is able to ignore insignificant detail and the distractions to which others sometimes fall\nvictim. Investment variables, just like all other variables, go through their own process of elimination. By the time he is finished\nwith his analysis, he has reduced the candidate to its most salient elements and achieved a remarkable degree of confidence about\nwhether or not to act. The evaluation, finally, becomes not so much mathematical as philosophical. Ultimately a \u201cfeel\u201d emerges, a\n\nfunction of both the analysis itself and Charlie\u2019s lifetime of accumulated experience and skill in recognizing patterns.\n\f"}, "003831.png": {"text": "At this point, only an exceptionally superior investment candidate will still be in the running. But Charlie does not immediately\nrush out and buy it. Knowing that a necessary companion to proper valuation is proper timing, he applies yet a finer screen,\n\na \u201cprior to pulling the trigger\u201d checklist, which is especially useful in evaluating what he refers to as close calls. The checklist\nincludes such items as: What are the current price, volume, and trading considerations? What disclosure timing or other sensitiv-\nities exist? Do contingent exit strategies exist? Are better uses of capital currently or potentially available? Is sufficient liquid capi-\ntal currently on hand or must it be borrowed? What is the opportunity cost of that capital? And so on.\n\nCharlie's exhaustive screening process requires considerable self-discipline and results in long periods of apparent inactivity.\nBut, as Charlie says, \u201cHard work is an essential element in tracking down and perfecting a strategy, or in executing it.\u201d For Charlie\nand Warren, the hard work is continuous, whether it results in current investing activity or not\u2014and usually it does not. This\nhabit of committing far more time to learning and thinking than to doing is no accident. It is the blend of discipline and patience\nexhibited by true masters of a craft: an uncompromising commitment to \u201cproperly playing the hand.\u201d Like world-class bridge\nplayer Richard Zeckhauser, Charlie scores himself not so much on whether he won the hand but rather on how well he played it.\nWhile poor outcomes are excusable in the Munger-Buffett world\u2014given the fact that some outcomes are outside of their control\u2014\nsloppy preparation and decision-making are never excusable because they are controllable.\n\nOn those relatively few occasions when all the circumstances are just right and Charlie does invest, he will likely make a large,\ndecisive bet. He does not pick around the edges, take initial positions, or make small, speculative investments. Such behavior im-\nplies uncertainty, and Charlie\u2019s moves, few as they are, are anything but uncertain. As he says, he practices \u201cextreme patience com-\nbined with extreme decisiveness.\u201d Charlie\u2019s self-confidence is based not on who, or how many, agree or disagree with him but on\nhis ability to objectively view and measure himself. This self-mastery affords him rare objectivity in gauging his actual knowledge,\nexperience, and correctness of thought. Again, we see the important role played by the right kinds of temperamental qualities:\nself-discipline, patience, calm, independence. Charlie\u2019s level of investment performance is arguably impossible without them.\n\nWhat makes a great business model for Charlie? His recommended reading materials provide some guidance. Guns, Germs, and\n\nSteel, The Selfish Gene, Ice Age, and Darwin\u2019s Blind Spot all have a certain theme: a focus on the issue of competitive destruction and\n\f"}, "003832.png": {"text": "an examination of why some entities are nevertheless able to adapt, survive, and even dominate over time. When this theme is\nextrapolated into investment selection, the preferred Munger business emerges: some thrive by outcompeting (a la Selfish Gene)\nand others by out-cooperating (ala Darwin\u2019s Blind Spot). Once again, we see Charlie\u2019s rich fluency across a broad range of disci-\nplines at work: How many investors ever consider, as Charlie routinely does, such a broad and sophisticated spectrum of factors?\nTo name but a few, he routinely considers factors such as conversion, i.e., how the laws of thermodynamics intersect with laws of\neconomics (for instance, how paper and petroleum become a newspaper delivered to a front door); psychological tendencies and\nincentives (notably the extreme behavioral pressures they create, both good and bad); and fundamental sustainability over time\n(the constant and often deadly interplay between positive factors such as moats and the ravages of competitive destruction). Char-\nlie is possibly without peer when it comes to the checklist of atypical investment factors he considers and his deep fluency in the\n\ndiverse disciplines from which they are drawn.\n\nAN INVESTING PRINCIPLES CHECKLIST\n\n\u2018We have now examined Charlie\u2019s approach to thinking in general and to investing in particular. In keeping with our intent to\nobserve how he seems to do it, we will recap his approach by using the checklist methodology he advocates. (For Charlie\u2019s own\nwords of wisdom on the value and importance of checklists, see Talk Five.) Note, however, that the following principles are most\ncertainly not employed by Charlie in a one-by-one or one-time fashion as the checklist format might seem to imply. Nor can they\nnecessarily be prioritized in terms of any apparent or relative importance. Rather, each must be considered as part of the complex\nwhole or gestalt of the investment analysis process, in much the same way that an individual tile is integral to the larger mosaic in\n\nwhich it appears.\n\f"}, "003833.png": {"text": "Risk\nAll investment evaluations should begin by measuring risk, especially reputational.\n+ Incorporate an appropriate margin of safety.\n+ Avoid dealing with people of questionable character.\n+ Insist upon proper compensation for risk assumed.\n+ Always beware of inflation and interest rate exposures.\n\n+ Avoid big mistakes; shun permanent capital loss.\n\nIndependence\n\u201cOnly in fairy tales are emperors told they are naked.\u201d\n+ Objectivity and rationality require independence of thought.\n+ Remember that just because other people agree or disagree with you doesn\u2019t make you right or wrong\u2014the only thing that mat-\nters is the correctness of your analysis and judgment.\n\n+ Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean (merely average performance).\n\nPreparation\n\n\u201cThe only way to win is to work, work, work, work, and hope to have a few insights.\u201d\n+ Develop into a lifelong self-learner through voracious reading; cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day.\n+ More important than the will to win is the will to prepare.\n\n+ Develop fluency in mental models from the major academic disciplines.\n\f"}, "003834.png": {"text": "+ If you want to get smart, the question you have to keep asking is \u201cWhy, why, why?\u201d\n\nIntellectual humility\n\nAcknowledging what you don\u2019t know is the dawning of wisdom.\n+ Stay within a well-defined circle of competence.\n+ Identify and reconcile disconfirming evidence.\n+ Resist the craving for false precision, false certainties, etc.\n\n+ Above all, never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person to fool.\n\nAnalytic rigor\nUse of the scientific method and effective checklists minimizes errors and omissions.\n+ Determine value apart from price, progress apart from activity, wealth apart from size.\n+ It is better to remember the obvious than to grasp the esoteric.\n+ Be a business analyst, not a market, macroeconomic, or security analyst.\n+ Consider the totality of risk and effect; look always at potential second-order and higher-level impacts.\n\n+ Think forward and backward: Invert, always invert.\n\nAllocation\nProper allocation of capital is an investor\u2019s number one job.\n+ Remember that the highest and best use is always measured by the next best use (opportunity cost).\n\n+ Good ideas are rare\u2014when the odds are greatly in your favor, bet (allocate) heavily.\n\f"}, "003835.png": {"text": "+ Don't fall in love with an investment\u2014be situation-dependent and opportunity-driven.\n\nPatience\n\nResist the natural human bias to act.\n+ \u201cCompound interest is the eighth wonder of the world\u201d (Einstein); never interrupt it unnecessarily.\n+ Avoid unnecessary transactional taxes and frictional costs; never take action for its own sake.\n+ Be alert for the arrival of luck.\n\n+ Enjoy the process along with the proceeds, because the process is where you live.\n\nDecisiveness\n\nWhen proper circumstances present themselves, act with decisiveness and conviction.\n+ Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\n+ Opportunity doesn\u2019t come often, so seize it when it does.\n\n+ Opportunity meeting the prepared mind\u2014that\u2019s the game.\n\nChange\n\nLive with change and accept unremovable complexity.\n+ Recognize and adapt to the true nature of the world around you; don\u2019t expect it to adapt to you.\n+ Continually challenge and willingly amend your best-loved ideas.\n\n+ Recognize reality even when you don\u2019t like it\u2014especially when you don\u2019t like it.\n\f"}, "003836.png": {"text": "Focus\nKeep things simple and remember what you set out to do.\n+ Remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets\u2014and can be lost in a heartbeat.\n+ Guard against the effects of hubris and boredom.\n+ Don't overlook the obvious by drowning in minutiae.\n+ Be careful to exclude unneeded information or slop: \u201cA small leak can sink a great ship.\u201d\n\n+ Face your big troubles, don\u2019t sweep them under the rug.\n\nSince human beings began investing, they have been searching for a magic formula or easy recipe for instant wealth. As you can\nsee, Charlie\u2019s superior performance doesn\u2019t come from a magic formula or some business school-inspired system. It comes from\nwhat he calls his \u201cconstant search for better methods of thought,\u201d from a willingness to \u201cprepay\u201d through rigorous preparation,\nand from the extraordinary outcomes of his multidisciplinary research model. In the end, it comes down to Charlie\u2019s most basic\nguiding principles, his fundamental philosophy of life: Preparation. Discipline. Patience. Decisiveness. Each attribute is, in turn,\nlost without the other, but together they form the dynamic critical mass for a cascading of positive effects for which Munger is fa-\nmous (the lollapalooza).\n\nFinally, a word or two on why this overview of Charlie\u2019s investment philosophy has focused so much on the subject of what to\nbuy and so little on when to sell. The answer, in Charlie\u2019s own words, serves as a wonderful summation of the Munger school of\n\nhighly concentrated, focused investing described here:\n\f"}, "003837.png": {"text": "We're partial to putting out large amounts of money where we won't have to make another decision.

But if you can buy a few great companies, then you can sit on your ass. That\u2019s a good thing.\n\nLike his hero, Benjamin Franklin, Charlie Munger painstakingly developed and perfected unique approaches to personal and\nbusiness endeavors.

The occasion was the graduation of Philip Munger, the\nlast of five Munger family sons to matriculate at this prep school (originally an all-boys institution and now the\ncoeducational school called Harvard-Westlake) .\n\nDespite Charlie's self-effacing protestations about lacking \u201csignificant public speaking experience,\u201d he demon-\nstrates imposing rhetorical talents in this short speech. We also get a good taste of both Charlie\u2019s value system\nand his wit. Most graduation speakers choose to lay out a prescription for attaining a happy life. Charlie, using\nthe inversion principle he recommends in the speech, compellingly makes the opposite case by setting forth what a\n\ngraduate may do to reach a state of misery.\n\f"}, "003841.png": {"text": "For those of you who want to remain unenlightened and mirthless, do not, under any circumstances, read this\nselection.\n\n \n\nNow that Headmaster Berrisford has selected one of the oldest and longest-serving trustees to make a commencement speech, it\n\nbehooves the speaker to address two questions in every mind:\n\n1. Why was such a selection made?\n\n2. How long is the speech going to last?\n\nI will answer the first question from long experience alongside Berrisford. He is seeking enhanced reputation for our school in\nthe manner of the man who proudly displays his horse that can count to seven. The man knows that counting to seven is not much\nof a mathematical feat, but he expects approval because doing so is creditable, considering the performer is a horse.\n\nThe second question, regarding the length of the speech, I am not going to answer in advance. It would deprive your upturned\nfaces of lively curiosity and obvious keen anticipation, which I prefer to retain, regardless of source.\n\nBut I will tell you how my consideration of speech length created the subject matter of the speech itself. I was puffed up when\ninvited to speak. While not having significant public speaking experience, I do hold a black belt in chutzpah, and I immediately\nconsidered Demosthenes and Cicero\u201d as role models and anticipated trying to earn a compliment like Cicero gave when asked\n\nwhich was his favorite among the orations of Demosthenes. Cicero replied, \u201cThe longest one.\u201d\n\f"}, "003842.png": {"text": "However, fortunately for this audience, I also thought of Samuel Johnson\u2019s~ famous comment when he addressed Milton\u2019s~\npoem Paradise Lost and correctly said, \u201cNo one ever wished it longer.\u201d And that made me consider which of all the 20 Harvard\nSchool graduation speeches I had heard that I had wished longer. There was only one such speech, given by Johnny Carson, spec-\nifying Carson\u2019s prescriptions for guaranteed misery in life. I, therefore, decided to repeat Carson's speech, but in expanded form\nwith some added prescriptions of my own. After all, 1am much older than Carson was when he spoke, and I have failed and been\nmiserable more often and in more ways than was possible for a charming humorist speaking at a younger age. I am plainly well\nqualified to expand on Carson\u2019s theme.\n\nWhat Carson said was that he couldn\u2019t tell the graduating class how to be happy, but he could tell them from personal experi-\n\nence how to guarantee misery. Carson\u2019s prescription for sure misery included:\n\n1. Ingesting chemicals in an effort to alter mood or perception\n2. Envy\n\n3. Resentment\n\nIcan still recall Carson\u2019s absolute conviction as he told how he had tried these things on occasion after occasion and had become\nmiserable every time.\n\nIt is easy to understand Carson\u2019s first prescription for misery, ingesting chemicals. I add my voice. The four closest friends of my\nyouth were highly intelligent, ethical, humorous types, favored in person and background. Two are long dead, with alcohol a con-\ntributing factor, and a third is a living alcoholic\u2014if you call that living.\n\nWhile susceptibility varies, addiction can happen to any of us through a subtle process where the bonds of degradation are too\nlight to be felt until they are too strong to be broken. And yet, I have yet to meet anyone, in over six decades of life, whose life was\n\nworsened by fear and avoidance of such a deceptive pathway to destruction.\n\f"}, "003843.png": {"text": "Envy, of course, joins chemicals in winning some sort of quantity prize for causing misery. It was wreaking havoc long before it\ngot bad press in the laws of Moses. If you wish to retain the contribution of envy to misery, I recommend that you never read any of\nthe biographies of that good Christian Samuel Johnson, because his life demonstrates in an enticing way the possibility and advan-\ntage of transcending envy.\n\nResentment has always worked for me exactly as it worked for Carson. I cannot recommend it highly enough to you if you\ndesire misery. Johnson spoke well when he said that life is hard enough to swallow without squeezing in the bitter rind of resent-\nment.\n\nFor those of you who want misery, I also recommend refraining from the practice of the Disraeli compromise, designed for\npeople who find it impossible to quit resentment cold turkey. [Benjamin] Disraeli, as he rose to become one of the greatest prime\nministers, learned to give up vengeance as a motivation for action, but he did retain some outlet for resentment by putting the\nnames of people who wronged him on pieces of paper in a drawer. Then, from time to time, he reviewed these names and took\npleasure in noting the way the world had taken his enemies down without his assistance.\n\nWell, so much for Carson\u2019s three prescriptions. Here are four more prescriptions from Munger:\n\nFirst, be unreliable. Do not faithfully do what you have engaged to do. If you will only master this one habit, you will more than\ncounterbalance the combined effect of all your virtues, howsoever great. If you like being distrusted and excluded from the best\nhuman contribution and company, this prescription is for you. Master this one habit, and you will always play the role of the hare\nin the fable, except that instead of being outrun by one fine turtle, you will be outrun by hordes and hordes of mediocre turtles,\nand even some mediocre turtles on crutches.\n\nI must warn you that if you don\u2019t follow my first prescription, it may be hard to end up miserable even if you start disadvan-\ntaged. I had a roommate in college who was and is severely dyslexic. But he is perhaps the most reliable man I have ever known. He\nhas had a wonderful life so far: an outstanding wife and children, chief executive of a multibillion-dollar corporation. If you want\nto avoid a conventional, main-culture, establishment result of this kind, you simply can\u2019t count on your other handicaps to hold\n\nyou back if you persist in being reliable.\n\f"}, "003844.png": {"text": "Icannot here pass by a reference to a life described as \u201cwonderful so far\u201d without reinforcing the \u201cso far\u201d aspects of the human\ncondition by repeating the remark of Croesus,\u201d once the richest king in the world. Later, in ignominious captivity, as he prepared to\nbe burned alive, he said, \u201cWell now do I remember the words of the historian Solon: \u2018No man\u2019s life should be accounted a happy one\nuntil it is over.\u201d\n\nMy second prescription for misery is to learn everything you possibly can from your own experience, minimizing what you\nlearn vicariously from the good and bad experiences of others, living and dead. This prescription is a sure-shot producer of misery\nand second-rate achievement.\n\nYou can see the results of not learning from others\u2019 mistakes by simply looking about you. How little originality there is in the\ncommon disasters of mankind: drunk driving deaths, reckless driving maimings, incurable venereal diseases, conversion of bright\ncollege students into brainwashed zombies as members of destructive cults, business failures through repetition of obvious mis-\ntakes made by predecessors, various forms of crowd folly, and so on. Irecommend as a memory clue to finding the way to real trou-\nble from heedless, unoriginal error the modern saying \u201cIf at first you don\u2019t succeed, well, so much for hang gliding.\u201d\n\nThe other aspect of avoiding vicarious wisdom is the rule of not learning from the best work done before yours. The prescrip-\ntion is to become as non-educated as you reasonably can.\n\nPerhaps you will better see the type of non-miserable result you can thus avoid if I render a short historical account. There once\nwas aman who assiduously mastered the work of his best predecessors, despite a poor start and very tough time in analytical ge-\nometry. Eventually, his own work attracted wide attention, and he said of his work, \u201cIf I have seen a little farther than other men,\nit is because I stood on the shoulders of giants.\u201d The bones of that man lie buried now, in Westminster Abbey, under an unusual in-\nscription: \u201cHere lie the remains of all that was mortal in Sir Isaac Newton.\u201d=\n\nMy third prescription to you for misery is to go down and stay down when you get your first, second, or third severe reverse in\nthe battle of life. Because there is so much adversity out there, even for the lucky and wise, this will guarantee that, in due course,\nyou will be permanently mired in misery. Ignore at all cost the lesson contained in the accurate epitaph written for himself by\n\nEpictetus:~ \u201cHere lies Epictetus, a slave, maimed in body, the ultimate in poverty, and favored by the gods.\u201d\n\f"}, "003845.png": {"text": "My final prescription to you for a life of fuzzy thinking and infelicity is to ignore a story they told me when I was very young\nabout a rustic who said, \u201cI wish I knew where I was going to die, and then I'd never go there.\u201d Most people smile, as you did, at the\nrustic\u2019s ignorance and ignore his basic wisdom. If my experience is any guide, the rustic\u2019s approach is to be avoided at all cost by\nsomeone bent on misery. To help fail, you should discount as mere quirk, with no useful message, the method of the rustic, which\nis the same one used in Carson\u2019s speech.\n\nWhat Carson did was to approach the study of how to create X by turning the question backward\u2014that is, by studying how to\ncreate non-X. The great algebraist Jacobi had exactly the same approach as Carson and was known for his constant repetition of\none phrase: \u201cInvert, always invert.\u201d It is in the nature of things, as Jacobi knew, that many hard problems are best solved only when\nthey are addressed backward. For instance, when almost everyone else was trying to revise the electromagnetic laws of [James\nClerk] Maxwell\u2019 to be consistent with the motion laws of Newton, Einstein\u201d discovered special relativity as he made a 180-degree\nturn and revised Newton's laws to fit Maxwell's.\n\nIt is my opinion, as a certified biography nut, that Charles Robert Darwin\u201d would have ranked near the middle of the Harvard\nSchool graduating class of 1986. Yet he is now famous in the history of science. This is precisely the type of example you should\nlearn nothing from if bent on minimizing your results from your own endowment.\n\nDarwin\u2019s result was due in large measure to his working method, which violated all my rules for misery and particularly\nemphasized a backward twist in that he always gave priority attention to evidence tending to disconfirm whatever cherished and\nhard-won theory he already had. In contrast, most people early achieve and later intensify a tendency to process new and discon-\nfirming information so that any original conclusion remains intact. They become people of whom Philip Wylie observed, \u201cYou\ncouldn\u2019t squeeze a dime between what they already know and what they will never learn.\u201d\n\nThe life of Darwin demonstrates how a turtle may outrun a hare, aided by extreme objectivity, which helps the objective person\n\nend up like the only player without a blindfold in a game of pin the tail on the donkey.\n\f"}, "003846.png": {"text": "If you minimize objectivity, you ignore not only a lesson from Darwin but also one from Einstein. Einstein said that his success-\nful theories came from \u201ccuriosity, concentration, perseverance, and self-criticism.\u201d And by self-criticism, he meant the testing and\ndestruction of his own well-loved ideas.\n\nFinally, minimizing objectivity will help you lessen the compromises and burden of owning worldly goods, because objectivity\ndoes not work only for great physicists and biologists.

Then, as signs of shock come to surrounding faces, I explain that McDonald's,\nproviding first jobs to millions of teenagers, many troubled, over the years, has successfully taught most of them the one lesson\nthey most need: to show up reliably for responsible work. Then I usually go on to say that if the elite campuses were as successful\n\nas McDonald's in teaching sensibly, we would have a better world.\n\f"}, "003847.png": {"text": "CHAPTER 4; TALK TWO\n\nstripe.press/pca-6\n\nA Lesson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom as It\nRelates to Investment Management and Business\n\nAPRIL 14, 1994\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA\nMARSHALL SCHOOL OF BUSINESS\n\n \n\nWell known because it was published in Outstanding Investor Digest (May 5, 1995), this talk was given in 1994 to\nProfessor Guilford Babcock\u2019s business class at the University of Southern California.

That enables me to start talking about worldly wisdom, a much broader topic that interests me because I think\nall too little of it is delivered by modern educational systems, at least in an effective way. And, therefore, the talk is sort of along the\nlines that some behaviorist psychologists call \u201cgrandma\u2019s rule,\u201d after the wisdom of grandma when she said that you have to eat\nthe carrots before you get the dessert.\n\nThe carrot part of this talk is about the general subject of worldly wisdom, which is a pretty good way to start. After all, the\ntheory of modern education is that you need a general education before you specialize. And I think, to some extent, before you're\ngoing to bea great stock picker, you need some general education. So, emphasizing what I sometimes waggishly call remedial\nworldly wisdom, I\u2019m going to start by waltzing you through a few basic notions.\n\nWhat is elementary, worldly wisdom? Well, the first rule is that you can\u2019t really know anything if you just remember isolated\nfacts and try and bang \u2019em back. If the facts don\u2019t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don\u2019t have them in a usable form.\nYou've got to have models in your head. And you've got to array your experience\u2014both vicarious and direct\u2014on this latticework\nof models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school\nand fail in life. You\u2019ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.\n\nWhat are the models? Well, the first rule is that you\u2019ve got to have multiple models\u2014because if you have just one or two that\nyou're using, the nature of human psychology is such that you'll torture reality so that it fits your models, or at least you'll think\n\nit does. You become the equivalent of a chiropractor, who, of course, is the great boob in medicine. It\u2019s like the old saying, \u201cTo the\n\f"}, "003849.png": {"text": "man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.\u201d And, of course, that\u2019s the way the chiropractor goes about practicing\nmedicine. But that\u2019s a perfectly disastrous way to think and a perfectly disastrous way to operate in the world. So you've got to have\nmultiple models.\n\nAnd the models have to come from multiple disciplines\u2014because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little\nacademic department. That\u2019s why poetry professors, by and large, are so unwise in a worldly sense. They don\u2019t have enough mod-\nels in their heads. So you've got to have models across a fair array of disciplines.\n\nYou may say, \u201cMy god, this is already getting way too tough.\u201d But fortunately, it isn\u2019t that tough\u2014because 80 or 90 important\nmodels will carry about 90 percent of the freight in making you a worldly-wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really\ncarry very heavy freight.\n\nSo let\u2019s briefly review what kinds of models and techniques constitute this basic knowledge that everybody has to have before\nthey proceed to being really good at a narrow art like stock picking.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s mathematics. Obviously, you've got to be able to handle numbers and quantities\u2014basic arithmetic. And the great\nuseful model, after compound interest, is the elementary math of permutations and combinations. That was taught in my day in\nthe sophomore year in high school. I suppose by now, in great private schools, it\u2019s probably down to the eighth grade or so. It\u2019s very\nsimple algebra. And it was all worked out in the course of about one year in correspondence between [Blaise] Pascal and [Pierre de]\nFermat.~ They worked it out casually in a series of letters.\n\nIt\u2019s not that hard to learn. What is hard is to get so you use it routinely almost every day of your life. The Fermat/Pascal system\nis dramatically consonant with the way the world works. And it\u2019s a fundamental truth. So you simply have to have the technique.\n\nMany educational institutions\u2014although not nearly enough\u2014have realized this. At Harvard Business School, the great quanti-\ntative thing that bonds the first year class together is what they call decision tree theory. All they do is take high school algebra and\napply it to real life problems. And the students love it. They\u2019re amazed to find that high school algebra works in life.\n\nBy and large, as it works out, people can\u2019t naturally and automatically do this. If you understand elementary psychology, the\n\nreason they can\u2019t is really quite simple: The basic neural network of the brain is there through broad genetic and cultural evolution.\n\f"}, "003850.png": {"text": "And it\u2019s not Fermat/Pascal. It uses a very crude, shortcut type of approximation. It\u2019s got elements of Fermat/Pascal in it. However,\nit\u2019s not good. So you have to learn in a very usable way this very elementary math and use it routinely in life\u2014just the way that if\nyou want to become a golfer, you can\u2019t use the natural swing that broad evolution gave you. You have to learn to have a certain grip\nand swing in a different way to realize your full potential as a golfer.\n\nIf you don't get this elementary, but mildly unnatural, mathematics of elementary probability into your repertoire, then you\ngo through a long life like a one legged man in an ass kicking contest. You're giving a huge advantage to everybody else. One of the\nadvantages of a fellow like Buffett, whom I\u2019ve worked with all these years, is that he automatically thinks in terms of decision trees\nand the elementary math of permutations and combinations.\n\nObviously, you have to know accounting. It\u2019s the language of practical business life. It was a very useful thing to deliver to civ-\nilization. I\u2019ve heard it came to civilization through Venice, which, of course, was once the great commercial power in the Mediter-\nranean. However, double entry bookkeeping was a hell of an invention. And it\u2019s not that hard to understand. But you have to know\nenough about it to understand its limitations\u2014because although accounting is the starting place, it\u2019s only a crude approximation.\nAnd it\u2019s not very hard to understand its limitations. For example, everyone can see that you have to more or less just guess at the\nuseful life of a jet airplane or anything like that. Just because you express the depreciation rate in neat numbers doesn\u2019t make it\nanything you really know.\n\nIn terms of the limitations of accounting, one of my favorite stories involves a very great businessman named Carl Braun who\ncreated the C. F. Braun Engineering Company. It designed and built oil refineries, which is very hard to do. And Braun would get\nthem to come in on time and not blow up and have efficiencies and so forth. This is a major art.\n\nBraun, being the thorough Teutonic type that he was, had a number of quirks. One of them was that he took a look at standard\naccounting and the way it was applied to building oil refineries and he said, \u201cThis is asinine.\u201d So he threw all of his accountants\nout, and he took his engineers and said, \u201cNow we'll devise our own system of accounting to handle this process.\u201d And in due time,\naccounting adopted a lot of Carl Braun\u2019s notions. So he was a formidably willful and talented man who demonstrated both the im-\n\nportance of accounting and the importance of knowing its limitations.\n\f"}, "003851.png": {"text": "He had another rule, from psychology\u2014which, if you're interested in wisdom, ought to be part of your repertoire, like the\nelementary mathematics of permutations and combinations. His rule for all the Braun Company\u2019s communications was called the\nfive Ws: You had to tell who was going to do what, where, when, and why. And if you wrote a letter or directive in the Braun Company\ntelling somebody to do something and you didn\u2019t tell him why, you could get fired. In fact, you would get fired if you did it twice.\n\nYou might ask, why is that so important? Well, again, that\u2019s a rule of psychology. Just as you think better if you array knowledge\nona bunch of models that are basically answers to the question \u201cWhy, why, why?,\u201d if you always tell people why, they\u2019ll under-\nstand it better, they\u2019ll consider it more important, and they'll be more likely to comply. Even if they don\u2019t understand your reason,\nthey\u2019ll be more likely to comply. So there\u2019s an iron rule that just as you want to start getting worldly wisdom by asking \u201cWhy, why,\nwhy?,\u201d in communicating with other people about everything, you want to include why, why, why. Even if it\u2019s obvious, it\u2019s wise to\nstick in the why.\n\nWhich models are the most reliable? Well, obviously, the models that come from hard science and engineering are the most\nreliable models on this earth. And engineering quality control\u2014at least the guts of it that matters to you and me and people who\nare not professional engineers\u2014is very much based on the elementary mathematics of Fermat and Pascal: It costs so much, and\nyou get so much less likelihood of it breaking if you spend this much. It\u2019s all elementary high school mathematics. And an elabora-\ntion of that is what [W. Edwards] Deming brought to Japan for all of that quality control stuff.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary for most people to be terribly facile in statistics. For example, I\u2019m not sure that I can even pronounce\nthe Gaussian distribution, although I know what it looks like and I know that events and huge aspects of reality end up distributed\nthat way. So I can do a rough calculation. But if you ask me to work out something involving a Gaussian distribution to 10 decimal\npoints, I can\u2019t sit down and do the math. I\u2019m like a poker player who\u2019s learned to play pretty well without mastering Pascal. And, by\nthe way, that works well enough. But you have to understand that bell shaped curve at least roughly as well as I do.\n\nAnd, of course, the engineering idea of a backup system is a very powerful idea. The engineering idea of breakpoints, that\u2019s a\n\nvery powerful model too. The notion of a critical mass\u2014that comes out of physics\u2014is a very powerful model.\n\f"}, "003852.png": {"text": "All of these things have great utility in looking at ordinary reality. And all of this cost benefit analysis\u2014hell, that\u2019s all elemen-\ntary high school algebra. It\u2019s just been dolled up a little bit with fancy lingo. And you can demonstrate that point quite simply:\nThere\u2019s not a person in this room viewing the work of a very ordinary professional magician who doesn\u2019t see a lot of things hap-\npening that aren\u2019t happening and not see a lot of things happening that are happening.\n\nI suppose the next most reliable models are from biology and physiology because, after all, all of us are programmed by our ge-\nnetic makeup to be much the same.\n\nThen, when you get into psychology, of course, it gets very much more complicated. But it\u2019s an ungodly important subject if\nyou're going to have any worldly wisdom. And the reason why is that the perceptual apparatus of man has shortcuts in it. The\nbrain cannot have unlimited circuitry. So someone who knows how to take advantage of those shortcuts and cause the brain to\nmiscalculate in certain ways can cause you to see things that aren\u2019t there.\n\nNow you get into the cognitive function as distinguished from the perceptual function. And there, you are equally\u2014more than\nequally, in fact\u2014likely to be misled. Again, your brain has a shortage of circuitry and so forth, and it\u2019s taking all kinds of little\nautomatic shortcuts. So when circumstances combine in certain ways\u2014or, more commonly, when your fellow man starts acting\nlike the magician and manipulates you on purpose by causing you cognitive dysfunction\u2014you\u2019re a patsy. And so, just as aman\nworking with a tool has to know its limitations, a man working with his cognitive apparatus has to know its limitations. And this\nknowledge, by the way, can be used to control and motivate other people.\n\nSo the most useful and practical part of psychology\u2014which I personally think can be taught to any intelligent person in a week\n\u2014is ungodly important. And nobody taught it to me, by the way. I had to learn it later in life, one piece at a time. And it was fairly\nlaborious. It\u2019s so elementary, though, that when it was all over, I just felt like a total horse\u2019s ass. And yeah, I\u2019d been educated at Cal-\ntech and the Harvard Law School and so forth. So very eminent places miseducated people like you and me.\n\nThe elementary part of psychology\u2014the psychology of misjudgment, as I call it\u2014is a terribly important thing to learn. There\n\nare about 20 little principles. And they interact, so it gets slightly complicated. But the guts of it is unbelievably important. Terribly\n\f"}, "003853.png": {"text": "smart people make totally bonkers mistakes by failing to pay heed to it. In fact, I\u2019ve done it several times during the last two or\nthree years in a very important way. You never get totally over making silly mistakes.\n\nThere\u2019s another saying that comes from Pascal that I\u2019ve always considered one of the really accurate observations in the history\nof thought. Pascal said, \u201cThe mind of man at one and the same time is both the glory and the shame of the universe.\u201d And that\u2019s\nexactly right. It has this enormous power. However, it also has these standard misfunctions that often cause it to reach wrong\nconclusions. It also makes man extraordinarily subject to manipulation by others. For example, roughly half of the army of Adolf\nHitler was composed of believing Catholics. Given enough clever psychological manipulation, what human beings will do is quite\ninteresting.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve gotten so that I now use a kind of two track analysis. First, what are the factors that really govern the interests\ninvolved, rationally considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain, at a subconscious level, is au-\ntomatically doing these things\u2014which, by and large, are useful but which often misfunction? One approach is rationality, the way\nyou'd work out a bridge problem: by evaluating the real interests, the real probabilities, and so forth. And the other is to evaluate\nthe psychological factors that cause subconscious conclusions, many of which are wrong.\n\nNow we come to another, somewhat less reliable form of human wisdom: microeconomics. Here I find it quite useful to think of\na free-market economy\u2014or a partly free-market economy\u2014as sort of the equivalent of an ecosystem.\n\nThis is a very unfashionable way of thinking because early in the days after Darwin came along, people like the robber barons\nassumed that the doctrine of the survival of the fittest authenticated them as deserving power\u2014you know, \u201cI\u2019m the richest.\nTherefore, I\u2019m the best. God\u2019s in his heaven,\u201d etc. And that reaction of the robber barons was so irritating to people that it made it\nunfashionable to think of an economy as an ecosystem. But the truth is that it is a lot like an ecosystem. And you get many of the\nsame results. Just as in an ecosystem, people who narrowly specialize can get terribly good at occupying some little niche. Just as\nanimals flourish in niches, people who specialize in the business world\u2014and get very good because they specialize\u2014frequently\n\nfind good economics that they wouldn't get any other way.\n\f"}, "003854.png": {"text": "And once we get into microeconomics, we get into the concept of advantages of scale. Now we're getting closer to investment\nanalysis, because in terms of which businesses succeed and which businesses fail, advantages of scale are ungodly important.\n\nFor example, one great advantage of scale taught in all of the business schools of the world is cost reductions along the so called\nexperience curve. Just doing something complicated in more and more volume enables human beings, who are trying to improve\nand are motivated by the incentives of capitalism, to do it more and more efficiently. The very nature of things is that if you get a\nwhole lot of volume through your operation, you get better at processing that volume. That\u2019s an enormous advantage. And it has a\nlot to do with which businesses succeed and fail.\n\nLet\u2019s go through a list\u2014albeit an incomplete one\u2014of possible advantages of scale. Some come from simple geometry. If you're\nbuilding a great circular tank, obviously, as you build it bigger, the amount of steel you use in the surface goes up with the square\nand the cubic volume goes up with the cube. So as you increase the dimensions, you can hold a lot more volume per unit area of\nsteel.\n\nThere are all kinds of things like that where the simple geometry\u2014the simple reality\u2014gives you an advantage of scale. For\nexample, you can get advantages of scale from TV advertising. When TV advertising first arrived\u2014when talking color pictures first\ncame into our living rooms\u2014it was an unbelievably powerful thing. And in the early days, we had three networks that had what-\never it was, say 90 percent of the audience.\n\nWell, if you were Procter & Gamble, you could afford to use this new method of advertising. You could afford the very expensive\ncost of network television because you were selling so damn many cans and bottles. Some little guy couldn't. And there was no\nway of buying it in part. Therefore, he couldn't use it. In effect, if you didn\u2019t have a big volume, you couldn\u2019t use network TV ad-\nvertising, which was the most effective technique. So when TV came in, the branded companies that were already big got a huge\ntailwind. Indeed, they prospered and prospered and prospered until some of them got fat and foolish, which happens with pros-\nperity, at least to some people.\n\nAnd your advantage of scale can be an informational advantage. If I go to some remote place, I may see Wrigley chewing gum\n\nalongside Glotz\u2019s chewing gum. Well, I know that Wrigley is a satisfactory product whereas I don\u2019t know anything about Glotz\u2019s.\n\f"}, "003855.png": {"text": "So if one is 40\u00a2 and the other is 30\u00a2, am I going to take something I don\u2019t know and put it in my mouth\u2014which is a pretty personal\nplace, after all\u2014for a lousy dime? So, in effect, Wrigley, simply by being so well known, has advantages of scale\u2014what you might\ncall an informational advantage.\n\nAnother advantage of scale comes from psychology. Psychologists use the term social proof. We are all influenced\u2014subcon-\nsciously and, to some extent, consciously\u2014by what we see others do and approve. Therefore, if everybody\u2019s buying something, we\nthink it\u2019s better. We don\u2019t like to be the one guy who's out of step. Again, some of this is at a subconscious level and some of it isn\u2019t.\nSometimes, we consciously and rationally think, \u201cGee, I don\u2019t know much about this. They know more than I do. Therefore, why\nshouldn't I follow them?\u201d\n\nThe social proof phenomenon, which comes right out of psychology, gives huge advantages to scale\u2014for example, with very\nwide distribution, which of course is hard to get. One advantage of Coca Cola is that it\u2019s available almost everywhere in the world.\n\nWell, suppose you have a little soft drink. Exactly how do you make it available all over the earth? The worldwide distribution\nsetup, which is slowly won by a big enterprise, gets to be a huge advantage. And if you think about it, once you get enough advan-\ntages of that type, it can become very hard for anybody to dislodge you.\n\nThere\u2019s another kind of advantage to scale. In some businesses, the very nature of things is to sort of cascade toward the over-\nwhelming dominance of one firm. The most obvious one is daily newspapers. There\u2019s practically no city left in the United States,\naside from a few very big ones, where there\u2019s more than one daily newspaper. And, again, that\u2019s a scale thing. Once I get most of\nthe circulation, I get most of the advertising. And once I get most of the advertising and circulation, why would anyone want the\nthinner paper with less information in it? So it tends to cascade to a winner-take all situation. And that\u2019s a separate form of the ad-\nvantages of-scale phenomenon.\n\nSimilarly, all these huge advantages of scale allow greater specialization within the firm. Therefore, each person can be better at\nwhat he does. And these advantages of scale are so great, for example, that when Jack Welch~ came into General Electric, he just\nsaid, \u201cTo hell with it. We're either going to be number one or number two in every field we're in or we're going to be out. I don't care\n\nhow many people I have to fire and what I have to sell. We\u2019re going to be number one or number two or out.\u201d\n\f"}, "003856.png": {"text": "That was a very tough minded thing to do, but I think it was a very correct decision if you're thinking about maximizing share-\nholder wealth. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing to do for a civilization either, because I think that General Electric is stronger for\nhaving Jack Welch there.\n\nAnd there are also disadvantages of scale. For example, we\u2014by which I mean Berkshire Hathaway\u2014are the largest shareholder\nin Capital Cities/ABC. And we had trade publications there that got murdered, where our competitors beat us. And the way they\nbeat us was by going to a narrower specialization. We'd have a travel magazine for business travel, so somebody would create one\nthat was addressed solely at corporate travel departments. Like an ecosystem, you're getting a narrower and narrower specializa-\ntion.\n\nWell, they got much more efficient. They could tell more to the guys who ran corporate travel departments. Plus, they didn\u2019t\nhave to waste the ink and paper mailing out stuff that corporate travel departments weren't interested in reading. It was a more\nefficient system. And they beat our brains out as we relied on our broader magazine.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to The Saturday Evening Post and all those things. They\u2019re gone. What we have now is Motocross, which\nis read by a bunch of nuts who like to participate in tournaments where they turn somersaults on their motorcycles. But they care\nabout it. For them, it\u2019s the principal purpose of life. A magazine called Motocross is a total necessity to those people. And its profit\nmargins would make you salivate. Just think of how narrowcast that kind of publishing is. So occasionally, scaling down and in-\ntensifying gives you the big advantage. Bigger is not always better.\n\nThe great defect of scale, of course, which makes the game interesting, so that the big people don\u2019t always win, is that as you get\nbig, you get the bureaucracy. And with the bureaucracy comes the territoriality\u2014which is again grounded in human nature. And\nthe incentives are perverse. For example, if you worked for AT & T in my day, it was a great bureaucracy. Who in the hell was really\nthinking about the shareholder or anything else? And in a bureaucracy, you think the work is done when it goes out of your in bas-\nket into somebody else\u2019s in basket. But, of course, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s not done until AT & T delivers what it\u2019s supposed to deliver. So you get\n\nbig, fat, dumb, unmotivated bureaucracies.\n\f"}, "003857.png": {"text": "They also tend to become somewhat corrupt. In other words, if I\u2019ve got a department and you've got a department and we kind\nof share power running this thing, there\u2019s sort of an unwritten rule: \u201cIf you won't bother me, I won\u2019t bother you, and we\u2019re both\nhappy.\u201d So you get layers of management and associated costs that nobody needs. Then, while people are justifying all these layers,\nit takes forever to get anything done. They\u2019re too slow to make decisions, and nimbler people run circles around them.\n\nThe constant curse of scale is that it leads to big, dumb bureaucracy\u2014which, of course, reaches its highest and worst form in\ngovernment, where the incentives are really awful. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t need governments, because we do. But it\u2019s a terrible\nproblem to get big bureaucracies to behave. So people go to stratagems. They create little decentralized units and fancy motivation\nand training programs. For example, for a big company, General Electric has fought bureaucracy with amazing skill. But that\u2019s\nbecause they have a combination of a genius and a fanatic running it. And they put him in young enough, so he gets a long run. Of\ncourse, that\u2019s Jack Welch.\n\nBut bureaucracy is terrible. And as things get very powerful and very big, you can get some really dysfunctional behavior. Look\nat Westinghouse. They blew billions of dollars on a bunch of dumb loans to real estate developers. They put in some guy who'd\ncome up by some career path\u2014I don\u2019t know exactly what it was, but it could have been refrigerators or something\u2014and all of a\nsudden, he\u2019s loaning money to real estate developers building hotels. It\u2019s a very unequal contest. And, in due time, they lost all\nthose billions of dollars.\n\nCBS provides an interesting example of another rule of psychology, namely Pavlovian association. If people tell you what you\nreally don\u2019t want to hear, what\u2019s unpleasant, there\u2019s an almost automatic reaction of antipathy. You have to train yourself out of it.\nIt isn\u2019t foredestined that you have to be this way. But you will tend to be this way if you don\u2019t think about it.\n\nTelevision was dominated by one network, CBS, in its early days. And [William S.] Paley was a god. But he didn\u2019t like to hear what\nhe didn\u2019t like to hear, and people soon learned that. So they told Paley only what he liked to hear. Therefore, he was soon living ina\nlittle cocoon of unreality and everything else was corrupt\u2014although it was a great business. So the idiocy that crept into the sys-\n\ntem was carried along by this huge tide. It was a Mad Hatter\u2019s tea party the last 10 years under Bill Paley.\n\f"}, "003858.png": {"text": "And that is not the only example, by any means. You can get severe misfunction in the high ranks of business. And, of course, if\nyou're investing, it can make a hell of a lot of difference. If you take all the acquisitions that CBS made under Paley after the acqui-\nsition of the network itself, with all his dumb advisers\u2014his investment bankers, management consultants, and so forth, who were\ngetting paid very handsomely\u2014it was absolutely terrible.\n\nSo life is an everlasting battle between those two forces: to get these advantages of scale on one side and a tendency to get a lot\nlike the US Department of Agriculture on the other side, where they just sit around and so forth. I don\u2019t know exactly what they do.\nHowever, I do know that they do very little useful work.\n\nOn the subject of the advantages of economies of scale, I find chain stores quite interesting. Just think about it. The concept of a\nchain store was a fascinating invention: You get this huge purchasing power, which means that you have lower merchandise costs.\nYou get a whole bunch of little laboratories out there in which you can conduct experiments. And you get specialization. If one\nlittle guy is trying to buy across 27 different merchandise categories influenced by traveling salesmen, he\u2019s going to make a lot of\ndumb decisions. But if your buying is done in headquarters for a huge bunch of stores, you can get very bright people who know a\nlot about refrigerators and so forth to do the buying.\n\nThe reverse is demonstrated by the little store where one guy is doing all the buying. It\u2019s like the old story about the little store\nwith salt all over its walls. A stranger comes in and says to the store owner, \u201cYou must sell a lot of salt.\u201d And he replies, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\nBut you should see the guy who sells me salt.\u201d\n\nSo there are huge purchasing advantages. And then there are the slick systems of forcing everyone to do what works. So a chain\nstore can be a fantastic enterprise.\n\nIt\u2019s quite interesting to think about Walmart starting from a single store in Arkansas against Sears, Roebuck, with its name,\nreputation, and all of its billions. How does a guy in Bentonville, Arkansas, with no money, blow right by Sears, Roebuck? And he\ndoes it in his own lifetime\u2014in fact, during his own late lifetime because he was already pretty old by the time he started out with\n\none little store.\n\f"}, "003859.png": {"text": "He played the chain store game harder and better than anyone else. [Sam] Walton invented practically nothing. But he copied\neverything anybody else ever did that was smart\u2014and he did it with more fanaticism and better employee manipulation. So he\njust blew right by them all.\n\nHe also had a very interesting competitive strategy in the early days. He was like a prizefighter who wanted a great record so\nhe could be in the finals and make a big TV hit. So what did he do? He went out and fought 42 palookas. Right? And the result was\nknockout, knockout, knockout\u201442 times. Walton, being as shrewd as he was, basically broke other small town merchants in the\nearly days. With his more efficient system, he might not have been able to tackle some titan head on at the time. But with his better\nsystem, he could sure as hell destroy those small town merchants. And he went around doing it time after time after time. Then, as\nhe got bigger, he started destroying the big boys. Well, that was a very, very shrewd strategy.\n\nYou can say, \u201cIs this a nice way to behave?\u201d Well, capitalism is a pretty brutal place. But I personally think that the world is better\nfor having Walmart. I mean, you can idealize small town life, but I\u2019ve spent a fair amount of time in small towns. And let me tell\nyou\u2014you shouldn't get too idealistic about all those businesses he destroyed. Plus, a lot of people who work at Walmart are very\nhigh grade, bouncy people who are raising nice children. I have no feeling that an inferior culture destroyed a superior culture. I\nthink that is nothing more than nostalgia and delusion. But at any rate, it\u2019s an interesting model of how the scale of things and fa-\nnaticism combine to be very powerful.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also an interesting model on the other side\u2014how, with all its great advantages, the disadvantages of bureaucracy did\nsuch terrible damage to Sears, Roebuck. Sears had layers and layers of people it didn\u2019t need. It was very bureaucratic. It was slow\nto think. And there was an established way of thinking. If you poked your head up with a new thought, the system kind of turned\nagainst you. It was everything in the way of a dysfunctional big bureaucracy that you would expect.\n\nIn all fairness, there was also much that was good about it. But it just wasn\u2019t as lean and mean and shrewd and effective as Sam\nWalton. And, in due time, all Sears\u2019 advantages of scale were not enough to prevent it from losing heavily to Walmart and other,\n\nsimilar retailers.\n\f"}, "003860.png": {"text": "Here\u2019s a model that we\u2019ve had trouble with. Maybe you'll be able to figure it out better. Many markets get down to two or three\nbig competitors, or five or six. And in some of those markets, nobody makes any money to speak of. But in others, everybody does\nvery well. Over the years, we've tried to figure out why the competition in some markets gets sort of rational from the investor's\npoint of view so that the shareholders do well, while in other markets there\u2019s destructive competition that destroys shareholder\nwealth.\n\nIf it\u2019s a pure commodity like airline seats, you can understand why no one makes any money. As we sit here, just think of what\nairlines have given to the world: safe travel, greater experience, time with your loved ones, you name it. Yet the net amount of\nmoney that\u2019s been made by the shareholders of airlines since Kitty Hawk is now a negative figure\u2014a substantial negative figure.\nCompetition was so intense that, once it was unleashed by deregulation, it ravaged shareholder wealth in the airline business.\n\nYet in other fields\u2014like cereals, for example\u2014almost all the big boys make out. If you\u2019re some kind of a medium grade cereal\nmaker, you might make 15 percent on your capital. And if you're really good, you might make 40 percent. But why are cereals so\nprofitable, despite the fact that it looks to me like they\u2019re competing like crazy with promotions, coupons, and everything else? I\ndon\u2019t fully understand it.\n\nObviously, there\u2019s a brand identity factor in cereals that doesn\u2019t exist in airlines. That must be the main factor that accounts\nfor it. And maybe the cereal makers, by and large, have learned to be less crazy about fighting for market share\u2014because if you get\neven one person who\u2019s hell bent on gaining market share ... For example, if I were Kellogg and I decided that I had to have 60 per-\ncent of the market, I think I could take most of the profit out of cereals. I\u2019d ruin Kellogg in the process. But I think I could do it.\n\nIn some businesses, the participants behave like a demented Kellogg. In other businesses, they don\u2019t. Unfortunately, Ido\nnot have a perfect model for predicting how that\u2019s going to happen. For example, if you look around at bottler markets, you'll\nfind many markets where bottlers of Pepsi and Coke both make a lot of money and many others where they destroy most of the\nprofitability of the two franchises. That must get down to the peculiarities of individual adjustment to market capitalism. I think\n\nyou'd have to know the people involved to fully understand what was happening.\n\f"}, "003861.png": {"text": "In microeconomics, of course, you've got the concept of patents, trademarks, exclusive franchises, and so forth. Patents are\nquite interesting. When I was young, I think more money went into patents than came out. Judges tended to throw them out based\non arguments about what was really invented and what relied on prior art. That isn\u2019t altogether clear. But they changed that. They\ndidn\u2019t change the laws, they just changed the administration, so that it all goes to one patent court. And that court is now very\nmuch more pro patent. So I think people are now starting to make a lot of money out of owning patents.\n\nTrademarks, of course, have always made people a lot of money. A trademark system is a wonderful thing for a big operation if\nit\u2019s well known.\n\nThe exclusive franchise can also be wonderful. If there were only three television channels awarded in a big city and you owned\none of them, there were only so many hours a day that you could be on. So you had a natural position in an oligopoly in the pre\ncable days. And if you get the franchise for the only food stand in an airport, you have a captive clientele, and you have a small mo-\nnopoly of a sort.\n\nThe great lesson in microeconomics is to discriminate between when technology is going to help you and when it\u2019s going to kill\nyou. And most people do not get this straight in their heads. But a fellow like Buffett does. For example, when we were in the textile\nbusiness, which is a terrible commodity business, we were making low end textiles, which are a real commodity product. And one\nday, the people came to Warren and said, \u201cThey\u2019ve invented a new loom that we think will do twice as much work as our old ones.\u201d\nAnd Warren said, \u201cGee, I hope this doesn\u2019t work\u2014because if it does, I\u2019m going to close the mill.\u201d And he meant it.\n\nWhat was he thinking? He was thinking, \u201cIt\u2019s a lousy business. We\u2019re earning substandard returns and keeping it open just to\nbe nice to the elderly workers. But we're not going to put huge amounts of new capital into a lousy business.\u201d And he knew that\nthe huge productivity increases that would come from a better machine introduced into the production of a commodity product\nwould all go to the benefit of the buyers of the textiles. Nothing was going to stick to our ribs as owners.\n\nThat\u2019s such an obvious concept\u2014that there are all kinds of wonderful new inventions that give you nothing as owners except\nthe opportunity to spend a lot more money in a business that\u2019s still going to be lousy. The money still won\u2019t come to you. All of the\n\nadvantages from great improvements are going to flow through to the customers.\n\f"}, "003862.png": {"text": "Conversely, if you own the only newspaper in Oshkosh and they were to invent more efficient ways of composing the whole\nnewspaper, then when you got rid of the old technology and got new, fancy computers and so forth, all of the savings would come\nright through to the bottom line.\n\nIn all cases, the people who sell the machinery\u2014and, by and large, even the internal bureaucrats urging you to buy the equip-\nment\u2014show you projections with the amount you'll save at current prices with the new technology. However, they don\u2019t do the\nsecond step of the analysis, which is to determine how much is going to stay home and how much is just going to flow through to\nthe customer. I\u2019ve never seen a single projection incorporating that second step in my life. And I see them all the time. Rather, they\nalways read, \u201cThis capital outlay will save you so much money that it will pay for itself in three years.\u201d\n\nSo you keep buying things that will pay for themselves in three years. And after 20 years of doing it, somehow you've earned a\nreturn of only about 4 percent per annum. That\u2019s the textile business. And it isn\u2019t that the machines weren't better. It\u2019s just that the\nsavings didn\u2019t go to you. The cost reductions came through, all right. But the benefit of the cost reductions didn\u2019t go to the guy who\nbought the equipment. It\u2019s such a simple idea. It\u2019s so basic. And yet it\u2019s so often forgotten.\n\nThen there\u2019s another model from microeconomics that I find very interesting. When technology moves as fast as it does ina\ncivilization like ours, you get a phenomenon that I call competitive destruction. You know, you have the finest buggy whip factory,\nand all of a sudden, in comes this little horseless carriage. And before too many years go by, your buggy whip business is dead. You\neither get into a different business or you\u2019re dead\u2014you're destroyed. It happens again and again and again.\n\nAnd when these new businesses come in, there are huge advantages for the early birds. When you're an early bird, there\u2019s a\nmodel that I call surfing\u2014when a surfer gets up and catches the wave and just stays there, he can goa long, long time. But if he gets\noff the wave, he becomes mired in shallows. But people get long runs when they\u2019re right on the edge of the wave, whether it\u2019s Mi-\ncrosoft or Intel or all kinds of people, including National Cash Register in the early days.\n\nThe cash register was one of the great contributions to civilization. It\u2019s a wonderful story. [John Henry] Patterson was a small\nretail merchant who didn\u2019t make any money. One day, somebody sold him a crude cash register, which he put into his retail opera-\n\ntion. And it instantly changed from losing money to earning a profit because it made it so much harder for the employees to steal.\n\f"}, "003863.png": {"text": "But Patterson, having the kind of mind that he did, didn\u2019t think, \u201cOh, good for my retail business.\u201d He thought, \u201cI\u2019m going into\nthe cash register business.\u201d And, of course, he created National Cash Register. And he surfed. He got the best distribution system,\nthe biggest collection of patents, and the best of everything. He was a fanatic about everything important as the technology\ndeveloped.\n\nThave in my files an early National Cash Register company report in which Patterson described his methods and objectives. And\na well-educated orangutan could see that buying into a partnership with Patterson in those early days, given his notions about the\ncash register business, was a total 100 percent cinch. And, of course, that\u2019s exactly what an investor should be looking for. In along\nlife, you can expect to profit heavily from at least a few of those opportunities if you develop the wisdom and will to seize them. At\nany rate, surfing is a very powerful model.\n\nHowever, Berkshire Hathaway, by and large, does not invest in these people who are surfing on complicated technology. After\nall, we\u2019re cranky and idiosyncratic, as you may have noticed. And Warren and I don\u2019t feel like we have any great advantage in the\nhigh tech sector. In fact, we feel like we're at a big disadvantage in trying to understand the nature of technical developments in\nsoftware, computer chips, or what have you. So we tend to avoid that stuff, based on our personal inadequacies.\n\nAgain, that is a very, very powerful idea. Every person is going to have a circle of competence. And it\u2019s going to be very hard to\n\nenlarge that circle. If I had to make my living as a musician ... I can\u2019t even think of a level low enough to describe where I would be\n\n \n\nsorted out to if music were the measuring standard of the civilization.\n\nSo you have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don't,\nyou're going to lose. And that\u2019s as close to certain as any prediction you can make. You have to figure out where you've got an edge.\nAnd you've got to play within your own circle of competence.\n\nIf you want to be the best tennis player in the world, you may start out trying and soon find out that it\u2019s hopeless\u2014that other\npeople blow right by you. However, if you want to become the best plumbing contractor in Bemidji, that is probably doable by two-\nthirds of you. It takes a will. It takes the intelligence. But after a while, you\u2019d gradually know all about the plumbing business in\n\nBemidji and master the art. That is an attainable objective, given enough discipline. And people who could never win a chess tour-\n\f"}, "003864.png": {"text": "nament or stand in center court in a respectable tennis tournament can rise quite high in life by slowly developing a circle of com-\npetence, which results partly from what they were born with and partly from what they slowly develop through work.\n\nSo some edges can be acquired. And the game of life, to some extent, for most of us, is trying to be something like a good plumb-\ning contractor in Bemidji. Very few of us are chosen to win the world\u2019s chess tournaments. Some of you may find opportunities\nsurfing along in the new high tech fields\u2014the Intels, the Microsofts, and so on. The fact that we don\u2019t think we're very good at it\nand have pretty well stayed out of it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s irrational for you to do it.\n\nWell, so much for the basic microeconomic models, a little bit of psychology, a little bit of mathematics, helping create what I\ncall the general substructure of worldly wisdom. Now, if you want to go on from carrots to dessert, I\u2019ll turn to stock picking, trying\nto draw on this general worldly wisdom as we go.\n\nI don\u2019t want to get into emerging markets, bond arbitrage, and so forth. I\u2019m talking about nothing but plain vanilla stock pick-\ning. That, believe me, is complicated enough. And I\u2019m talking about common stock picking.\n\nThe first question is, what is the nature of the stock market? And that gets you directly to this efficient-market theory that got\nto be the rage\u2014a total rage\u2014long after I graduated from law school. And it\u2019s rather interesting because one of the greatest econo-\nmists of the world is a substantial shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway and has been from the very early days, after Buffett was in\ncontrol. His textbook always taught that the stock market was perfectly efficient and that nobody could beat it. But his own money\nwent into Berkshire and made him wealthy. So, like Pascal in his famous wager, he hedged his bet.\n\nIs the stock market so efficient that people can\u2019t beat it? Well, the efficient-market theory is obviously roughly right, meaning\nthat markets are quite efficient and it\u2019s quite hard for anybody to beat the market by significant margins as a stock picker by just\nbeing intelligent and working in a disciplined way. Indeed, the average result has to be the average result. By definition, everybody\ncan\u2019t beat the market. As I always say, the iron rule of life is that only 20 percent of the people can be in the top fifth. That\u2019s just the\nway it is. So the answer is that it\u2019s partly efficient and partly inefficient.\n\nAnd, by the way, I have a name for people who went to the extreme efficient-market theory, which is \u201cbonkers.\u201d It was an\n\nintellectually consistent theory that enabled them to do pretty mathematics, so I understand its seductiveness to people with large\n\f"}, "003865.png": {"text": "mathematical gifts. It just had a difficulty in that the fundamental assumption did not tie properly to reality. Again, to the man\nwith a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. If you\u2019re good at manipulating higher mathematics in a consistent way, why not\nmake an assumption that enables you to use your tool?\n\nThe model I like\u2014to sort of simplify the notion of what goes on in a market for common stocks\u2014is the pari mutuel system~ at\nthe racetrack. If you stop to think about it, a pari mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets, and the odds change\nbased on what's bet. That\u2019s what happens in the stock market.\n\nAny damn fool can see that a horse carrying a light weight with a wonderful win rate and a good post position, etc., etc., is way\nmore likely to win than a horse with a terrible record and extra weight and so on and so on. But if you look at the damn odds, the\nbad horse pays 100 to 1, whereas the good horse pays 3 to 2. Then it\u2019s not clear which is statistically the best bet using the math-\nematics of Fermat and Pascal. The prices have changed in such a way that it\u2019s very hard to beat the system. And then the track is\ntaking 17 percent off the top. So not only do you have to outwit all the other bettors, but you\u2019ve got to outwit them by such a big\nmargin that, on average, you can afford to take 17 percent of your gross bets off the top and give it to the house before the rest of\nyour money can be put to work.\n\nGiven those mathematics, is it possible to beat the horses using only one\u2019s intelligence? Intelligence should give some edge be-\ncause lots of people who don\u2019t know anything go out and bet lucky numbers and so forth. Therefore, somebody who really thinks\nabout nothing but horse performance and is shrewd and mathematical could have a very considerable edge, in the absence of the\nfrictional cost caused by the house take.\n\nUnfortunately, what a shrewd horseplayer\u2019s edge does in most cases is to reduce his average loss over a season of betting from\nthe 17 percent that he would lose if he got the average result to maybe 10 percent. However, there are actually a few people who\ncan beat the game after paying the full 17 percent.\n\nIused to play poker, when I was young, with a guy who made a substantial living doing nothing but betting on harness races.\nNow, harness racing is a relatively inefficient market. You don\u2019t have the depth of intelligence betting on harness races that you\n\ndo on regular races. What my poker pal would do was to think about harness races as his main profession. And he would bet only\n\f"}, "003866.png": {"text": "occasionally when he saw some mispriced bet available. And by doing that, after paying the full handle to the house\u2014which I pre-\nsume was around 17 percent\u2014he made a substantial living.\n\nYou have to say that\u2019s rare. However, the market was not perfectly efficient. And if it weren't for that big 17 percent handle, lots\nof people would regularly be beating lots of other people at the horse races. It\u2019s efficient, yes. But it\u2019s not perfectly efficient. And\nwith enough shrewdness and fanaticism, some people will get better results than others.\n\nThe stock market is the same way, except that the house handle is so much lower. If you take transaction costs\u2014the spread\nbetween the bid and the ask plus the commissions\u2014and if you don\u2019t trade too actively, you're talking about fairly low transaction\ncosts. So, with enough fanaticism and enough discipline, some of the shrewd people are going to get way better results than aver-\nage in the nature of things.\n\nIt is not a bit easy. And, of course, 50 percent will end up in the bottom half, and 70 percent will end up in the bottom 70\npercent. But some people will have an advantage. And in a fairly low-transaction-cost operation, they will get better than average\nresults in stock picking.\n\nHow do you get to be one of those who is a winner\u2014in a relative sense\u2014instead of a loser? Here again, look at the pari mutuel\nsystem. I had dinner last night by absolute accident with the president of Santa Anita. He says that there are two or three bettors\nwho have a credit arrangement with the track, now that they have off-track betting, who are actually beating the house. The track\nis sending money out net after the full handle\u2014a lot of it to Las Vegas, by the way\u2014to people who are actually winning slightly,\nnet, after paying the full handle. They\u2019re that shrewd about something with as much unpredictability as horse racing.\n\nIt\u2019s not given to human beings to have such talent that they can just know everything about everything all the time. But it is\ngiven to human beings who work hard at it\u2014who look and sift the world for a mispriced bet\u2014that they can occasionally find one.\nAnd the wise ones bet heavily when the world offers them that opportunity. They bet big when they have the odds. And the rest of\nthe time, they don\u2019t. It\u2019s just that simple.\n\nThat is a very simple concept. And to me it\u2019s obviously right, based on experience not only from the pari mutuel system but\n\neverywhere else. And yet, in investment management, practically nobody operates that way. We operate that way\u2014I\u2019'm talking\n\f"}, "003867.png": {"text": "about Buffett and Munger. And we're not alone in the world. But a huge majority of people have some other crazy construct in their\nheads. And instead of waiting for a near cinch and loading up, they apparently ascribe to the theory that if they work a little harder\nor hire more business school students, they\u2019ll come to know everything about everything all the time. To me, that\u2019s totally insane.\n\nHow many insights do you need? Well, I\u2019'd argue that you don\u2019t need many in a lifetime. If you look at Berkshire Hathaway and\nall of its accumulated billions, the top 10 insights account for most of it. And that\u2019s with a very brilliant man\u2014Warren\u2019s a lot more\nable than I am and very disciplined\u2014devoting his lifetime to it. I don\u2019t mean to say that he\u2019s only had 10 insights. I\u2019m just saying\nthat most of the money came from 10 insights.\n\nSo you can get very remarkable investment results if you think more like a winning pari mutuel player. Just think of it as a\nheavy-odds against game full of bullshit and craziness with an occasional mispriced something or other. And you're probably not\ngoing to be smart enough to find thousands in a lifetime. And when you get a few, you really load up. It\u2019s just that simple.\n\nWhen Warren lectures at business schools, he says, \u201cI could improve your ultimate financial welfare by giving you a ticket with\nonly 20 slots in it so that you had 20 punches, representing all the investments that you got to make in a lifetime. And once you'd\npunched through the card, you couldn't make any more investments at all.\u201d He says, \u201cUnder those rules, you'd really think care-\nfully about what you did, and you'd be forced to load up on what you'd really thought about. So you'd do so much better.\u201d\n\nAgain, this is a concept that seems perfectly obvious to me. And to Warren, it seems perfectly obvious. But this is one of the very\nfew business classes in the United States where anybody will be saying so. It just isn\u2019t the conventional wisdom.\n\nTo me, it\u2019s obvious that the winner has to bet very selectively. It\u2019s been obvious to me since very early in life. I don\u2019t know why\nit\u2019s not obvious to very many other people.\n\nI think the reason why we got into such idiocy in investment management is best illustrated by a story that I tell about the guy\nwho sold fishing tackle. I asked him, \u201cMy god, they\u2019re purple and green. Do fish really take these lures?\u201d And he said, \u201cMister, I don\u2019t\nsell to fish.\u201d\n\f"}, "003868.png": {"text": "Investment managers are in the position of that fishing tackle salesman. They\u2019re like the guy who was selling salt to the guy\nwho already had too much salt. And as long as the guy will buy salt, why, they\u2019ll sell salt. But that isn\u2019t what ordinarily works for\nthe buyer of investment advice.\n\nIf you invested Berkshire Hathaway-style, it would be hard to get paid as an investment manager as well as they\u2019re currently\npaid, because you'd be holding a block of Walmart and a block of Coca-Cola and a block of something else. You'd be sitting on your\nass. And the client would be getting rich. And, after a while, the client would think, \u201cWhy am I paying this guy half a percent a year\non my wonderful passive holdings?\u201d\n\nSo what makes sense for the investor is different from what makes sense for the manager. And, as usual in human affairs, what\ndetermines the behavior are incentives for the decision maker, and getting the incentives right is a very, very important lesson.\n\nFrom all businesses, my favorite case on incentives is Federal Express. The heart and soul of its system, which creates the\nintegrity of the product, is having all its airplanes come to one place in the middle of the night and shift all the packages from plane\nto plane. If there are delays, the whole operation can\u2019t deliver a product full of integrity to Federal Express customers. And it was\nalways screwed up. They could never get it done on time. They tried everything\u2014moral suasion, threats, you name it. And nothing\nworked. Finally, somebody got the idea to pay all these people not so much an hour but so much a shift, and when it\u2019s all done, they\ncan all go home. Well, their problems cleared up overnight.\n\nSo getting the incentives right is a very, very important lesson. It was not obvious to Federal Express what the solution was. But\nmaybe now, it will hereafter more often be obvious to you.\n\nAll right, we\u2019ve now recognized that the market is efficient as a pari mutuel system is efficient\u2014with the favorite more likely\nthan the long shot to do well in racing but not necessarily give any betting advantage to those who bet on the favorite.\n\nIn the stock market, some railroad that\u2019s beset by better competitors and tough unions may be available at one third of its book\nvalue. In contrast, IBM in its heyday might be selling at six times book value. So it\u2019s just like the pari mutuel system. Any damn fool\n\ncould plainly see that IBM had better business prospects than the railroad. But once you put the price into the formula, it wasn\u2019t\n\f"}, "003869.png": {"text": "so clear anymore what was going to work best for a buyer choosing between the stocks. So it\u2019s a lot like a pari mutuel system. And,\ntherefore, it gets very hard to beat.\n\nWhat style should the investor use as a picker of common stocks in order to try to beat the market\u2014in other words, to get an\nabove-average long term result? A standard technique that appeals to a lot of people is called sector rotation. You simply figure out\nwhen oils are going to outperform retailers, etc., etc., etc. You just kind of flit around being in the hot sector of the market making\nbetter choices than other people. And presumably, over a long period of time, you get ahead.\n\nHowever, I know of no really rich sector rotator. Maybe some people can do it. I\u2019m not saying they can\u2019t. All] know is that all the\npeople I know who got rich\u2014and I know a lot of them\u2014did not do it that way.\n\nThe second basic approach is the one that Ben Graham used, much admired by Warren and me. As one factor, Graham had\nthis concept of value to a private owner\u2014what the whole enterprise would sell for if it were available. And that was calculable in\nmany cases. Then, if you could take the stock price and multiply it by the number of shares and get something that was one third\nor less of sellout value, he would say that you've got a lot of edge going for you. Even with an elderly alcoholic running a stodgy\nbusiness, this significant excess of real value per share working for you means that all kinds of good things can happen to you. You\nhad a huge margin of safety, as he put it, by having this big excess value going for you.\n\nBut he was, by and large, operating when the world was in shell shock from the 1930s, which was the worst contraction in the\nEnglish speaking world in about 600 years. Wheat in Liverpool, I believe, got down to something like a 600 year low, adjusted for\ninflation. People were so shell shocked for a long time thereafter that Ben Graham could run his Geiger counter over this detritus\nfrom the collapse of the 1930s and find things selling below their working capital per share and so on. And in those days, working\ncapital actually belonged to the shareholders. If the employees were no longer useful, you just sacked them all, took the working\ncapital, and stuck it in the owners\u2019 pockets. That was the way capitalism then worked.\n\nNowadays, of course, the accounting is not realistic, because the minute the business starts contracting, significant assets are\nnot there. Under social norms and the new legal rules of the civilization, so much is owed to the employees that the minute the en-\n\nterprise goes into reverse, some of the assets on the balance sheet aren\u2019t there anymore.\n\f"}, "003870.png": {"text": "Now, that might not be true if you run a little auto dealership yourself. You may be able to run it in a way that there\u2019s no health\nplan and this and that so that if the business gets lousy, you can take your working capital and go home. But IBM can\u2019t, or at least\ndidn\u2019t. Just look at what disappeared from its balance sheet when it decided that it had to change size both because the world had\nchanged technologically and because its market position had deteriorated.\n\nAnd in terms of blowing it, IBM is some example. Those were brilliant, disciplined people. But there was enough turmoil in\ntechnological change that IBM got bounced off the wave after surfing successfully for 60 years. And that was some collapse\u2014an\nobject lesson in the difficulties of technology and one of the reasons why Buffett and Munger don\u2019t like technology very much. We\ndon\u2019t think we're any good at it, and strange things can happen.\n\nAt any rate, the trouble with what I call the classic Ben Graham concept is that gradually the world wised up, and those real\nobvious bargains disappeared. You could run your Geiger counter over the rubble, and it wouldn't click.\n\nBut such is the nature of people who have a hammer\u2014to whom, as I mentioned, every problem looks like a nail\u2014that the Ben\nGraham followers responded by changing the calibration on their Geiger counters. In effect, they started defining a bargain ina\ndifferent way. And they kept changing the definition so that they could keep doing what they\u2019d always done. And it still worked\npretty well. So the Ben Graham intellectual system was a very good one.\n\nOf course, the best part of it all was his concept of Mr. Market. Instead of thinking the market was efficient, Graham treated it\nas a manic depressive who comes by every day. And some days Mr. Market says, \u201cI'll sell you some of my interest for way less than\nyou think it\u2019s worth.\u201d And other days, he comes by and says, \u201cI'll buy your interest at a price that\u2019s way higher than you think it\u2019s\nworth.\u201d And you get the option of deciding whether you want to buy more, sell part of what you already have, or do nothing at all.\n\nTo Graham, it was a blessing to be in business with a manic-depressive who gave you this series of options all the time. That\nwas a very significant mental construct. And it\u2019s been very useful to Buffett, for instance, over his whole adult lifetime. However, if\nwe'd stayed with classic Graham the way Ben Graham did it, we would never have had the record we have. And that\u2019s because Gra-\n\nham wasn\u2019t trying to do what we did.\n\f"}, "003871.png": {"text": "For example, Graham didn\u2019t want to ever talk to management. And his reason was that, like the best sort of professor aiming his\nteaching at a mass audience, he was trying to invent a system that anybody could use. And he didn\u2019t feel that the man in the street\ncould run around and talk to management and learn things. He also had a concept that management would often couch the infor-\nmation very shrewdly to mislead. Therefore, it was very difficult. And that is still true, of course, human nature being what it is.\n\nAnd so, having started out as Grahamites\u2014which, by the way, worked fine\u2014we gradually got what I would call better insights.\nAnd we realized that some company that was selling at two or three times book value could still be a hell of a bargain because of\nmomentums implicit in its position, sometimes combined with an unusual managerial skill plainly present in some individual or\nother or some system or other. And once we'd gotten over the hurdle of recognizing that a thing could be a bargain based on quan-\ntitative measures that would have horrified Graham, we started thinking about better businesses.\n\nAnd, by the way, the bulk of the billions in Berkshire Hathaway have come from the better businesses. Much of the first $200\nor $300 million came from scrambling around with our Geiger counter. But the great bulk of the money has come from the great\nbusinesses. And even some of the early money was made by being temporarily present in great businesses. Buffett Partnership, for\nexample, owned American Express and Disney when they got pounded down.\n\n[Most investment managers are] in a game where the clients expect them to know a lot about a lot of things. We didn\u2019t have any\nclients who could fire us at Berkshire Hathaway. So we didn\u2019t have to be governed by any such construct. And we came to this no-\ntion of finding a mispriced bet and loading up when we were very confident that we were right. So we're way less diversified. And I\nthink our system is miles better.\n\nHowever, in all fairness, I don\u2019t think [a lot of money managers] could successfully sell their services if they used our system.\nBut if you're investing for 40 years in some pension fund, what difference does it make if the path from start to finish is a little\nmore bumpy or a little different than everybody else\u2019s so long as it\u2019s all going to work out well in the end? So what if there\u2019s a little\nextra volatility? In investment management today, everybody wants not only to win but to have the path never diverge very much\n\nfrom a standard path except on the upside. Well, that is a very artificial, crazy construct. That is really hobbling yourself.\n\f"}, "003872.png": {"text": "Now, investment managers would say, \u201cWe have to be that way. That\u2019s how we\u2019re measured.\u201d And they may be right in terms of\nthe way the business is now constructed. But from the viewpoint of a rational consumer, the whole system\u2019s bonkers and draws a\nlot of talented people into socially useless activity. And the Berkshire system is not bonkers. It\u2019s so damned elementary that even\nbright people are going to have limited, really valuable insights in a very competitive world when they\u2019re fighting against other\nvery bright, hardworking people.\n\nAnd it makes sense to load up on the very few good insights you have instead of pretending to know everything about every-\nthing at all times. You\u2019re much more likely to do well if you start out to do something feasible instead of something that isn\u2019t\nfeasible. Isn\u2019t that perfectly obvious? How many of you have 56 brilliant insights in which you have equal confidence? Raise your\nhands, please. How many of you have two or three insights that you have some confidence in? I rest my case.\n\nWe've really made the money out of high quality businesses. In some cases, we bought the whole business, and in some cases,\nwe just bought a big block of stock. But when you analyze what happened, the big money\u2019s been made in the high quality busi-\nnesses. And most of the other people who've made a lot of money have done so in highquality businesses.\n\nT\u2019d say that Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s system is adapting to the nature of the investment problem as it really is. Over the long term,\nit\u2019s hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business that underlies it earns. If the business earns 6 percent on capital\nover 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you're not going to make much different than a 6 percent return, even if you origi-\nnally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18 percent on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expen-\nsive looking price, you'll end up with one hell of a result. So the trick is getting into better businesses. And that involves all of these\nadvantages of scale that you could consider momentum effects.\n\nHow do you get into these great companies? One method is what I'd call the method of finding them small\u2014get \u2019em when\nthey\u2019re little. For example, buy Walmart when Sam Walton first goes public and so forth. A lot of people try to do just that. And\nit\u2019s a very beguiling idea. If I were a young man, I might actually go into it. But it doesn\u2019t work for Berkshire Hathaway anymore\n\nbecause we've got too much money. We can\u2019t find anything that fits our size parameter that way. Besides, we\u2019re set in our ways. But\n\f"}, "003873.png": {"text": "I regard finding them small as a perfectly intelligent approach for somebody to try with discipline. It\u2019s just not something that I\u2019ve\ndone.\n\nFinding \u2019em big obviously is very hard because of the competition. So far, Berkshire\u2019s managed to do it. But can we continue to\ndo it? What's the next Coca Cola investment for us? Well, the answer to that is I don\u2019t know. I think it gets harder for us all the time.\nAnd ideally\u2014and we've done a lot of this\u2014you get into a great business that also has a great manager, because management\nmatters. For example, it\u2019s made a hell of a difference to General Electric that Jack Welch came in instead of the guy who took over\n\n\u2018Westinghouse\u2014one hell of a difference. So management matters, too. And some of it is predictable. I do not think it takes a ge-\nnius to understand that Jack Welch was a more insightful person and a better manager than his peers in other companies. Nor\ndo I think it took tremendous genius to understand that Disney had basic momentums in place that are very powerful, and that\n[Michael] Eisner and [Frank] Wells were very unusual managers.\n\nSo you do get an occasional opportunity to get into a wonderful business that\u2019s being run by a wonderful manager. And, of\ncourse, that\u2019s hog heaven day. If you don\u2019t load up when you get those opportunities, it\u2019s a big mistake.\n\nOccasionally, you'll find a human being who's so talented that he can do things that ordinary skilled mortals can\u2019t. I would\nargue that Simon Marks~\u201c\u2014who was second generation in Marks & Spencer of England\u2014was such a man. Patterson was such a\nman at National Cash Register. And Sam Walton was such a man. These people do come along, and, in many cases, they\u2019re not all\nthat hard to identify. If they\u2019ve got a reasonable hand\u2014with the fanaticism and intelligence and so on that these people generally\nbring to the party\u2014then management can matter very much.\n\nHowever, averaged out, betting on the quality of a business is better than betting on the quality of management. In other words,\nif you have to choose one, bet on the business momentum, not the brilliance of the manager. But very rarely, you find a manager\nwho's so good that you're wise to follow him into what looks like a mediocre business.\n\nAnother very simple effect I very seldom see discussed either by investment managers or anybody else is the effect of taxes. If\nyou're going to buy something that compounds for 30 years at 15 percent per annum and you pay one 35 percent tax at the very\n\nend, the way that works out is that after taxes, you keep 13.3 percent per annum.\n\f"}, "003874.png": {"text": "In contrast, if you bought the same investment but had to pay taxes every year of 35 percent out of the 15 percent that you\nearned, then your return would be 15 percent minus 35 percent of 15 percent, or only 9.75 percent per year compounded. So the\ndifference there is over 3.5 percent. And what 3.5 percent does to the numbers over long holding periods like 30 years is truly eye\nopening. If you sit on your ass for long, long stretches in great companies, you can get a huge edge from nothing but the way in-\ncome taxes work.\n\nEven with a 10 percent per annum investment, paying a 35 percent tax at the end gives you 8.3 percent after taxes as an annual\ncompounded result after 30 years. In contrast, if you pay the 35 percent each year instead of at the end, your annual result goes\ndown to 6.5 percent. So you add nearly 2 percent of after tax return per annum if you only achieve an average return by historical\nstandards from common stock investments in companies with low dividend payout ratios.\n\nBut in terms of business mistakes that I\u2019ve seen over a long lifetime, I would say that trying to minimize taxes too much is one\nof the great standard causes of really dumb mistakes. I see terrible mistakes from people being overly motivated by tax considera-\ntions. Warren and I personally don\u2019t drill oil wells. We pay our taxes. And we've done pretty well so far. Anytime somebody offers\nyou a tax shelter from here on in life, my advice would be don\u2019t buy it. In fact, anytime anybody offers you anything with a big\ncommission and a 200 page prospectus, don\u2019t buy it. Occasionally, you'll be wrong if you adopt Munger\u2019s rule. However, over a life-\ntime, you'll be a long way ahead\u2014and you will miss a lot of unhappy experiences that might otherwise reduce your love for your\nfellow man.\n\nThere are huge advantages for an individual to get into a position where you make a few great investments and just sit on your\nass: You're paying less to brokers. You're listening to less nonsense. And if it works, the governmental tax system gives you an extra\n1, 2, or 3 percentage points per annum compounded. And you think that most of you are going to get that much advantage by hir-\ning investment counselors and paying them 1 percent to run around, incurring a lot of taxes on your behalf? Lots of luck.\n\nAre there any dangers in this philosophy? Yes. Everything in life has dangers. Since it\u2019s so obvious that investing in great\ncompanies works, it gets horribly overdone from time to time. In the \u201cnifty 50\u201d days, everybody could tell which companies were\n\nthe great ones. So they got up to 50, 60, and 70 times earnings. And just as IBM fell off the wave, other companies did too. Thus, a\n\f"}, "003875.png": {"text": "large investment disaster resulted from too high prices. And you've got to be aware of that danger. So there are risks. Nothing is\nautomatic and easy. But if you can find some fairly priced, great company and buy it and sit, that tends to work out very, very well\nindeed\u2014especially for an individual.\n\nWithin the growth stock model, there\u2019s a sub position: There are actually businesses that you will find a few times in a lifetime\nwhere any manager could raise the return enormously just by raising prices, and yet they haven't done it. So they have huge un-\ntapped pricing power that they\u2019re not using. That is the ultimate no brainer.\n\nThat existed in Disney. It\u2019s such a unique experience to take your grandchild to Disneyland. You're not doing it that often. And\nthere are lots of people in the country. And Disney found that it could raise those prices a lot and the attendance stayed right up. So\nalot of the great record of Eisner and Wells was utter brilliance, but the rest came from just raising prices at Disneyland and Disney\nWorld and through videocassette sales of classic animated movies.\n\nAt Berkshire Hathaway, Warren and I raised the prices of See\u2019s Candies a little faster than others might have. And, of course, we\ninvested in Coca Cola, which had some untapped pricing power. And it also had brilliant management. So a [Roberto] Goizueta and\n[Donald] Keough could do much more than raise prices. It was perfect.\n\nYou will get a few opportunities to profit from finding underpricing. There are actually people out there who don't price ev-\nerything as high as the market will easily stand. And once you figure that out, it\u2019s like finding money in the street, if you have the\ncourage of your convictions.\n\nIf you look at Berkshire\u2019s investments where a lot of the money\u2019s been made and you look for the models, you can see that we\ntwice bought into two newspaper towns, which have since become one-newspaper towns. So we made a bet to some extent. In\none of those\u2014The Washington Post\u2014we bought it at about 20 percent of the value to a private owner. So we bought it on a Ben\nGraham-style basis\u2014at one fifth of obvious value\u2014and, in addition, we faced a situation where you had both the top hand ina\ngame that was clearly going to end up with one winner and a management with a lot of integrity and intelligence. That one was a\n\nreal dream. They\u2019re very high-class people, the Katharine Graham family. That\u2019s why it was a dream\u2014an absolute, damn dream.\n\f"}, "003876.png": {"text": "Of course, that came about back in\u201973,\u201974. And that was almost like 1932. That was probably a once in 40 years type denoue-\nment in the markets. That investment\u2019s up about 50 times over our cost. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t count on getting any investment\nin your lifetime quite as good as The Washington Post was in\u201973 and\u201974.\n\nLet me mention another model. Of course, Gillette and Coke make fairly low priced items and have a tremendous marketing\nadvantage all over the world. And in Gillette\u2019s case, they keep surfing along new technology, which is fairly simple by the standards\nof microchips. But it\u2019s hard for competitors to do. So they\u2019ve been able to stay constantly near the edge of improvements in shav-\ning. There are whole countries where Gillette has more than 90 percent of the shaving market.\n\nGEICO\u2122 isa very interesting model. It\u2019s another one of the hundred or so models you ought to have in your head. I\u2019ve had many\nfriends in the sick business fix game over a long lifetime. And they practically all use the following formula\u2014I call it the cancer\nsurgery formula. They look at this mess, and they figure out if there\u2019s anything sound left that can live on its own if they cut away\neverything else. And if they find anything sound, they just cut away everything else. Of course, if that doesn\u2019t work, they liquidate\nthe business. But it frequently does work.\n\nAnd GEICO had a perfectly magnificent business\u2014submerged in a mess, but still working. Misled by success, GEICO had done\nsome foolish things. They got to thinking that, because they were making a lot of money, they knew everything. And they suffered\nhuge losses. All they had to do was to cut out all the folly and go back to the perfectly wonderful business that was lying there. And\nwhen you think about it, that\u2019s a very simple model. And it\u2019s repeated over and over again. And, in GEICO\u2019s case, think about all the\nmoney we passively made. It was a wonderful business combined with a bunch of foolishness that could easily be cut out. And\npeople were coming in who were temperamentally and intellectually designed so they were going to cut it out.\n\nThat is a model you want to look for. And you may find one or two or three in a long lifetime that are very good. And you may\nfind 20 or 30 that are good enough to be quite useful.\n\nFinally, I'd like to once again talk about investment management. That is a funny business, because on a net basis, the whole\n\ninvestment management business together gives no value added to all buyers combined. That\u2019s the way it has to work.\n\f"}, "003877.png": {"text": "Of course, that isn\u2019t true of plumbing, and it isn\u2019t true of medicine.

But if you want to\nlive the best sort of life, I would urge each of you not to use the psychological denial mode.\n\nI think a select few\u2014a small percentage of the investment managers\u2014can deliver value added.

I think that you have to have a little of this discipline of calling your shots and loading up if you want to maxi-\nmize your chances of becoming one who provides above average real returns for clients over the long pull.\n\nBut I\u2019m just talking about investment managers engaged in common stock picking. I am agnostic elsewhere. I think there may\nwell be people who are so shrewd about currencies and this, that, and the other thing that they can achieve good long term records\noperating on a pretty big scale in that way. But that doesn\u2019t happen to be my milieu. I\u2019m talking about stock picking in American\n\nstocks.

By investing in LBO [leveraged buyout] funds, Harvard and Yale introduced leverage into their results from owning interests\nin US businesses. And the LBO fund structure gave them a way to make their leveraged business investments in a manner\nsafer than is possible in a normal margin account, prone during panics to forced sales. Decent comparative results often fol-\nlowed in markets with tolerable general outcomes. And this happened even when net-after-cost results from investments in\n\nthe LBO funds were no better than would have occurred through only slightly leveraged investment in an index of US stocks.\n\nNn\n\n. In category after category, Harvard and Yale selected or directly employed investment managers who were way above average\nin ability, providing additional evidence that investment markets are not perfectly efficient and that some good investment\nresults come from abnormal skill or other abnormal advantage. As one example, Harvard and Yale, by reason of their own\nprestige, were able to get into some of the most profitable high-tech venture capital funds not available to all other investors.\nThese funds, using momentum provided by their own past success, had an opportunity advantage over less well-established\n\nventure capital operations in that the best entrepreneurs, quite logically, made early presentations to the best-regarded funds.\n\n\u00bb\n\n. Harvard and Yale wisely and opportunistically imitated investment banking firms by going into several activities that were\nthen nontraditional, like investing in distressed US corporate bonds and high-coupon foreign bonds and leveraged fixed in-\n\ncome arbitrage, during a period when many good opportunities were available to skilled operators in the activities chosen.\n\nS\n\n. Finally, the benefits that came to Harvard and Yale in recent years through leverage and unconventionality were often, of\n\ncourse, given a large tailwind by a happy combination of declining interest rates and rising price-earnings ratios for stocks.\n\nThe extreme investment success of Harvard and Yale gives me both pleasure and pain. My pleasure comes from this demon-\nstration that academic skill is often useful in worldly affairs. People like me who were attracted by academia yet have gone into\n\nbusiness naturally respond to such worldly achievement much like the many modern scientists who relish the example of Thales\n\f"}, "003879.png": {"text": "of Miletus.~ This scientist of antiquity made a large profit by leasing most of the olive presses in his area just before the occurrence\nof a particularly bountiful harvest.\n\nMy pain comes from 1) foreseeing a lot of future adversity for other worthy institutions, driven by envy and salesmen into\nenthusiastic imitation of Harvard and Yale, and 2) disapproval of the conduct of many of the salesmen likely to succeed in pushing\nthe imitation\u2014something similar to what I fear happened near the end of the high-tech bubble. At that time, envy of successful\nearly-stage, high-tech venture capital investors like Stanford, plus the dubious sales methods of many venture capitalists, caused\nabout $90 billion to rush into low-quality, imitative early-stage ventures that by now may have created as much as $45 billion in\nnet losses for late-coming investors.\n\nMoreover, Harvard and Yale may now need new displays of unconventional wisdom that are different from their last displays.\nIt is quite counterintuitive to decrease that part of one\u2019s activity that has recently worked best, but this is often a good idea.

You were assigned a\ntranscript of my USC talk. There\u2019s nothing I said then that I wouldn\u2019t repeat today. But I want to amplify what I said then.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly clear that if Warren Buffett had never learned anything new after graduating from the Columbia Business School,\nBerkshire would be a pale shadow of its present self. Warren would have gotten rich, because what he learned from Ben Graham at\nColumbia was enough to make anybody rich. But he wouldn't have the kind of enterprise Berkshire Hathaway is if he hadn\u2019t kept\nlearning.\n\nHow do you get worldly wisdom? What system do you use to rise into the tiny top percentage of the world in terms of having\nsort of an elementary, practical wisdom?\n\nT\u2019ve long believed that a certain system, which almost any intelligent person can learn, works way better than the systems that\nmost people use. As I said at the USC Business School, what you need is a latticework of mental models in your head. And you hang\nyour actual experience and your vicarious experience that you get from reading and so forth on this latticework of powerful mod-\n\nels. And with that system, things gradually get to fit together in a way that enhances cognition.\n\n[Charlie discusses several of the specific mental models elaborated in other talks.]\n\f"}, "003884.png": {"text": "Your assigned reading for today included the latest annual letters from Jack Welch and Warren Buffett relating to General\nElectric and Berkshire Hathaway, respectively. Jack Welch has a PhD in engineering, and Warren plainly could have gotten a PhD in\nany field he wanted to pursue. And both gentlemen are inveterate teachers. Worldly wisdom is quite academic when you get right\ndown to it. Look at what General Electric has achieved\u2014and, for that matter, what Berkshire Hathaway has achieved.\n\nOf course, Warren had a professor and mentor, Ben Graham, for whom he had a great affection. Graham was so academic that\nwhen he graduated from Columbia, three different academic departments invited him into their PhD programs and asked him to\nstart teaching immediately as part of the PhD program: literature, Greek and Latin classics, and mathematics.\n\nGraham had a very academic personality. I knew him. He was a lot like Adam. smith~\u2014very preoccupied, very brilliant. He even\nlooked like an academic. And he was a good one. And Graham, without ever really trying to maximize the gaining of wealth, died\nrich\u2014even though he was always generous and spent 30 years teaching at Columbia and authored or coauthored the best text-\nbooks in his field. So I would argue that academia has a lot to teach about worldly wisdom and that the best academic values really\nwork.\n\nOf course, when I urge a multidisciplinary approach\u2014that you've got to have the main models from a broad array of disciplines,\nand you've got to use them all\u2014I\u2019m really asking you to ignore jurisdictional boundaries. And the world isn\u2019t organized that way.\nIt discourages the jumping of jurisdictional boundaries. Big bureaucratic businesses discourage it. And, of course, academia itself\ndiscourages it. All I can say there is that, in that respect, academia is horribly wrong and dysfunctional.\n\nSome of the worst dysfunctions in businesses come from the fact that they balkanize reality into little individual departments,\nwith territoriality and turf protection and so forth. So if you want to be a good thinker, you must develop a mind that can jump the\njurisdictional boundaries. You don\u2019t have to know it all. Just take in the best big ideas from all these disciplines. And it\u2019s not that\nhard to do.\n\nI might try and demonstrate that point using the card game of contract bridge. Suppose you want to be good at declarer play\nin contract bridge. Well, you know the contract\u2014you know what you have to achieve. And you can count up the sure winners\n\nyou have by laying down your high cards and your invincible trumps. But if you're a trick or two short, how are you going to get\n\f"}, "003885.png": {"text": "the other needed tricks? Well, there are only six or so different standard methods. You've got long suit establishment. You've got\nfinesses. You've got throw-in plays. You've got crossruffs. You've got squeezes. And you've got various ways of misleading the\ndefense into making errors. So it\u2019s a very limited number of models. But if you only know one or two of those models, then you\u2019re\ngoing to be a horse\u2019s patoot in declarer play. Furthermore, these things interact. Therefore, you have to know how the models inter-\nact. Otherwise, you can\u2019t play the hand right.\n\nSimilarly, I\u2019ve told you to think forward and backward. Well, great declarers in bridge think, \u201cHow can I take the necessary\nwinners?\u201d But they think it through backward, too: \u201cWhat could possibly go wrong that could cause me to have too many losers?\u201d\nBoth methods of thinking are useful. So in the game of life, get the needed models into your head and think it through forward and\nbackward. What works in bridge will work in life.\n\nThat contract bridge is so out of vogue in your generation is a tragedy. China is way smarter than we are about bridge. They\u2019re\nteaching bridge in grade school now. And God knows the Chinese do well enough when introduced to capitalist civilization. If we\ncompete with a bunch of people who really know how to play bridge when our people don't, it\u2019ll be just one more disadvantage we\ndon\u2019t need.\n\nSince your academic structure, by and large, doesn\u2019t encourage minds jumping jurisdictional boundaries, you're at a disadvan-\ntage because, in that one sense, even though academia\u2019s very useful to you, you've been mistaught. My solution for you is one that I\ngot at a very early age, from the nursery: the story of the Little Red Hen.* The punch line, of course, is: \u201cThen I'll do it myself, said\nthe Little Red Hen.\u201d\n\nSo if your professors won't give you an appropriate multidisciplinary approach\u2014if each wants to overuse his own models and\nunderuse the important models in other disciplines\u2014you can correct that folly yourself. Just because he\u2019s a horse\u2019s patoot, you\ndon\u2019t have to be one too. You can reach out and grasp the model that better solves the overall problem. All you have to do is know\nit and develop the right mental habits. And it\u2019s kind of fun to sit there and outthink people who are way smarter than you are be-\ncause you've trained yourself to be more objective and multidisciplinary. Furthermore, there\u2019s a lot of money in it\u2014as I can testify\n\nfrom my own personal experience.\n\f"}, "003886.png": {"text": "[Charlie begins the Coca-Cola business case detailed in Talk Four, \u201cPractical Thought about Practical Thought?,\u201d and discusses the impor-\n\ntance of flavor.]\n\nOne of my favorite business stories comes from Hershey. They get their flavor because they make their cocoa butter in old\nstone grinders that they started with in the 1800s in Pennsylvania. And a little bit of the husk of the cocoa bean winds up in the\nchocolate. Therefore, they get that odd flavor that people like in Hershey\u2019s chocolate.\n\nHershey knew enough when they wanted to expand into Canada to know they shouldn't change their winning flavor. There-\nfore, they copied their stone grinders. Well, it took them five years to duplicate their own flavor. As you can see, flavors can be quite\ntricky. Even today, there\u2019s a company called International Flavors and Fragrances. It\u2019s the only company I know that does some-\nthing on which you can\u2019t get a copyright or a patent but which nevertheless receives a permanent royalty. They manage to do that\nby helping companies develop flavors and aromas in their trademarked products, like shaving cream. The slight aroma of shaving\n\ncream is very important to consumption. So all of this stuff is terribly important.\n\n[Continuing the Coca-Cola case study, Charlie explains how our understanding of graphic depictions of mathematical ideas are rooted in\n\nbiology.]\n\nMy friend, Dr. Nat Myhrvold, who's the chief technology officer at Microsoft, is bothered by this.

The so-called fitness landscape of our ancestors forced them to\nknow how to throw spears, run around, turn corners, and what have you long before they had to think correctly like Myhrvold. Sol\n\ndon\u2019t think he should be so surprised. However, the difference is so extreme that I can understand how he finds it incongruous.\n\f"}, "003887.png": {"text": "At any rate, mankind invented a system to cope with the fact that we are so intrinsically lousy at manipulating numbers.

And I\u2019m here trying to help you avoid some of the perils that might other-\nwise result from that miseducation.\n\nOkay. We've been through some of the general ideas in the search for worldly wisdom. And now I want to turn to something\neven more extreme and peculiar than the talk I\u2019ve already given you. Of all the models that people ought to have in useful form and\ndon't, perhaps the most important lie in the area of psychology.\n\nIrecently had an instructive experience. I just returned from Hong Kong. I have a pal there who\u2019s a headmaster of one of the\nleading schools. He gave me this book called The Language Instinct, written by Steven Pinker. Well, Pinker is a semanticist pro-\nfessor who rose in the shadow of Noam Chomsky, Linguistics Institute professor at MIT, who is probably the greatest semanticist\nwho ever lived. And Pinker says that human language ability is not just learned\u2014it\u2019s deeply buried, to a considerable extent, in the\ngenome. It\u2019s not in the genome of the other animals, including the chimpanzee, to any really useful extent. It\u2019s a gift that came to\n\nhumans. And Pinker proves his point pretty well. Of course, Chomsky\u2019s already proven it. You have to be pretty ignorant not to\n\f"}, "003889.png": {"text": "realize that a good deal of language ability is right there in the human genome. And even though you have to work like hell to im-\nprove it through education, you start with a big leg up in your genes.\n\nPinker can\u2019t understand why Chomsky\u2014who, again, is such a genius\u2014takes the position that the jury\u2019s still out about why this\nability is in the human genome. Pinker, in effect, says, \u201cLike hell, the jury is still out! The language instinct got into humans in ex-\nactly the same way that everything else got there\u2014through Darwinian natural selection.\u201d\n\nWell, the junior professor is clearly right, and Chomsky\u2019s hesitation is a little daft. But if the junior professor and 1 are right, how\nhas a genius like Chomsky made an obvious misjudgment? The answer\u2019s quite clear to me: Chomsky is passionately ideological. He\nis an extreme egalitarian leftist who happens to be a genius. And he\u2019s so smart that he realized that if he concedes this particular\nDarwinian point, the implications threaten his leftist ideology. So he naturally has his conclusion affected by his ideological bias.\nAnd that gets into another lesson in worldly wisdom: If ideology can screw up the head of Chomsky, imagine what it does to peo-\nple like you and me.\n\nIdeology does some strange things and distorts cognition terribly. If you get a lot of heavy ideology young, and then you start\nexpressing it, you are really locking your brain into a very unfortunate pattern. And you are going to distort your general cogni-\ntion.\n\nThere\u2019s a very interesting history if you take Warren Buffett as an example of worldly wisdom. Warren adored his father, who\nwas a wonderful man. But Warren\u2019s father was a very heavy ideologue\u2014right wing, it happened to be\u2014who hung around with\nother very heavy ideologues\u2014right wing, naturally. Warren observed this as a kid, and he decided that ideology was dangerous\nand that he was going to stay a long way away from it. And he has throughout his whole life. That has enormously helped the accu-\nracy of his cognition.\n\nIlearned the same lesson in a different way. My father hated ideology. Therefore, all I had to do was imitate my father and,\nthereby, stay on what I regard as the right path. People like [Bob] Dornan on the right or [Ralph] Nader on the left have obviously\ngone a little daft. They\u2019re extreme examples of what ideology will do to you\u2014particularly violently expressed ideology. Since it\n\npounds ideas in better than it convinces out, it\u2019s a very dangerous thing to do.\n\f"}, "003890.png": {"text": "Therefore, in a system of multiple models across multiple disciplines, I should add as an extra rule that you should be very wary\nof heavy ideology. You can have heavy ideology in favor of accuracy, diligence, and objectivity. But a heavy ideology that makes\nyou absolutely sure that the minimum wage should be raised or that it shouldn\u2019t, and it\u2019s kind of a holy construct where you know\nyou're right, makes you a bit nuts.\n\nThis is a very complicated system. And life is one damn relatedness after another. It\u2019s all right to think that, on balance, you\nsuspect that civilization is better if it lowers the minimum wage or raises it. Either position is okay. But being totally sure on is-\nsues like that with a strong, violent ideology, in my opinion, turns you into a lousy thinker. So beware of ideology-based mental\n\nmisfunctions.\n\n[Charlie laments how poorly the field of psychology deals with incentive-caused bias.]\n\nAnother reason that I mentioned Pinker, the semanticist who wrote the book that I told you about earlier, is that at the end of\nhis book, he says, roughly, \u201cI\u2019ve read the psychology textbooks. And they\u2019re daft.\u201d He says, \u201cThis whole subject is misorganized and\nmistaught.\u201d\n\nWell, I have far less in the way of qualifications than Pinker. In fact, I\u2019ve never taken a single course in psychology. However, I\u2019ve\ncome to exactly the same conclusion\u2014that the psychology texts, while they are wonderful in part, are also significantly daft.\n\nIn fact, just take simple psychological denial. About three centuries before the birth of Christ, Demosthenes said, \u201cWhat a man\nwishes, that also will he believe.\u201d Well, Demosthenes was right.\n\nThad a family acquaintance whose much-loved son, who was brilliant and a star football player, flew off over the ocean and\nnever came back. Well, his mother thought he was still alive. The mind will sometimes flip so that the wish becomes the belief. It\n\nwill do so at various levels. Individuals vary in how much psychological denial they get. But miscognition from denial overwhelm-\n\f"}, "003891.png": {"text": "ingly pervades the reality that you're going to have to deal with. And yet, you won't find an adequate treatment of simple psycho-\nlogical denial in psychology texts.\n\nSo you can\u2019t learn psychology the way your professors teach it. You've got to learn everything they teach, but you've got to learn\nalot more that they don\u2019t teach, because they don\u2019t handle their own subject correctly.\n\nPsychology, to me, as currently organized, is like electromagnetism after [Michael] Faraday~ but before Maxwell\u2014a lot has been.\ndiscovered, but no one mind has put it all together in proper form. And it should be done because it wouldn't be that hard to do\u2014\nand it\u2019s enormously important.\n\nJust open a psychology text, turn to the index, and look up envy. Well, envy made it into one or two or three of the Ten Com-\nmandments. Moses knew all about envy. The old Jews, when they were herding sheep, knew all about envy. It\u2019s just that psychology\nprofessors don\u2019t know about envy. Books that thick are teaching a psychology course without envy? And with no simple psycho-\nlogical denial? And no incentive-caused bias?\n\nAnd psychological texts don\u2019t deal adequately with combinations of factors. I told you earlier to be aware of the lollapalooza\neffect, when two or three or more forces are operating in the same direction. Well, the single most publicized psychology ex-\nperiment ever done is the Milgram experiment, where they asked people to apply what they had every reason to believe was\nheavy electrical torture on innocent fellow human beings. And they manipulated most of these decent volunteers into doing the\ntorture. [Stanley] Milgram performed the experiment right after Hitler had gotten a bunch of believing Lutherans, Catholics, and\nso forth to perform unholy acts they should have known were wrong. Milgram was trying to find out how much authority could be\nused to manipulate high-grade people into doing things that were clearly and grossly wrong. And he got a very dramatic effect. He\nmanaged to get high-grade people to do many awful things. But for years, it was in the psychology books as a demonstration of au-\nthority\u2014how authority could be used to persuade people to do awful things.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s mere first-conclusion bias. That\u2019s not the complete and correct explanation. Authority is part of it. However,\nthere were also quite a few other psychological principles, all operating in the same direction, that achieved that lollapalooza effect\n\nprecisely because they acted in combination toward the same end. People have gradually figured that out. And if you read the re-\n\f"}, "003892.png": {"text": "cent psychology texts at a place like Stanford, you'll see that they\u2019ve now managed to get it about two-thirds right. However, here\u2019s\nthe main experiment in all of psychology, and even at Stanford, they still leave out some of the important causes of Milgram\u2019s\nresults.\n\nHow can smart people be so wrong? Well, the answer is that they don\u2019t do what I\u2019m telling you to do\u2014which is to take all the\nmain models from psychology and use them as a checklist in reviewing outcomes in complex systems.\n\nNo pilot takes off without going through his checklist: A, B, C, D ... And no bridge player who needs two extra tricks plays a hand\nwithout going down his checklist and figuring out how to do it. But these psychology professors think they\u2019re so smart that they\ndon\u2019t need a checklist. But they aren\u2019t that smart. Almost nobody is. Or maybe nobody is. If they used a checklist, they\u2019d realize the\nMilgram experiment harnesses six psychological principles at least\u2014not three. All they\u2019d have to do is to go down the checklist to\nsee the ones that they missed. Similarly, without this system of getting the main models and using them together in a multi-mod-\nular way, you'll screw up time after time after time, too.\n\nOne reason psychology professors so screw up denial is that it\u2019s hard to do demonstrative experiments without conduct for-\nbidden by ethics. To demonstrate how misery creates mental dysfunction in people, think of what you'd have to do to your fellow\nhuman beings. And you'd have to do it without telling them about the injury to come. So clearly there are ethical reasons why it\u2019s\npractically impossible to do the experiments necessary to best lay out the ways human misery creates human mental misfunction.\n\nMost professors solve this problem, in effect, by assuming \u201cIf I can\u2019t demonstrate it with my experiments, then it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nHowever, obviously, that\u2019s asinine. If something is very important but can\u2019t be perfectly and precisely demonstrated because\nof ethical constraints, you can\u2019t just treat it like it doesn\u2019t exist. You have to do the best you can with it, with such evidence as is\navailable.\n\nPavlov himself spent the last 10 years of his life torturing dogs. And he published. Thus, we have a vast amount of data about\nmisery-caused mental misfunction in dogs and its correction. Yet it\u2019s in no introductory psychology book that you'll ever see. I\n\ndon\u2019t know whether they don\u2019t like the fact that Pavlov tortured dogs or whether B. F. Skinner, by overclaiming when he lapsed\n\f"}, "003893.png": {"text": "into his literary mode, made the drawing of implications from animal behavior into human behavior unpopular. However, for\nsome crazy reason or other, the psychology books are grossly inadequate in dealing with misery-caused mental misfunction.\n\nYou may say, \u201cWhat difference does all this psychological ignorance make?\u201d Well, if I\u2019m right, you need these models that are\nblanked out by this ignorance. And, furthermore, you need them in a form whereby if there are 20 constructs, you have all 20. In\nother words, you shouldn't be operating with 10. And you need to use them as a checklist. So you have to go back and put in your\nown head what I'd call the psychology of misjudgment in a form whereby you have all of the important models and you can use\nthem. And you especially need them when four or five forces from these models come together to operate in the same direction. In\nsuch cases, you often get lollapalooza effects\u2014which can make you rich, or they can kill you. So it\u2019s essential that you beware of lol-\nlapalooza effects.\n\nThere\u2019s only one right way to do it: You have to get the main doctrines together and use them as a checklist. And, to repeat for\n\nemphasis, you have to pay special attention to combinatorial effects that create lollapalooza consequences.\n\n[Charlie discusses the lack of multidisciplinary teaching in the professions, especially how the field of psychology is virtually ignored in\n\nacademia.]\n\nYou can also learn when you're playing the game of persuasion\u2014for a reputable reason\u2014to combine these forces in a way that\nmakes you more effective. Let me give you an example of that\u2014of wise psychology of yore. In Captain [James] Cook's day, he took\nthese long voyages. At the time, scurvy was the dread of the long voyage. In scurvy, your living gums putrefy in your mouth, after\nwhich the disease gets unpleasant and kills you. And being on a primitive sailing ship with a bunch of dying sailors is a very awk-\nward business.\n\nSo everybody was terribly interested in scurvy, but they didn\u2019t know about vitamin C. Well, Captain Cook, being a smart man\n\nwith a multiple-models kind of approach, noticed that Dutch ships had less scurvy than English ships on long voyages. So he said,\n\f"}, "003894.png": {"text": "\u201cwhat are the Dutch doing that\u2019s different?\u201d And he noticed they had all these barrels of sauerkraut. So he thought, \u201cI\u2019m going on\nthese long voyages, and it\u2019s very dangerous. Sauerkraut may help.\u201d So he laid in all this sauerkraut, which, incidentally, happens to\ncontain a trace of vitamin C.\n\nBut English sailors were a tough, cranky, and dangerous bunch in that day. They hated \u201ckrauts.\u201d And they were used to their\nstandard food and booze. So how do you get such English sailors to eat sauerkraut?\n\nWell, Cook didn\u2019t want to tell em that he was doing it in the hope it would prevent scurvy\u2014because they might mutiny and take\nover the ship if they thought that he was taking them on a voyage so long that scurvy was likely. So here\u2019s what he did: Officers ate\nat one place where the men could observe them. And for along time, he served sauerkraut to the officers but not to the men. And\nthen, finally, Captain Cook said, \u201cWell, the men can have it one day a week.\u201d In due course, he had the whole crew eating sauerkraut.\n\nI regard that as a very constructive use of elementary psychology. It may have saved God knows how many lives and caused God\n\nknows how much achievement. However, if you don\u2019t know the right techniques, you can\u2019t use them.\n\n[Charlie discusses psychological effects at play in the marketing of consumer items such as Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble products, Tup-\n\nperware, etc.]\n\nWorldly wisdom is mostly very, very simple. And what I\u2019m urging on you is not that hard to do if you have the will to plow\nthrough and do it. And the rewards are awesome\u2014absolutely awesome. But maybe you aren\u2019t interested in awesome rewards or\navoiding a lot of misery or being more able to serve everything you love in life. And if that\u2019s your attitude, then don\u2019t pay attention\nto what I\u2019ve been trying to tell you, because you're already on the right track.\n\nIt can\u2019t be emphasized too much that issues of morality are deeply entwined with worldly wisdom considerations involving\npsychology. For example, take the issue of stealing. A very significant fraction of the people in the world will steal if a) it\u2019s very\n\neasy to do and b) there\u2019s practically no chance of being caught. And once they start stealing, the consistency principle\u2014which is a\n\f"}, "003895.png": {"text": "big part of human psychology\u2014will soon combine with operant conditioning to make stealing habitual. So if you run a business\nwhere it\u2019s easy to steal because of your methods, you're working a great moral injury on the people who work for you.\n\nAgain, that\u2019s obvious. It\u2019s very, very important to create human systems that are hard to cheat. Otherwise, you're ruining your\ncivilization, because these big incentives will create incentive-caused bias and people will rationalize that bad behavior is okay.\nThen, if somebody else does it, now you've got at least two psychological principles: incentive-caused bias plus social proof. Not\nonly that but you get Serpico effects: If enough people are profiting in a general social climate of doing wrong, then they\u2019ll turn\non you and become dangerous enemies if you try and blow the whistle. It\u2019s very dangerous to ignore these principles and let slop\ncreep in. Powerful psychological forces are at work for evil.\n\nHow does this relate to the law business? Well, people graduate from places like Stanford Law School and go into the legislatures\nof our nation and, with the best of motives, pass laws that are easily used by people to cheat. Well, there could hardly be a worse\nthing you could do.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a desire to do public service. As a natural part of your planning, you think in reverse and ask, \u201cWhat can I do\nto ruin our civilization?\u201d That\u2019s easy. If what you want to do is to ruin your civilization, just go to the legislature and pass laws that\ncreate systems wherein people can easily cheat. It will work perfectly.\n\nTake the workers\u2019 compensation system in California. Stress is real. And its misery can be real. So you want to compensate peo-\nple for their stress in the workplace. It seems like a noble thing to do. But the trouble with such a compensation practice is that it\u2019s\npractically impossible to delete huge cheating. And once you reward cheating, you get crooked lawyers, crooked doctors, crooked\nunions, etc. participating in referral schemes. You get a total miasma of disastrous behavior. And the behavior makes all the people\ndoing it worse as they do it. So you were trying to help your civilization, but what you did was create enormous damage, net. So it\u2019s\nmuch better to let some things go uncompensated\u2014to let life be hard\u2014than to create systems that are easy to cheat.\n\nLet me give you an example: I have a friend who made an industrial product at a plant in Texas not far from the border. He\n\nwas in a low-margin, tough business. He got massive fraud in the workers\u2019 compensation system, to the point that his premiums\n\f"}, "003896.png": {"text": "reached double-digit percentages of payroll. And it was not that dangerous to produce his product. It\u2019s not like he was a demolition\ncontractor or something.\n\nSo he pleaded with the union, \u201cYou've got to stop this. There\u2019s not enough money in making this product to cover all of this\nfraud.\u201d But by then, everyone's used to it. \u201cIt\u2019s extra income. It\u2019s extra money. Everybody does it. It can\u2019t be that wrong. Eminent\nlawyers, eminent doctors, eminent chiropractors\u2014if there are any such things\u2014are cheating.\u201d\n\nAnd no one could tell them, \u201cYou can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d Incidentally, that\u2019s Pavlovian mere association, too. When people get\nbad news, they hate the messenger. Therefore, it was very hard for the union representative to tell all of these people that the easy\nmoney was about to stop. That is not the way to advance as a union representative.\n\nSo my friend closed his plant and moved the work to Utah among a community of believing Mormons. Well, the Mormons\naren\u2019t into workers\u2019 compensation fraud\u2014at least they aren\u2019t in my friend\u2019s plant. And guess what his workers\u2019 compensation ex-\npense is today? It\u2019s 2 percent of payroll.\n\nThis sort of tragedy is caused by letting the slop run. You must stop slop early. It\u2019s very hard to stop slop and moral failure if you\n\nJet it run for a while.\n\n[Charlie describes his notion of deprival-superreaction syndrome as it relates to gambling and the New Coke debacle of the mid-1980s.]\n\nOf course, as I said before, there is one big consideration that needs huge and special attention as part of any use of techniques\ndeliberately harnessing elementary psychological forces, and that is that once you know how to do it, there are real moral limits re-\ngarding how much you should do it. Not all of what you know how to do should you use to manipulate people.\n\nAlso, if you're willing to transcend the moral limits and the person you're trying to manipulate realizes what you're doing be-\ncause he also understands the psychology, he'll hate you. There is wonderfully persuasive evidence of this effect taken from labor\n\nrelations, some in Israel. So not only are there moral objections, but there are also practical objections\u2014big ones in some cases.\n\f"}, "003897.png": {"text": "Audience question: How do you incorporate psychology in your investment decisions? I think it would be more than just pick-\ning products that will appeal to everybody, like Coke. After all, there are a lot of smart people out there who obviously think\njust the way you showed us today. So are you looking for failure in the thinking of other investors when you go about picking\n\nsuccessful companies?\n\nWhat makes investment hard, as I said at USC, is that it\u2019s easy to see that some companies have better businesses than others. But\nthe price of the stock goes up so high that all of a sudden, the question of which stock is the best to buy gets quite difficult. We\u2019ve\nnever eliminated the difficulty of that problem. And 98 percent of the time, our attitude toward the market is that we're agnostics.\n\u2018We don\u2019t know. Is GM valued properly vis-a-vis Ford?

And it\u2019s true that some of the insight is\nstatistical in nature. However, again, we find only a few of those. It doesn\u2019t help us merely for favorable odds to exist. They have\nto be in a place where we can recognize them. So it takes a mispriced opportunity that we\u2019re smart enough to recognize. And that\n\ncombination doesn\u2019t occur often.

It was a preferred stock with a mandatory redemption. In\neffect, we were loaning money to USAir, and we had this equity kicker. We weren\u2019t guessing whether it would be a great place for\nthe shareholders. We were guessing whether it would remain prosperous enough to pay off a credit instrument, carrying a fixed\ndividend and a mandatory redemption. And we guessed that the business would not get so bad that we'd have a credit threat for\nwhich we were not being adequately compensated by the high rate we were getting.\n\nAs it happened, USAir went right to the brink of going broke.

And thereafter, the sec-\nond engineer came to me and said, \u201cCharlie, why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d Which is to his credit. It was a much better solution, both\nsafer and cheaper.\n\nYou must have the confidence to override people with more credentials than you whose cognition is impaired by incentive-\ncaused bias or some similar psychological force that is obviously present. But there are also cases where you have to recognize that\nyou have no wisdom to add and that your best course is to trust some expert. In effect, you\u2019ve got to know what you know and\n\nwhat you don\u2019t know. What could possibly be more useful in life than that?\nYou discussed Coke\u2019s mistake. Do you have any thoughts about where Apple\u201c went wrong?\n\nLet me give you a very good answer\u2014one I\u2019m copying from Jack Welch, the CEO of General Electric. He has a PhD in engineering.\nHe's a star businessman. He\u2019s a marvelous guy. And recently, in Warren\u2019s presence, someone asked him, \u201cJack, what did Apple do\nwrong?\u201d\n\nHis answer? \u201cI don\u2019t have any special competence that would enable me to answer that question.\u201d And I'll give you the very\nsame answer. That\u2019s not a field in which I\u2019m capable of giving you any special insight.\n\nOn the other hand, in copying Jack Welch, I am trying to teach you something. When you don\u2019t know and you don\u2019t have any\nspecial competence, don\u2019t be afraid to say so.\n\nThere\u2019s another type of person I compare to an example from biology: When a bee finds nectar, it comes back and does a little\ndance that tells the rest of the hive, as a matter of genetic programming, which direction to go and how far. So about 40 or 50 years\n\nago, some clever scientist stuck the nectar straight up. Well, the nectar\u2019s never straight up in the ordinary life of a bee. The nectar\u2019s\n\f"}, "003908.png": {"text": "out. So the bee finds the nectar and returns to the hive. But it doesn\u2019t have the genetic programming to do a dance that says straight\n\u2018up. So what does it do?\n\nWell, if it were like Jack Welch, it would just sit there. But what it actually does is to dance this incoherent dance that gums\nthings up. A lot of people are like that bee. They attempt to answer a question like that. And that is a huge mistake. Nobody expects\nyou to know everything about everything. I try to get rid of people who always confidently answer questions about which they\n\ndon\u2019t have any real knowledge. To me, they\u2019re like the bee dancing its incoherent dance. They\u2019re just screwing up the hive.\n\nAs someone who's been in legal practice and business, how did you incorporate, or did you incorporate, these models into\nyour legal practice? And how did it work? I suspect many of us have seen law firms that don\u2019t appear to adhere to these kinds\n\nof models.\n\n\u2018Well, the models are there. But just as there are perverse incentives in academia, there are perverse incentives in law firms. In fact,\nin some respects, at the law firms, it\u2019s much worse.\n\nHere\u2019s another model from law practice: When I was very young, my father practiced law. One of his best friends, Grant\nMcFayden, Omaha\u2019s Pioneer Ford dealer, was a client. He was a perfectly marvelous man, a self-made Irishman who'd run away\nuneducated from a farm as a youth because his father beat him. So he made his own way in the world. He was a brilliant man of\nenormous charm and integrity\u2014just a wonderful, wonderful man.\n\nIn contrast, my father had another client who was a blowhard, an overreaching, unfair, pompous, difficult man. And I must\nhave been 14 years old or thereabouts when I asked, \u201cDad, why do you do so much work for Mr. X, this overreaching blowhard, in-\nstead of working more for wonderful men like Grant McFayden?\u201d\n\nMy father said, \u201cGrant McFayden treats his employees right, his customers right, and his problems right. And if he gets involved\n\nwith a psychotic, he quickly walks over to where the psychotic is and works out an exit as fast as he can. Therefore, Grant McFay-\n\f"}, "003909.png": {"text": "den doesn\u2019t have enough remunerative law business to keep you in Coca-Cola. But Mr. X is a walking minefield of wonderful legal\nbusiness.\u201d\n\nThis case demonstrates one of the troubles with practicing law. To a considerable extent, you're going to be dealing with grossly\ndefective people. They create an enormous amount of the remunerative law business. And even when your own client is a paragon\nof virtue, you'll often be dealing with gross defectives on the other side or even on the bench. That\u2019s partly what drove me out of\nthe profession. The rest was my own greed, but my success in serving greed partly allowed me to make easier the process of being\nhonorable and sensible. Like Ben Franklin observed, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for an empty sack to stand upright.\u201d\n\nTd argue that my father\u2019s model when I asked him about the two clients was totally correct didaction. He taught me the right\nlesson. The lesson? As you go through life, sell your services once in a while to an unreasonable blowhard if that\u2019s what you must\ndo to feed your family. But run your own life like Grant McFayden.\n\nThat was a great lesson. And he taught it in a very clever way\u2014because instead of just pounding it in, he told it to me in a way\nthat required a slight mental reach. I had to make the reach myself in order to get the idea that I should behave like Grant McFay-\nden. And because I had to reach for it, he figured I'd hold it better. And, indeed, I\u2019ve held it all the way through until today, through\nall of these decades. That\u2019s a very clever teaching method.\n\nThere, again, we're talking about elementary psychology. It\u2019s elementary literature. Good literature makes the reader reach a\nlittle for understanding. Then it works better. You hold it better. It\u2019s the commitment and consistency tendency. If you\u2019ve reached\nfor it, the idea\u2019s pounded in better.\n\nAsa lawyer or executive, you'll want to teach somebody what my father taught me, or maybe you'll want to teach them some-\nthing else. And you can use lessons like this. Isn\u2019t that a great way to teach a child? My father used indirection on purpose. And look\nat how powerfully it worked\u2014like Captain Cook\u2019s wise use of psychology. I\u2019ve been trying to imitate Grant McFayden ever since, for\n\nall my life. I may have had a few lapses. But at least I\u2019ve been trying.\n\f"}, "003910.png": {"text": "At the end of your article in OID, you mentioned that only a select few investment managers actually add value. Since you're\n\nspeaking to an audience of future lawyers, what would you encourage us to do in order to be able to add value in our profes-\n\nsion?\n\nTo the extent you become a person who thinks correctly, you can add great value. To the extent you've learned it so well that you\nhave enough confidence to intervene where it takes a little courage, you can add great value. And to the extent that you can prevent\nor stop some asininity that would otherwise destroy your firm, your client, or something that you care about, you can add great\nvalue.\n\nThere are constructive tricks you can use. For example, one reason why my old classmate Joe Flom of Skadden, Arps has been\nsuch a successful lawyer is that he\u2019s very good at dreaming up little vivid examples that serve to pound the point home in a way\nthat really works. It\u2019s enormously helpful when you're serving clients or otherwise trying to persuade someone in a good cause to\ncome up with a little humorous example. The ability to do that is a knack. So you could argue that the Joe Floms of the world are\nalmost born with a gift. But he\u2019s honed the gift. And to one degree or another, all of you were born with the gift, and you can hone\nit too.\n\nOccasionally, you get into borderline stuff. For instance, suppose you've got a client who really wants to commit tax fraud. If he\ndoesn\u2019t push the tax law way beyond the line, he can\u2019t stand it. He can\u2019t shave in the morning if he thinks there\u2019s been any cheating\nhe could get by with that he hasn\u2019t done. And there are people like that. They just feel they aren\u2019t living aggressively enough.\n\nYou can approach that situation in either of two ways: You can say, \u201cI just won\u2019t work for him,\u201d and duck it. Or you can say,\n\u201cWell, the circumstances of my life require that I work for him. And what I\u2019m doing for him doesn\u2019t involve my cheating. There-\nfore, I'll do it.\u201d And if you see he wants to do something really stupid, it probably won\u2019t work to tell him, \u201cWhat you're doing is bad.\nIhave better morals than you.\u201d That offends him. You're young. He\u2019s old. Therefore, instead of being persuaded, he\u2019s more likely to\nreact with \u201cWho in the hell are you to establish the moral code of the whole world?\u201d But instead, you can say to him, \u201cYou can\u2019t do\n\nthat without three other people beneath you knowing about it. Therefore, you\u2019re making yourself subject to blackmail. You're risk-\n\f"}, "003911.png": {"text": "ing your reputation. You're risking your family, your money,\u201d etc. That is likely to work. And you're telling him something that\u2019s\ntrue.\n\nDo you want to spend a lot of time working for people where you have to use methods like that to get them to behave well? I\nthink the answer is no. But if you\u2019re hooked with it, appealing to his interest is likely to work better as a matter of human persua-\nsion than appealing to anything else. That, again, is a powerful psychological principle with deep biological roots.\n\nI saw that psychological principle totally blown at Salomon. Salomon\u2019s general counsel knew that the CEO, [John] Gutfreund,~\nshould have promptly told the federal authorities all about Salomon\u2019s trading improprieties, in which Gutfreund didn\u2019t participate\nand which he hadn't caused. And the general counsel urged Gutfreund to do it. He told Gutfreund, in effect, \u201cYou\u2019re probably not\nlegally required to do that, but it\u2019s the right thing to do. You really should.\u201d But it didn\u2019t work. The task was easy to put off because\nit was unpleasant. So that\u2019s what Gutfreund did\u2014he put it off.\n\nThe general counsel had very little constituency within Salomon except for the CEO. If the CEO went down, the general counsel\nwas going down with him. Therefore, his whole career was on the line. So to save his career, he needed to talk the dilatory CEO into\ndoing the right thing.\n\nIt would\u2019ve been child\u2019s play to get that job done right. All the general counsel had to do was to tell his boss, \u201cJohn, this situation\ncould ruin your life. You could lose your wealth. You could lose your reputation.\u201d And it would have worked. CEOs don\u2019t like the\nidea of being ruined, disgraced, and fired.\n\nThe ex-general counsel of Salomon is brilliant and generous, and he had the right idea. However, he lost his job because he\ndidn\u2019t apply a little elementary psychology. He failed to recognize that what works best in most cases is to appeal to a man\u2019s inter-\nest. But you don\u2019t have to get similarly lousy results when you face similar situations. Just remember what happened to Gutfreund\nand his general counsel. The right lessons are easily learned if you'll work at it. And if you do learn them, you can be especially\nuseful at crucial moments when others fail. And to the extent that you do become wise, diligent, objective, and especially able to\n\npersuade in a good cause, then you're adding value.\n\f"}, "003912.png": {"text": "Would you discuss how the threat of litigation\u2014shareholder lawsuits and so forth\u2014and legal complexity in general have\n\naffected decision-making in big business?\n\nWell, every big business screams about its legal costs, screams about the amount of regulation, screams about the complexity of\nits life, screams about the plaintiffs\u2019 bar, particularly the class-action plaintiffs\u2019 bar. So there\u2019s an absolute catechism on that where\nyou could just copy the screams from one corporation to another and you'd hardly have to change a word.\n\nBut what causes the screams has, so far, been a godsend for the law firms. The big law firms have had a long updraft. And they\nnow tend to kind of cluck like an undertaker in a plague. An undertaker, of course, would look very unseemly if he were jumping\nup and down and playing his fiddle during the plague. So law firm partners say, \u201cOh, isn\u2019t it sad\u2014all this complexity, all this litiga-\ntion, all this unfairness.\u201d\n\nBut, really, they\u2019re somewhat schizophrenic on the subject because it\u2019s been very good for them. Some recent California initia-\ntives created some interesting conduct. Part of the defense bar lobbied quietly against certain propositions and, effectively, against\ntheir clients because they didn\u2019t want their clients to catch em in the process. And the reason they did so was because it became\nharder for plaintiffs to bring cases. If you make a living fighting overreaching and it keeps your children in school and somebody\nproposes a system that eliminates it\u2014well, that\u2019s an adult experience and an adult choice that you have to make.\n\nSo big corporations adapt. They have more litigation. They have to have a bigger legal department. They scream about what\n\nthey don\u2019t like. But they adapt.\n\nBut hasn't that legal complexity consumed a lot more of companies\u2019 resources over the last few decades?\n\f"}, "003913.png": {"text": "The answer is yes. There\u2019s hardly a corporation in America that isn\u2019t spending more on lawsuits and on compliance with various\nregulations than it was 20 years ago. And yes, some of the new regulation is stupid and foolish. And some was damn well neces-\n\nsary. And it will ever be thus, albeit with some ebb and flow.\n\nBut have you seen or experienced any change in decision-making at corporations in their being less likely to take on riskier\n\ninvestments for fear of failure or liability?\n\nThe only place I saw\u2014with another friend, not Warren\u2014was when I was part owner of the biggest shareholder in a company that\ninvented a better policeman\u2019s helmet. It was made of Kevlar or something of that sort. They brought it to us and wanted us to man-\nufacture it.\n\nAsa matter of ideology, we\u2019re very pro-police. I believe civilization needs a police force\u2014although I don\u2019t believe in policemen\ncreating too many widows and orphans unnecessarily either. But we like the idea of a better policeman\u2019s helmet. However, we took\none look at it and said to the people who invented it, \u201cWe're a rich corporation. We can\u2019t afford to make a better policeman\u2019s helmet.\nThat\u2019s just how the civilization works. All risks considered, it can\u2019t work for us. But we want the civilization to have these. So we\ndon\u2019t maximize what we sell it for. Get somebody else to make it. Transfer the technology or whatever to somebody who can do it.\nBut we're not going to.\u201d Thus, we didn\u2019t try to disadvantage policemen from getting new helmets, but we decided not to manufac-\nture helmets ourselves.\n\nThere are businesses\u2014given the way the civilization has developed\u2014where being the only deep pocket around is bad business.\nIn high school football, for example, a paraplegic or a quadriplegic will inevitably be created occasionally. And who with deep pock-\nets can the injured person best sue other than the helmet manufacturer? Then everyone feels sorry, the injuries are horrible, and\nthe case is dangerous for the manufacturer. I think big, rich corporations are seldom wise to make football helmets in the kind of a\n\ncivilization we're in. And maybe it should be harder to successfully sue helmet makers.\n\f"}, "003914.png": {"text": "I know two different doctors, each of whom had a sound marriage. When the malpractice premiums got high enough, they di-\nvorced their wives and transferred most of their property to their wives. And they continued to practice, only without malpractice\ninsurance.

People adapt to a changing litigation climate. They have various ways of doing it.\nThat\u2019s how it\u2019s always been and how it\u2019s always going to be.\n\nWhat I personally hate most are systems that make fraud easy. Probably way more than half of all the chiropractic income in\nCalifornia comes from pure fraud. For example, I have a friend who had a little fender bender, an auto accident, in a tough neigh-\nborhood. And he got two chiropractors\u2019 cards and one lawyer\u2019s card before he\u2019d even left the intersection. They\u2019re in the business of\nmanufacturing claims that necks hurt.\n\nIn California, I believe the Rand statistics showed that we have twice as many personal injuries per accident as in many other\nstates. And we aren\u2019t getting twice as much real injury per accident. So the other half of that is fraud. People just get so that they\nthink everybody does it and it\u2019s all right to do. I think it\u2019s terrible to let that stuff creep in.\n\nIf I were running the civilization, compensation for stress in workers\u2019 comp would be zero\u2014not because there\u2019s no work-caused\nstress, but because I think the net social damage of allowing stress to be compensated at all is worse than what would happen ifa\nfew people who had real work-caused stress injuries went uncompensated.\n\nIlike the Navy system. If you're a captain in the Navy and you've been up for 24 hours straight and have to go to sleep, and you\nturn the ship over to a competent first mate in tough conditions and he takes the ship aground, clearly through no fault of yours,\nthey don\u2019t court-martial you, but your naval career is over.\n\nYou can say, \u201cThat\u2019s too tough. That\u2019s not law school. That\u2019s not due process.\u201d Well, the Navy model is better in its context than\nwould be the law school model. The Navy model really forces people to pay attention when conditions are tough, because they\nknow that there\u2019s no excuse. Napoleon*= said he liked luckier generals\u2014he wasn\u2019t into supporting losers. Well, the Navy likes luck-\nier captains. It doesn\u2019t matter why your ship goes aground, your career is over.

You overestimate the difficulty.

The right way to do it would be in a book.\n\f"}, "003919.png": {"text": "Thope what I\u2019m saying will help you be more effective and better human beings.

And not only let me get rich faster, but teach me faster, too.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t have much interest in writing a book myself. Plus, it would be a lot of work for somebody like me to try and do it in my\n70s. And I have plenty else to do in life. So I\u2019m not going to do it. But it\u2019s a screaming opportunity for somebody. I'd provide funds to\nsupport the writing of an appropriate book if I found someone with the wisdom and the will to do the job right.\n\nLet me turn to some of the probable reasons for present bad education. Part of the trouble is caused by the balkanization of\nacademia. For instance, psychology is most powerful when combined with doctrines from other academic departments. But if\nyour psychology professor doesn\u2019t know the other doctrines, then he isn\u2019t capable of doing the necessary integration. And how\nwould anyone get to be a psychology professor in the first place if he were good with non-psychology doctrines and constantly\nworked non-psychology doctrines into his material? Such a would-be professor would usually offend his peers and superiors.\n\nThere have been some fabulous psychology professors in the history of the world. [Robert] Cialdini of Arizona State was very\nuseful to me, as was B. F. Skinner\u2014for his experimental results, if divorced from his monomania and utopianism. But averaged\nout, I don\u2019t believe that psychology professors in America are people whose alternative career paths were in the toughest part of\nphysics. And that may be one of the reasons why they don\u2019t get it quite right.\n\nThe schools of education, even at eminent universities, are pervaded by psychology. And they\u2019re almost an intellectual disgrace.\nIt\u2019s not unheard of for academic departments, even at great institutions, to be quite deficient in important ways. And including a\nlot of material labeled as psychological is no cure-all. And given academic inertia, all academic deficiencies are very hard to fix.\n\nDo you know how they tried to fix psychology at the University of Chicago? Having tenured professors who were terrible, the\npresident there actually abolished the entire psychology department. And Chicago, in due course, will probably bring back anew\nand different psychology department. Indeed, by now, it probably has. Perhaps conditions are now better. And I must admit that I\n\nadmire a college president who will do something like that.\n\f"}, "003920.png": {"text": "Ido not wish to imply in my criticism that the imperfections of academic psychology teaching are all attributable to some\nkind of human fault common only to such departments. Instead, the causes of many of the imperfections lie deep in the nature of\nthings\u2014in irritating peculiarities that can\u2019t be removed from psychology.\n\nLet me demonstrate by a thought experiment involving a couple of questions. Are there not many fields that need a synthesiz-\ning supermind like that of James Clerk Maxwell but are destined never to attract one? And is academic psychology, by its nature,\none of the most unfortunate of all the would-be attractors of superminds? I think the answers are yes and yes.\n\nOne can see this by considering the case of any of the few members of each generation who can, as fast as fingers can move,\naccurately work through the problem sets in thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and physical chemistry. Such a person will be\nbegged by some of the most eminent people alive to enter the upper reaches of hard science.\n\nWill such a super-gifted person instead choose academic psychology, wherein lie very awkward realities: a) that the tendencies\ndemonstrated by social psychology paradoxically grow weaker as more people learn them, and b) that clinical (patient-treating)\npsychology has to deal with the awkward reality that happiness, physiologically measured, is often improved by believing things\nthat are not true? The answer, I think, is plainly no. The supermind will be repelled by academic psychology, much as Nobel laure-\n\nate physicist Max Planck was repelled by economics, wherein he saw problems that wouldn't yield to his methods.\n\nWe talk a lot about trade-offs between the quality of our life and our professional commitments. Is there time for a profes-\nsional life, learning about these models, and doing whatever else interests you? Do you find time to do fun things besides\n\nlearning?\n\nI\u2019ve always taken a fair amount of time to do what I really wanted to do, some of which was merely to fish or play bridge or play\n\ngolf.\n\f"}, "003921.png": {"text": "Each of us must figure out his or her own lifestyle.

Since then, political animosity has increased greatly, both on the left and the right, with sad\neffects on the ability of people to recognize reality, exactly as I would have expected.\n\nNaturally, I don\u2019t like this result. The grain of my emotional nature is to respond as Archimedes might respond if he com-\nplained now to God, \u201cHow could you put in those Dark Ages after I published my formulas?\u201d Or as Mark Twain once complained,\n\n\u201cThese are sad days in literature. Homer is dead. Shakespeare is dead. And I myself am not feeling at all well.\u201d\n\f"}, "003923.png": {"text": "Fortunately, I am still able to refrain from complaint in the mode of Mark Twain. After all, I never had more than a shred of an\nillusion that any views of mine would much change the world.

Instead, what works best for me in coping with all disappointment is what I call the Jewish method: humor.\n\nAs I revisit Talk Three in March 2006, I still like its emphasis on the desirability of making human systems as cheating-proof as\nis practicable, even if this leaves some human misery unfixed. After all, the people who rewarded cheating on a massive scale leave\na trail of super-ruin in their wake, since the bad conduct spreads by example and is so very hard to reverse.\n\nAnd I fondly recall Talk Three\u2019s emphasis on both the life-handling lessons I learned from my father\u2019s friend, Grant McFayden,\nand one teaching method I learned from my father.

For this problem, he has other solutions.\n\nThis talk was delivered in 1996 to a group that has a policy of not publicizing its programs.\n\f"}, "003925.png": {"text": "Editor's warning, as suggested by Charlie: Most people don\u2019t understand this talk. Charlie says it was an extreme\ncommunication failure when made, and people have since found it difficult to understand even when read slowly,\n\ntwice. To Charlie, these outcomes have \u201cprofound educational implications.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe title of my talk is \u201cPractical Thought about Practical Thought?,\u201d with a question mark at the end. In a long career, I have assim-\nilated various ultrasimple general notions that I find helpful in solving problems. Five of these helpful notions I will now describe.\nAfter that, I will present to you a problem of extreme scale. Indeed, the problem will involve turning startup capital of $2 million\ninto $2 trillion, a sum large enough to represent a practical achievement. Then, I will try to solve the problem, assisted by my help-\nful general notions. Following that, I will suggest that there are important educational implications in my demonstration. I will so\nfinish because my objective is educational, my game today being a search for better methods of thought.\n\nThe first helpful notion is that it is usually best to simplify problems by deciding big no-brainer questions first.\n\nThe second helpful notion mimics Galileo's\u2019 conclusion that scientific reality is often revealed only by math as if math was the\nlanguage of God. Galileo\u2019s attitude also works well in messy, practical life. Without numerical fluency, in the part of life most of us\ninhabit, you are like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.\n\nThe third helpful notion is that it is not enough to think problems through forward. You must also think in reverse, much like\nthe rustic who wanted to know where he was going to die so that he\u2019d never go there. Indeed, many problems can\u2019t be solved for-\nward. And that is why the great algebraist Carl Jacobi so often said, \u201cInvert, always invert,\u201d and why the Pythagoreans~ thought in\nreverse to prove that the square root of two was an irrational number.\n\nThe fourth helpful notion is that the best and most practical wisdom is elementary academic wisdom. But there is one\n\nextremely important qualification: You must think in a multidisciplinary manner. You must routinely use all the easy-to-learn\n\f"}, "003926.png": {"text": "concepts from the freshman course in every basic subject. Where elementary ideas will serve, your problem-solving must not be\nlimited, as academia and many business bureaucracies are limited, by extreme balkanization into disciplines and subdisciplines,\nwith strong taboos against any venture outside assigned territory. Instead, you must do your multidisciplinary thinking in accord\nwith Ben Franklin\u2019s prescription in Poor Richard: \u201cIf you want it done, go. If not, send.\u201d\n\nIf, in your thinking, you rely entirely on others\u2014often through purchase of professional advice\u2014whenever outside a small\nterritory of your own, you will suffer much calamity. And it is not just difficulties in complex coordination that will do you in. You\nwill also suffer from the reality evoked by the Shavian character who said, \u201cIn the last analysis, every profession is a conspiracy\nagainst the laity.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a Shavian character, for once, understated the horrors of something [George Bernard] Shaw didn\u2019t like. It is not usually\nthe conscious malfeasance of your narrow professional adviser that does you in. Instead, your troubles come from his subcon-\nscious bias. His cognition will often be impaired, for your purposes, by financial incentives different from yours. And he will also\nsuffer from the psychological defect caught by the proverb \u201cTo a man with a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.\u201d\n\nThe fifth helpful notion is that really big effects, lollapalooza effects, will often come only from large combinations of factors.\nFor instance, tuberculosis was tamed, at least for along time, only by routine, combined use in each case of three different drugs.\nAnd other lollapalooza effects, like the flight of an airplane, follow a similar pattern.\n\nIt is now time to present my practical problem. And here is the problem:\n\nItis 1884 in Atlanta. You are brought, along with 20 others like you, before a rich and eccentric Atlanta citizen named Glotz.\nBoth you and Glotz share two characteristics: First, you routinely use in problem-solving the five helpful notions, and second, you\nknow all the elementary ideas in all the basic college courses, as taught in 1996. However, all discoverers and all examples demon-\nstrating these elementary ideas come from dates before 1884. Neither you nor Glotz knows anything about anything that has hap-\n\npened after 1884.\n\f"}, "003927.png": {"text": "Glotz offers to invest $2 million in 1884 dollars, yet take only half the equity, for a Glotz Charitable Foundation, in a new cor-\nporation organized to go into the non-alcoholic beverage business and remain in that business only, forever. Glotz wants to use a\nname that has somehow charmed him: Coca-Cola.\n\nThe other half of the new corporation\u2019s equity will go to the man who most plausibly demonstrates that his business plan will\ncause Glotz\u2019s foundation to be worth a trillion dollars 150 years later, in the money of that later time, 2034, despite paying out a\nlarge part of its earnings each year as a dividend. This will make the whole new corporation worth $2 trillion, even after paying out\nmany billions of dollars in dividends.\n\nYou have 15 minutes to make your pitch. What do you say to Glotz?\n\nHere is my solution, my pitch to Glotz, using only the helpful notions and what every bright college sophomore should know:\nWell, Glotz, the big no-brainer decisions that, to simplify our problem, should be made first are as follows: First, we are never\ngoing to create something worth $2 trillion by selling some generic beverage. Therefore, we must make your name, Coca-Cola, into\n\na strong, legally protected trademark. Second, we can get to $2 trillion only by starting in Atlanta, then succeeding in the rest of\nthe United States, then rapidly succeeding with our new beverage all over the world. This will require developing a product that\nhas universal appeal because it harnesses powerful elemental forces. And the right place to find such powerful elemental forces is\nin the subject matter of elementary academic courses.\n\nWe will next use numerical fluency to ascertain what our target implies. We can guess reasonably that by 2034 there will be\nabout 8 billion beverage consumers in the world. On average, each of these consumers will be much more prosperous in real terms\nthan the average consumer of 1884. Each consumer is composed mostly of water and must ingest about 64 ounces of water per\nday. This is eight 8-ounce servings. Thus, if our new beverage, and other imitative beverages in our new market, can flavor and\notherwise improve only 25 percent of ingested water worldwide, and we can occupy half of the new world market, we can sell 2.92\ntrillion 8-ounce servings in 2034. And if we can then net 4\u00a2 per serving, we will earn $117 billion. This will be enough, if our busi-\n\nness is still growing at a good rate, to make it easily worth $2 trillion.\n\f"}, "003928.png": {"text": "A big question, of course, is whether 4\u00a2 per serving is a reasonable profit target for 2034. And the answer is yes if we can create\na beverage with strong universal appeal. One hundred and fifty years is a long time. The dollar, like the Roman drachma,~ will\nalmost surely suffer monetary depreciation. Concurrently, real purchasing power of the average beverage consumer in the world\nwill go way up. His proclivity to inexpensively improve his experience while ingesting water will go up considerably faster. Mean-\nwhile, as technology improves, the cost of our simple product, in units of constant purchasing power, will go down. All four factors\nwill work together in favor of our 4\u00a2 per-serving profit target. Worldwide beverage purchasing power in dollars will probably mul-\ntiply by a factor of at least 40 over 150 years. Thinking in reverse, this makes our profit per-serving target, under 1884 conditions,\na mere one-fortieth of 4\u00a2 or one-tenth of a cent per serving. This is an easy-to-exceed target as we start out if our new product has\nuniversal appeal.\n\nThat decided, we must next solve the problem of invention to create universal appeal. There are two intertwined challenges\nof large scale. First, over 150 years, we must cause a new-beverage market to assimilate about one-fourth of the world\u2019s water\ningestion. Second, we must so operate that half the new market is ours while all our competitors combined are left to share the re-\nmaining half. These results are lollapalooza results. Accordingly, we must attack our problem by causing every favorable factor we\ncan think of to work for us. Plainly, only a powerful combination of many factors is likely to cause the lollapalooza consequences\nwe desire. Fortunately, the solution to these intertwined problems turns out to be fairly easy if one has stayed awake in all the\nfreshman courses.\n\nLet us start by exploring the consequences of our simplifying no-brainer decision that we must rely on a strong trademark. This\nconclusion automatically leads to an understanding of the essence of our business in proper elementary academic terms. We can\nsee from the introductory course in psychology that, in essence, we are going into the business of creating and maintaining con-\nditioned reflexes. The Coca-Cola trade name and trade dress will act as the stimuli, and the purchase and ingestion of our beverage\nwill be the desired responses.\n\nAnd how does one create and maintain conditioned reflexes? Well, the psychology text gives two answers: 1) by operant\n\nconditioning and 2) by classical conditioning, often called Pavlovian conditioning to honor the great Russian scientist. And since\n\f"}, "003929.png": {"text": "we want a lollapalooza result, we must use both conditioning techniques, and all we can invent to enhance effects from each\ntechnique.\n\nThe operant conditioning part of our problem is easy to solve. We need only 1) maximize rewards of our beverage\u2019s ingestion\nand 2) minimize possibilities that desired reflexes, once created by us, will be extinguished through operant conditioning by pro-\nprietors of competing products.\n\nFor operant conditioning rewards, there are only a few categories we will find practical:\n\n1. Food value in calories or other inputs\n\n2. Flavor, texture, and aroma acting as stimuli to consumption under neural preprogramming of man through Darwinian natu-\nral selection\n\n3. Stimulus, as by sugar or caffeine\n\n4. Cooling effect when man is too hot or warming effect when man is too cool\n\nWanting a lollapalooza result, we will naturally include rewards in all the categories.\n\nTo start out, it is easy to decide to design our beverage for consumption cold. There is much less opportunity, without ingesting\na beverage, to counteract excessive heat compared with excessive cold. Moreover, with excessive heat, much liquid must be con-\nsumed, and the reverse is not true.\n\nIt is also easy to decide to include both sugar and caffeine. After all, tea, coffee, and lemonade are already widely consumed. And\nit is also clear that we must be fanatic about determining, through trial and error, flavor and other characteristics that will maxi-\nmize human pleasure while taking in the sugared water and caffeine we will provide.\n\nAnd, to counteract possibilities that desired operant-conditioned reflexes, once created by us, will be extinguished by operant-\n\nconditioning-employing competing products, there is also an obvious answer: We will make it a permanent obsession in our com-\n\f"}, "003930.png": {"text": "pany that our beverage, as fast as practicable, will at all times be available everywhere throughout the world. After all, a competing\nproduct, if it is never tried, can\u2019t act as a reward creating a conflicting habit. Every spouse knows that.\n\nWe must next consider the Pavlovian conditioning we must also use. In Pavlovian conditioning, powerful effects come from\nmere association. The neural system of Pavlov\u2019s dog causes it to salivate at the bell it can\u2019t eat. And the brain of man yearns for the\ntype of beverage held by the pretty woman he can\u2019t have. And so, Glotz, we must use every sort of decent, honorable Pavlovian con-\nditioning we can think of. For as long as we are in business, our beverage and its promotion must be associated in consumer minds\nwith all other things consumers like or admire.\n\nSuch extensive Pavlovian conditioning will cost a lot of money, particularly for advertising. We will spend big money as far\nahead as we can imagine. But the money will be effectively spent. As we expand fast in our new-beverage market, our competitors\nwill face gross disadvantages of scale in buying advertising to create the Pavlovian conditioning they need. And this outcome,\nalong with other volume-creates-power effects, should help us gain and hold at least 50 percent of the new market everywhere. In-\ndeed, provided buyers are scattered, our higher volumes will give us very extreme cost advantages in distribution.\n\nMoreover, Pavlovian effects from mere association will help us choose the flavor, texture, and color of our new beverage. Con-\nsidering Pavlovian effects, we will have wisely chosen the exotic and expensive-sounding name \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d instead of a pedestrian\nname like \u201cGlotz\u2019s Sugared, Caffeinated Water.\u201d For similar Pavlovian reasons, it will be wise to have our beverage look pretty much\nlike wine instead of sugared water. So we will artificially color our beverage if it comes out clear. And we will carbonate our water,\nmaking our product seem like champagne, or some other expensive beverage, while also making its flavor better and imitation\nharder to arrange for competing products. And, because we are going to attach so many expensive psychological effects to our\nflavor, that flavor should be different from any other standard flavor so that we maximize difficulties for competitors and give no\naccidental same-flavor benefit to any existing product.\n\nWhat else from the psychology textbook can help our new business? Well, there is that powerful \u201cmonkey see, monkey do\u201d\naspect of human nature that psychologists often call social proof. Social proof\u2014imitative consumption triggered by mere sight of\n\nconsumption\u2014will not only help induce trial of our beverage, it will also bolster perceived rewards from consumption. We will\n\f"}, "003931.png": {"text": "always take this powerful social proof factor into account as we design advertising and sales promotion and as we forego present\nprofit to enhance present and future consumption. More than with most other products, increased selling power will come from.\neach increase in sales.\n\nWe can now see, Glotz, that by combining 1) much Pavlovian conditioning, 2) powerful social proof effects, and 3) a wonderful-\ntasting, energy-giving, stimulating, and desirably cold beverage that causes much operant conditioning, we are going to get sales\nthat speed up for a long time by reason of the huge mixture of factors we have chosen. Therefore, we are going to start something\nlike an autocatalytic reaction in chemistry\u2014precisely the sort of multifactor-triggered lollapalooza effect we need.\n\nThe logistics and the distribution strategy of our business will be simple. There are only two practical ways to sell our beverage:\n1) as syrup to fountains and restaurants and 2) as a complete carbonated water product in containers. Wanting lollapalooza re-\nsults, we will naturally do it both ways. And, wanting huge Pavlovian and social proof effects, we will always spend on advertising\nand sales promotion, per serving, over 40 percent of the fountain price for syrup needed to make the serving.\n\nA few syrup-making plants can serve the world. However, to avoid needless shipping of mere space and water, we will need\nmany bottling plants scattered over the world. We will maximize profits if, like early General Electric with light bulbs, we always\nset the first-sale price, either 1) for fountain syrup or 2) for any container of our complete product. The best way to arrange this\ndesirable profit-maximizing control is to make any independent bottler we need a subcontractor, not a vendee of syrup, and cer-\ntainly not a vendee of syrup under a perpetual franchise specifying a syrup price frozen forever at its starting level.\n\nBeing unable to get a patent or copyright on our super-important flavor, we will work obsessively to keep our formula secret.\nWe will make a big hoopla over our secrecy, which will enhance Pavlovian effects. Eventually, food chemical engineering will ad-\nvance so that our flavor can be copied with near exactitude. But by that time, we will be so far ahead, with such strong trademarks\nand complete, \u201calways available\u201d worldwide distribution, that good flavor copying won't bar us from our objective. Moreover, the\nadvances in food chemistry that help competitors will almost surely be accompanied by technological advances that will help us,\nincluding refrigeration, better transportation, and, for dieters, the ability to insert a sugar taste without inserting sugar\u2019s calories.\n\nAlso, there will be related beverage opportunities we will seize.\n\f"}, "003932.png": {"text": "This brings us to a final reality check for our business plan. We will, once more, think in reverse like Jacobi. What must we avoid\nbecause we don\u2019t want it? Four answers seem clear:\n\nFirst, we must avoid the protective, cloying, stop-consumption effects of aftertaste that are a standard part of physiology,\ndeveloped through Darwinian evolution to enhance the replication of man\u2019s genes by forcing a generally helpful moderation on\nthe gene carrier. To serve our ends, on hot days, a consumer must be able to drink container after container of our product with\nalmost no impediment from aftertaste. We will find a wonderful no-aftertaste flavor by trial and error and will thereby solve this\nproblem.\n\nSecond, we must avoid ever losing even half of our powerful trademarked name. It will cost us mightily, for instance, if our\nsloppiness should ever allow the sale of any other kind of \u201ccola,\u201d for instance a \u201cPeppy Cola.\u201d If there is ever a Peppy Cola, we will be\nthe proprietor of the brand.\n\nThird, with so much success coming, we must avoid bad effects from envy, which is given a prominent place in the Ten Com-\nmandments because envy is so much a part of human nature. The best way to avoid envy, as recognized by Aristotle; * is to plainly\ndeserve the success we get. We will be fanatic about product quality, quality of product presentation, and reasonableness of prices,\nconsidering the harmless pleasure we will provide.\n\nFourth, after our trademarked flavor dominates our new market, we must avoid making any huge and sudden change in our\nflavor. Even if a new flavor performs better in blind taste tests, changing to that new flavor would be a foolish thing to do.

I think it would have won with Glotz in 1884 and should convince you more than you expected at the outset. After all,\nthe correct strategies are clear after being related to elementary academic ideas brought into play by the helpful notions.\n\nHow consistent is my solution with the history of the real Coca-Cola Company? Well, as late as 1896, 12 years after the fictional\nGlotz was to start vigorously with $2 million in 1884 dollars, the real Coca-Cola Company had a net worth under $150,000 and\nearnings of about zero. And thereafter, the real Coca-Cola Company did lose half its trademark and did grant perpetual bottling\nfranchises at fixed syrup prices. And some of the bottlers were not very effective and couldn't easily be changed. And the real Coca-\nCola Company, with this system, did lose much pricing control that would have improved results, had it been retained.\n\nYet, even so, the real Coca-Cola Company followed so much of the plan given to Glotz that it is now worth about $125 billion and\nwill have to increase its value at only 8 percent per year until 2034 to reach a value of $2 trillion. And it can hit an annual physical\nvolume target of 2.92 trillion servings if servings grow until 2034 at only 6 percent per year, a result consistent with much past\nexperience and leaving plenty of plain-water ingestion for Coca-Cola to replace after 2034. SoI would guess that the fictional Glotz,\nstarting earlier and stronger and avoiding the worst errors, would have easily hit his $2 trillion target. And he would have done it\nwell before 2034.\n\nThis brings me, at last, to the main purpose of my talk. Large educational implications exist, if my answer to Glotz\u2019s problem\nis roughly right and if you make one more assumption I believe true\u2014that most PhD educators, even psychology professors and\nbusiness school deans, would not have given the same simple answer I did. And if I am right in these two ways, this would indicate\nthat our civilization now keeps in place a great many educators who can\u2019t satisfactorily explain Coca-Cola, even in retrospect, and\neven after watching it closely all their lives. This is not a satisfactory state of affairs.\n\nMoreover\u2014and this result is even more extreme\u2014the brilliant and effective executives who, surrounded by business school and\nlaw school graduates, have run the Coca-Cola Company with glorious success in recent years also did not understand elementary\n\npsychology well enough to predict and avoid the New Coke fiasco, which dangerously threatened their company. That people so\n\f"}, "003934.png": {"text": "talented, surrounded by professional advisers from the best universities, should thus demonstrate a huge gap in their education is\nalso not a satisfactory state of affairs.\n\nSuch extreme ignorance, in both the high reaches of academia and the high reaches of business, is a lollapalooza effect of a neg-\native sort, demonstrating grave defects in academia. Because the bad effect is a lollapalooza, we should expect to find intertwined,\nmultiple academic causes. I suspect at least two such causes:\n\nFirst, academic psychology, while it is admirable and useful as a list of ingenious and important experiments, lacks intradisci-\nplinary synthesis. In particular, not enough attention is given to lollapalooza effects coming from combinations of psychological\ntendencies. This creates a situation reminding one of a rustic teacher who tries to simplify schoolwork by rounding pi to an even\n3. And it violates Einstein\u2019s injunction that \u201ceverything should be made as simple as possible, but no more simple.\u201d In general, psy-\nchology is laid out and misunderstood, as electromagnetism would now be misunderstood if physics had produced many brilliant\nexperimenters like Michael Faraday and no grand synthesizer like James Clerk Maxwell.\n\nSecond, there is a truly horrible lack of synthesis blending psychology and other academic subjects. But only an interdiscipli-\nnary approach will correctly deal with reality\u2014in academia as with the Coca-Cola Company.\n\nIn short, academic psychology departments are immensely more important and useful than other academic departments\nthink. And at the same time, the psychology departments are immensely worse than most of their inhabitants think. It is, of\ncourse, normal for self-appraisal to be more positive than external appraisal. Indeed, a problem of this sort may have given you\nyour speaker today. But the size of this psychology department gap is preposterously large. In fact, the gap is so enormous that one\nvery eminent university, Chicago, simply abolished its psychology department, perhaps with an undisclosed hope of later creating\na better version.\n\nIn such a state of affairs, many years ago and with much that was plainly wrong already present, the New Coke fiasco occurred.\nTherein, Coke\u2019s executives came to the brink of destroying the most valuable trademark in the world. The academically correct re-\naction to this immense and well-publicized fiasco would have been the sort of reaction Boeing would display if three of its new air-\n\nplanes crashed in a single week. After all, product integrity is involved in each case, and the plain educational failure was immense.\n\f"}, "003935.png": {"text": "But almost no such responsible Boeing-like reaction has come from academia. Instead, academia, by and large, continues in\nits balkanized way to tolerate psychology professors who misteach psychology, non-psychology professors who fail to consider\npsychological effects obviously crucial in their subject matter, and professional schools that carefully preserve psychological igno-\nrance coming in with each entering class and are proud of their inadequacies.\n\nEven though this regrettable blindness and lassitude is now the normal academic result, are there exceptions providing hope\nthat disgraceful shortcomings of the education establishment will eventually be corrected? Here, my answer is a very optimistic\nyes.\n\nFor instance, consider the recent behavior of the economics department of the University of Chicago. Over the last decade,\nthis department has enjoyed a near monopoly of the Nobel Prizes in economics, largely by getting good predictions out of free-\nmarket models postulating man\u2019s rationality. And what is the reaction of this department after winning so steadily with its ra-\ntional-man approach? Well, it has just invited into a precious slot amid its company of greats a wise and witty Cornell economist,\nRichard Thaler.~ And it has done this because Thaler pokes fun at much that is holy at the University of Chicago. Indeed, Thaler\nbelieves, with me, that people are often massively irrational in ways predicted by psychology that must be taken into account in\nmicroeconomics.\n\nIn so behaving, the University of Chicago is imitating Darwin, who spent much of his long life thinking in reverse as he tried\nto disprove his own hardest-won and best-loved ideas. And so long as there are parts of academia that keep alive its best values\nby thinking in reverse like Darwin, we can confidently expect that silly educational practices will eventually be replaced by better\nones, exactly as Carl Jacobi might have predicted.\n\nThis will happen because the Darwinian approach, with its habitual objectivity taken on as a sort of hair shirt, is a mighty\napproach indeed. No less a figure than Einstein said that one of the four causes of his achievement was self-criticism, ranking right\nup there alongside curiosity, concentration, and perseverance.\n\nAnd, to further appreciate the power of self-criticism, consider where lies the grave of that very \u201cungifted\u201d undergraduate,\n\nCharles Darwin.

If, in many high places, a universal product as successful as Coca-Cola is not properly understood and ex-\nplained, it can\u2019t bode well for our competency in dealing with much else that is important.\n\nOf course, those of you with 50 percent of net worth in Coca-Cola stock, occurring because you tried to invest 10 percent after\nthinking like I did in making my pitch to Glotz, can ignore my message about psychology as too elementary for useful transmis-\nsion to you.

After all, 1\nargued: 1) If academia and business functioned with best practicable results, most denizens would be able to explain the success of\nthe Coca-Cola Company through parsimonious use of basic concepts and problem-solving techniques, yet 2) as the New Coke fiasco\nand its aftermath indicated, neither academia nor business had a respectable grasp of the simple realities causing the success of\nCoca-Cola.\n\nAs matters worked out, my 1996 talk failed to get through to almost all people hearing it. Then later, between 1996 and 2006,\neven when the talk\u2019s written version was slowly read twice by very intelligent people who admired me, its message likewise failed.\nIn almost all cases the message did not get through in any constructive way. On the other hand, no one said to me that the talk was\n\nwrong. Instead, people were puzzled briefly, then moved on.\n\f"}, "003937.png": {"text": "Thus my failure as a communicator was even more extreme than the cognitive failure I was trying to explain.

I have always\navoided all people who want to converse at length about the \u201cmeaning of meaning.\u201d Yet I chose as my title \u201cPractical Thought about\nPractical Thought?\u201d This was a start into tough territory. Then I worked out a long, complex interplay of five generalized, powerful\nproblem-solving tricks with basic ideas from a great many disciplines. I particularly included psychology, about which I wanted\nto demonstrate that there is much lamentable ignorance, even among highly educated people, some of whom teach psychology.\nMy demonstration, naturally, relied on correct psychology as part of my would-be demonstration. This was logically sound. But if\npsychological ignorance is widespread, why would most of my hearers recognize that my version of psychology was correct? Thus,\nfor most hearers, I did the rough equivalent of trying to explain some hard-to-comprehend ideas by simply defining those ideas as\nequivalent to themselves.\n\nAnd this was not the outer limit of my teaching folly. After I knew that the written version of my talk was hard to understand,\n\nI consented to an order of talks in Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanack wherein my psychology talk was Talk Eleven, inserted many pages after\nTalk Four. Instead, I should have recognized that the order of the two talks should be reversed, considering that Talk Four assumed\nthat readers had already mastered basic psychology, the subject of Talk Eleven.

I did this because I like closing the book with my most recent organization of psychology into a\nsort of checklist that has long been helpful to me.\n\nReaders, if they wish, can correct somewhat for the teaching defects that I have stubbornly retained.

If superior struc-\n\ntures are known and available, why don\u2019t educators more broadly utilize them? What could be more simple?\u201d\n\n \n\nToday I am going to engage in a game reminding us of our old professors: Socratic solitaire. I will ask and briefly answer five\n\nquestions:\n\n1. Do broadscale professionals need more multidisciplinary skill?\n\n2. Was our education sufficiently multidisciplinary?\n\n3. Inelite, broadscale soft science, what is the essential nature of practicable, best-form multidisciplinary education?\n4. In the last 50 years, how far has elite academia progressed toward attainable best-form multidisciplinarity?\n\n5. What educational practices would make progress faster?\n\nWe start with the question: Do broadscale professionals need more multidisciplinary skill?\n\f"}, "003940.png": {"text": "To answer the first question, we must first decide whether more multidisciplinarity will improve professional cognition. And to\ndecide what will cure bad cognition, it will help to know what causes it. One of Bernard Shaw\u2019s characters explained professional\ndefects as follows: \u201cIn the last analysis, every profession is a conspiracy against the laity.\u201d\n\nThere is a lot of truth in Shaw\u2019s diagnosis, as was early demonstrated when, in the 16th century, the dominant profession, the\nclergy, burned William Tyndale at the stake for translating the Bible into English.\n\nBut Shaw plainly understates the problem in implying that a conscious, self-interested malevolence is the main culprit. More\nimportant, there are frequent, terrible effects in professionals from intertwined subconscious mental tendencies, two of which are\nexceptionally prone to cause trouble: 1) incentive-caused bias, a natural cognitive drift toward the conclusion that what is good for\nthe professional is good for the client and the wider civilization; and 2) man-with-a-hammer tendency, with the name taken from\nthe proverb \u201cTo a man with only a hammer, every problem tends to look pretty much like a nail.\u201d\n\nOne partial cure for man-with-a-hammer tendency is obvious: If a man has a vast set of skills over multiple disciplines, he,\nby definition, carries multiple tools and therefore will limit bad cognitive effects from man-with-a-hammer tendency. Moreover,\nwhen he is multidisciplinary enough to absorb from practical psychology the idea that all his life he must fight bad effects from\nboth the tendencies I mentioned, both within himself and from others, he has taken a constructive step on the road to worldly\nwisdom.\n\nIf Ais narrow professional doctrine and B consists of the big, extra-useful concepts from other disciplines, then clearly the\nprofessional possessing A plus B will usually be better off than the poor possessor of A alone. How could it be otherwise? And thus,\nthe only rational excuse for not acquiring more B is that it is not practical to do so, given the man\u2019s need for A and the other urgent\ndemands in his life. I will later try to demonstrate that this excuse for unidisciplinarity, at least for our most gifted people, is usu-\nally unsound.\n\nMy second question is so easy to answer that I won\u2019t give it much time. Our education was far too unidisciplinary. Broadscale\nproblems, by definition, cross many academic disciplines. Accordingly, using a unidisciplinary attack on such problems is like\n\nplaying a bridge hand by counting trumps while ignoring all else. This is bonkers, sort of like the Mad Hatter\u2019s tea party. But none-\n\f"}, "003941.png": {"text": "theless, too much that is similar remains present in professional practice and, even worse, has long been encouraged in isolated\ndepartments of soft science, defined as everything less fundamental than biology.\n\nEven in our youth, some of the best professors were horrified by bad effects from the balkanization of academia into insular,\nturf-protecting enclaves, wherein notions were maintained by leaps of faith plus exclusion of nonbelievers. Alfred North White-\nhead, for one, long ago sounded an alarm in strong language when he spoke of \u201cthe fatal unconnectedness of academic disci-\nplines.\u201d And since then, elite educational institutions, agreeing more and more with Whitehead, have steadily fought unconnect-\nedness by bringing in more multidisciplinarity, causing some awesome plaudits to be won in our time by great unconnectedness\nfighters at the borders of academic disciplines, for instance Harvard\u2019s E. O. Wilson and Caltech\u2019s Linus Pauling. Modern academia\nnow gives more multidisciplinarity than we received and is plainly right to do so.\n\nThe natural third question then becomes: What is now the goal? What is the essential nature of best-form multidisciplinarity\nin elite education? This question, too, is easy to answer. All we have to do is examine our most successful narrow-scale education,\nidentify essential elements, and scale up those elements to reach the sensible solution.\n\nTo find the best educational narrow-scale model, we have to look not at unthreatened schools of education and the like, too\nmuch driven by our two counterproductive psychological tendencies and other bad influences, but instead look where incentives\nfor effective education are strongest and results are most closely measured. This leads us to a logical place: the hugely successful\neducation now mandatory for pilots. Yes, Iam suggesting today that mighty Harvard would do better if it thought more about\npilot training.\n\nIn piloting, as in other professions, one great hazard is a bad effect from man-with-a-hammer tendency. We don\u2019t want a pilot,\never, to respond to a hazard as if it was hazard X just because his mind contains only a hazard X model. And so, for that and other\n\nreasons, we train a pilot in a strict six-element system:\n\n1. His formal education is wide enough to cover practically everything useful in piloting.\n\f"}, "003942.png": {"text": "Nn\n\n. His knowledge of practically everything needed by pilots is not taught just well enough to enable him to pass one test or two;\n\ninstead, all his knowledge is raised to practice-based fluency, even in handling two or three intertwined hazards at once.\n\n\u00bb\n\nLike any good algebraist, he is made to think sometimes in a forward fashion and sometimes in reverse, and so he learns when\nto concentrate mostly on what he wants to happen and also when to concentrate mostly on avoiding what he does not want to\n\nhappen.\n\n=\n\nHis training time is allocated among subjects so as to minimize damage from his later malfunctions, and so what is most im-\n\nportant in his performance gets the most training coverage and is raised to the highest fluency levels.\n\n\u201d\n\nChecklist routines are always mandatory for him.\n\na\n\n. Even after original training, he is forced into a special knowledge maintenance routine: regular use of the aircraft simulator to\n\nprevent atrophy through long disuse of skills needed to cope with rare and important problems.\n\nThe need for this clearly correct six-element system, with its large demands in a narrow-scale field where stakes are high, is\nrooted in the deep structure of the human mind. Therefore, we must expect that the education we need for broadscale problem-\nsolving will keep all these elements but with awesomely expanded coverage for each element. How could it be otherwise?\n\nThus it follows, as the night the day, that in our most elite broadscale education, wherein we are trying to make silk purses\nout of silk, we need for best results to have multidisciplinary coverage of immense amplitude, with all needed skills raised to an\never-maintained practice-based fluency, including considerable power of synthesis at boundaries between disciplines, with the\nhighest fluency levels being achieved where they are most needed, with forward and reverse thinking techniques being employed\nin amanner reminding one of inversion in algebra, and with checklist routines being a permanent part of the knowledge sys-\ntem. There can be no other way, no easier way, to broadscale worldly wisdom. Thus the task, when first identified in its immense\nbreadth, seems daunting, verging on impossible.\n\nBut the task, considered in full context, is far from impossible when we consider three factors:\n\f"}, "003943.png": {"text": "First, the concept of \u201call needed skills\u201d lets us recognize that we don\u2019t have to raise everyone\u2019s skill in celestial mechanics to that\nof [Pierre-Simon] Laplace and also ask everyone to achieve a similar skill level in all other knowledge. Instead, it turns out that\nthe truly big ideas in each discipline, learned only in essence, carry most of the freight. And they are not so numerous, nor are their\ninteractions so complex, that a large and multidisciplinary understanding is impossible for many, given large amounts of talent\nand time.\n\nSecond, in elite education, we have available the large amounts of talent and time that we need. After all, we are educating the\ntop 1 percent in aptitude, using teachers who, on average, have more aptitude than the students. And we have roughly 13 long\nyears in which to turn our most promising 12-year-olds into starting professionals.\n\nThird, thinking by inversion and thorough use of checklists is easily learned, in broadscale life as in piloting.\n\nMoreover, we can believe in the attainability of broad multidisciplinary skill for the same reason the fellow from Arkansas gave\nfor his belief in baptism: \u201cI\u2019ve seen it done.\u201d We all know of individuals, modern Ben Franklins, who have 1) achieved a massive\nmultidisciplinary synthesis with less time in formal education than is now available to our numerous brilliant young, and 2) thus\nbecome better performers in their own disciplines, not worse, despite diversion of learning time to matter outside the normal cov-\nerage of their own disciplines.\n\nGiven the time and talent available and examples of successful masters of multiple disciplines, what is shown by our present\nfailure to minimize bad effects from man-with-a-hammer tendency is only that you can\u2019t win big in multidisciplinarity in soft-\nscience academia if you are so satisfied with the status quo, or so frightened by the difficulties of change, that you don\u2019t try hard\nenough to win big.\n\nWhich brings us to our fourth question: Judged with reference to an optimized, feasible multidisciplinary goal, how much has\nelite soft-science education been corrected after we left?\n\nThe answer is that many things have been tried as corrections in the direction of better multidisciplinarity. And, after allowing\nfor some counterproductive results, there has been some considerable improvement, net. But much desirable correction is still un-\n\ndone and lies far ahead.\n\f"}, "003944.png": {"text": "For instance, soft-science academia has increasingly found it helpful when professors from different disciplines collaborate\nor when a professor has been credentialed in more than one discipline. But a different sort of correction has usually worked best,\nnamely augmentation, or a \u201ctake what you wish\u201d practice that encourages any discipline to simply assimilate whatever it chooses\nfrom other disciplines. Perhaps it has worked best because it bypassed academic squabbles rooted in the tradition and territoriality\nthat had caused the unidisciplinary folly for which correction was now sought.\n\nIn any event, through increased use of take what you wish, many soft-science disciplines reduced folly from man-with-a-\nhammer tendency. For instance, led by our classmate Roger Fisher, ~ the law schools brought in negotiation, drawing on other dis-\nciplines. Over 3 million copies of Roger\u2019s wise and ethical negotiation book have now been sold, and his life\u2019s achievement may well\nbe the best, ever, from our whole class. The law schools also brought in a lot of sound and useful economics, even some good game\ntheory to enlighten antitrust law by better explaining how competition really works.\n\nEconomics, in turn, took in from a biologist the tragedy of the commons model, thus correctly finding a wicked invisible foot\nin coexistence with Adam Smith\u2019s angelic invisible hand. These days, there is even some behavioral economics, wisely seeking aid\nfrom psychology.\n\nHowever, an extremely permissive practice like take what you wish was not destined to have 100 percent admirable results\nin soft science. Indeed, in some of its worst outcomes, it helped changes like the assimilation of Freudianism in some literature\ndepartments; the importation into many places of extremist political ideologies of the left or right that had, for their possessors,\nmade regaining objectivity almost as unlikely as regaining virginity; and the importation into many law and business schools of\nhard-form, efficient-market theory by misguided would-be experts in corporate finance, one of whom kept explaining Berkshire\nHathaway\u2019s investing success by adding standard deviations of luck until, at six standard deviations, he encountered enough deri-\nsion to force a change in explanation.\n\nMoreover, even when it avoided such lunacies, take what you wish had some serious defects. For instance, takings from more\nfundamental disciplines were often done without attribution, sometimes under new names, with little attention given to rank in\n\na fundamentalness order for absorbed concepts. Such practices 1) act like a lousy filing system that must impair the successful use\n\f"}, "003945.png": {"text": "and synthesis of absorbed knowledge, and 2) do not maximize in soft science the equivalent of Linus Pauling\u2019s systematic mining\nof physics to improve chemistry. There must be a better way.\n\nThis brings us, finally, to our last question: In elite soft science, what practices would hasten our progress toward optimized\ndisciplinarity? Here, again, there are some easy answers:\n\nFirst, many more courses should be mandatory, not optional. And this, in turn, requires that the people who decide what is\nmandatory must possess large, multidisciplinary knowledge maintained in fluency. This conclusion is as obvious in the training\nof the would-be broadscale problem-solver as it is in the training of the would-be pilot. For instance, both psychology mastery and\naccounting mastery should be required as outcomes in legal education. Yet in many elite places, even today, there are no such re-\nquirements. Often, such is the narrowness of mind of the program designers that they neither see what is needed and missing nor\nare able to fix deficiencies.\n\nSecond, there should be much more problem-solving practice that crosses several disciplines, including practice that mimics\nthe function of the aircraft simulator in preventing loss of skills through disuse.\n\nLet me give an example, roughly remembered, of this sort of teaching by a very wise but untypical Harvard Business School\nprofessor many decades ago. This professor gave a test involving two unworldly old ladies who had just inherited a New England\nshoe factory making branded shoes and beset with serious business problems described in great detail. The professor then gave\nthe students ample time to answer with written advice to the old ladies. In response to the answers, the professor gave every stu-\ndent an undesirable grade except for one student who was graded at the top by a wide margin.\n\nWhat was the winning answer? It was very short and roughly as follows: \u201cThis business field and this particular business, in its\nparticular location, present crucial problems that are so difficult that unworldly old ladies cannot wisely try to solve them through\nhired help. Given the difficulties and unavoidable agency costs, the old ladies should promptly sell the shoe factory, probably to the\ncompetitor who would enjoy the greatest marginal utility advantage.\u201d\n\nThus, the winning answer relied not on what the students had most recently been taught in business school but instead on\n\nmore fundamental concepts, like agency costs and marginal utility, lifted from undergraduate psychology and economics. Ah, my\n\f"}, "003946.png": {"text": "fellow members of the Harvard Law Class of 1948\u2014if only we had been much more often tested like that, just think of what more\nwe might have accomplished!\n\nIncidentally, many elite private schools now wisely use such multidisciplinary methods in seventh grade science, while at the\nsame time many graduate schools have not yet seen the same light. This is one more sad example of Whitehead\u2019s fatal unconnect-\nedness in education.\n\nThird, most soft-science professional schools should increase their use of the best business periodicals, like The Wall Street\nJournal, Forbes, Fortune, etc. Such periodicals are now quite good and perform the function of the aircraft simulator if used to\nprompt practice in relating events to multidisciplinary causes, often intertwined. And sometimes the periodicals even introduce\nnew models for causes instead of merely refreshing old knowledge. Also, it is not just slightly sound to have the student practice\nin school what he must practice lifelong after formal education is over if he is going to maximize his good judgment. I know no\nperson in business, respected for verified good judgment, whose wisdom maintenance system does not include use of such period-\nicals. Why should academia be different?\n\nFourth, in filling scarce academic vacancies, professors of superstrong, passionate political ideology, whether on the left or\nright, should usually be avoided. So also for students. Best-form multidisciplinarity requires an objectivity such passionate people\nhave lost, and a difficult synthesis is not likely to be achieved by minds in ideological fetters. In our day, some Harvard Law profes-\nsors could and did point to a wonderful example of just such ideology-based folly. This, of course, was the law school at Yale, which\nwas then viewed by many at Harvard as trying to improve legal education by importing a particular political ideology as a domi-\nnant factor.\n\nFifth, soft science should more intensely imitate the fundamental organizing ethos of hard science, defined as the fundamental\nfour-discipline combination of math, physics, chemistry, and engineering. This ethos deserves more imitation. After all, hard\nscience has, by a wide margin, the best record for both 1) avoiding unidisciplinary folly and 2) making user-friendly a big patch of\nmultidisciplinary domain, with frequent, good results like those of physicist Richard Feynman when he so quickly found in cold\n\nO-rings the cause of our greatest space shuttle disaster.\n\f"}, "003947.png": {"text": "Previous extensions of the ethos into softer fare have worked well. For instance, biology, starting 150 years ago with a descrip-\ntive mess not much related to deep theory, has gradually absorbed the fundamental organizing ethos with marvelous results, as\nnew generations have come to use better thinking methods containing models that answer the question \u201cWhy?\u201d And there is no\nclear reason why the ethos of hard science can\u2019t also help in disciplines far less fundamental than biology.\n\nHere, as I interpret it, is this fundamental organizing ethos I am talking about:\n\n.

And as some evidence for the value of taking very\nseriously the fundamental organizing ethos, I offer the example of my own life.\n\nIcame to Harvard Law School very poorly educated, with desultory work habits and no college degree. I was admitted over the\nobjection of Warren Abner Seavey through the intervention of family friend Roscoe Pound. I had taken one silly course in biol-\nogy in high school, briefly learning, mostly by rote, an obviously incomplete theory of evolution, portions of the anatomy of the\nparamecium and frog, plus a ridiculous concept of \u201cprotoplasm\u201d that has since disappeared.\n\nTo this day, I have never taken any course, anywhere, in chemistry, economics, psychology, or business.

For instance, I was productively led into psychology, where\nIhad no plans to go, creating large advantages that deserve a story on another day.\n\nToday, I have no more story. I have finished my talk by answering my own questions as best I could in a brief time. What is most\ninteresting to me in my answers is that, while everything I have said is non-original and has long been obvious to the point of\n\nbanality to many sound and well-educated minds, all the evils I decry remain grossly over-present in the best of our soft-science\n\f"}, "003949.png": {"text": "educational domains, wherein virtually every professor has a too-unidisciplinary habit of mind, even while a better model exists\njust across the aisle in his own university.\n\nTo me, this ridiculous outcome implies that the soft-science departments tolerate perverse incentives.

He posits a choice for his audience: the model of genius statesman Ben Franklin or that of\ndisgraced fund manager Bernie Cornfeld. Referring to his days as a limited partnership manager, Charlie employs, as\nis typical, self-deprecation and self-reflection: \u201cEarly Charlie Munger is a horrible career model for the young.\u201d\nIf Charlie can emerge from that state successfully, he seems to be saying, so can the wayward foundation managers in\n\nhis audience.\n\n \n\nIam speaking here today because my friend John Argue asked me. And John well knew that I\u2014who, unlike many other speakers\non your agenda, have nothing to sell any of you\u2014would be irreverent about much current investment practice in large institu-\ntions, including charitable foundations. Therefore, any hostility my talk will cause should be directed at John Argue, who comes\nfrom the legal profession and may even enjoy it.\n\nIt was long the norm at large charitable foundations to invest mostly in unleveraged, marketable domestic securities, mostly\nequities. The equities were selected by one or a very few investment counseling organizations. But in recent years, there has been\na drift toward more complexity. Some foundations, following the lead of institutions like Yale, have tried to become much better\nversions of Bernie Cornfeld\u2019s~ \u201cfund of funds.\u201d This is an amazing development. Few would have predicted that long after Corn-\nfeld\u2019s fall into disgrace, major universities would be leading foundations into Cornfeld\u2019s system.\n\nNow, in some foundations, there are not few but many investment counselors, chosen by an additional layer of consultants who\nare hired to decide which investment counselors are best, help in allocating funds to various categories, make sure that foreign\n\nsecurities are not neglected in favor of domestic securities, check the validity of claimed investment records, ensure that claimed\n\f"}, "003952.png": {"text": "investment styles are scrupulously followed, and help augment an already large diversification in a way that conforms to the latest\nnotions of corporate finance professors about volatility and \u201cbeta.\u201d\n\nBut even with this amazingly active, would-be polymathic new layer of consultants choosing consultants, the individual in-\nvestment counselors, in picking common stocks, still rely to a considerable extent on a third layer of consultants.\n\nThe third layer consists of the security analysts employed by investment banks. These security analysts receive enormous\nsalaries, sometimes set in seven figures after bidding wars. The hiring investment banks recoup these salaries from two sources: 1)\ncommissions and trading spreads borne by security buyers, some of which are rebated as \u201csoft dollars\u201d to money managers, plus 2)\ninvestment banking charges paid by corporations that appreciate the enthusiastic way their securities are being recommended by\nthe security analysts.\n\nThere is one thing sure about all this complexity, including its touches of behavior lacking the full punctilio of honor: Even\nwhen nothing but unleveraged stock picking is involved, the total cost of all the investment management, plus the frictional\ncosts of fairly often getting in and out of many large investment positions, can easily reach 3 percent of foundation net worth per\nannum if foundations, urged on by consultants, add new activity year after year. This full cost doesn\u2019t show up in conventional ac-\ncounting. But that is because accounting has limitations and not because the full cost isn\u2019t present.\n\nNext, we come to time for a little arithmetic: It is one thing each year to pay the croupiers 3 percent of starting wealth when the\naverage foundation is enjoying a real return, say, of 17 percent before the croupiers\u2019 take. But it is not written in the stars that foun-\ndations will always gain 17 percent gross, acommon result in recent years. And if the average annual gross real return from in-\ndexed investment in equities goes back, say, to 5 percent over some long future period, and the croupiers\u2019 take turns out to remain\nthe waste it has always been, even for the average intelligent player, then the average intelligent foundation will be in a prolonged,\nuncomfortable shrinking mode. After all, 5 percent minus 3 percent minus 5 percent in donations leaves an annual shrinkage of 3\npercent.\n\nAll the equity investors, in total, will surely bear a performance disadvantage per annum equal to the total croupiers\u2019 costs they\n\nhave jointly elected to bear.

After all, centuries before Christ, Demos-\nthenes noted, \u201cWhat a man wishes, he will believe.\u201d And in self-appraisals of prospects and talents, it is the norm, as Demosthenes\npredicted, for people to be ridiculously over-optimistic. For instance, a careful survey in Sweden showed that 90 percent of au-\ntomobile drivers considered themselves above average. And people who are successfully selling something, as investment coun-\nselors do, make Swedish drivers sound like depressives. Virtually every investment expert\u2019s public assessment is that he is above\naverage, no matter what the evidence to the contrary.\n\nBut you may think, \u201cMy foundation, at least, will be above average. It is well endowed, hires the best, and considers all invest-\nment issues at length and with objective professionalism.\u201d And to this I respond that an excess of what seems like professionalism\nwill often hurt you horribly, precisely because the careful procedures themselves often lead to overconfidence in their outcome.\n\nGeneral Motors recently made just such a mistake, and it was a lollapalooza. Using fancy consumer surveys\u2014its excess of\nprofessionalism\u2014it concluded not to put a fourth door in a truck designed to serve as the equivalent of a comfortable five-passen-\nger car. Its competitors, more basic, had actually seen five people enter and exit cars. Moreover, they had noticed that people were\nused to four doors in a comfortable five-passenger car and that biological creatures ordinarily prefer effort minimization in routine\nactivities and don\u2019t like removals of long-enjoyed benefits. There are only two words that come instantly to mind in reviewing\nGeneral Motors\u2019 horrible decision, which has blown many hundreds of millions of dollars, and one of those words is \u201coops.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the hedge fund known as Long-Term Capital Management recently collapsed through overconfidence in its highly\nleveraged methods, despite IQs of its principals that must have averaged 160. Smart, hardworking people aren't exempted from\nprofessional disasters from overconfidence. Often, they just go aground in the more difficult voyages they choose, relying on their\nself-appraisals that they have superior talents and methods.\n\nItis, of course, irritating that extra care in thinking is not all good but also introduces extra error. But most good things have\n\nundesired side effects, and thinking is no exception.

What are this fearful foundation's options as it seeks improved prospects?\n\nThere are at least three modern choices:\n\n1. The foundation can both dispense with its consultants and reduce its investment turnover as it changes to indexed invest-\n\nment in equities.\n\nNn\n\n. The foundation can follow the example of Berkshire Hathaway, and thus get total annual croupier costs below one-tenth of\n1 percent of principal per annum, by investing with virtually total passivity in a very few much-admired domestic corpora-\ntions. And there is no reason why some outside advice can\u2019t be used in this process. All the fee payer has to do is suitably con-\ntrol the high talent in investment counseling organizations so that the servant becomes the useful tool of its master, instead\n\nof serving itself under the perverse incentives of a sort of Mad Hatter\u2019s tea party.\n\n\u00bb\n\n. The foundation can supplement unleveraged investment in marketable equities with investment in limited partnerships that\ndo some combination of the following: unleveraged investment in high-tech corporations in their infancy; leveraged invest-\nments in corporate buyouts; leveraged relative value trades in equities; and leveraged convergence trades and other exotic\n\ntrades in all kinds of securities and derivatives.\n\f"}, "003955.png": {"text": "For the obvious reasons given by purveyors of indexed equities, I think choice 1, indexing, is a wiser choice for the average foun-\ndation than what it is now doing in unleveraged equity investment. And particularly so, as its present total croupier costs exceed 1\npercent of principal per annum. Indexing can\u2019t work well forever if almost everybody turns to it. But it will work all right for a long\ntime.\n\nChoice 3, investment in fancy limited partnerships, is largely beyond the scope of this talk. I will only say that the Munger Foun-\ndation does not so invest, and briefly mention two considerations bearing on LBO funds.\n\nThe first consideration bearing on LBO funds is that buying 100 percent of corporations with much financial leverage and two\nlayers of promotional carry\u2014one for the management and one for the general partners in the LBO fund\u2014is no sure thing to out-\nperform equity indexes in the future if equity indexes perform poorly in the future. In substance, an LBO fund is a better way of\nbuying equivalents of marketable equities on margin, and the debt could prove disastrous if future marketable equity performance\nis bad. And particularly so if the bad performance comes from generally bad business conditions.\n\nThe second consideration is increasing competition for LBO candidates. For instance, if the LBO candidates are good service\ncorporations, General Electric can now buy more than $10 billion\u2019s worth per year in GE\u2019s credit corporation, with 100 percent\ndebt financing at an interest rate only slightly higher than the US government is paying. This sort of thing is not ordinary com-\npetition but super-competition. And there are now very many LBO funds, both large and small, mostly awash in money and with\ngeneral partners highly incentivized to buy something. In addition, there is increased buying competition from corporations other\nthan GE using some combination of debt and equity.\n\nIn short, in the LBO field, there is a buried covariance with marketable equities\u2014toward disaster in generally bad business con-\nditions\u2014and competition is now extreme.\n\nGiven time limitations, I can say no more about limited partnerships, one of which I once ran. This leaves for extensive dis-\ncussion only foundation choice 2, more imitation of the investment practices of Berkshire Hathaway in maintaining marketable\nequity portfolios with virtually zero turnover and with only a very few stocks chosen. This brings us to the question of how much\n\ninvestment diversification is desirable at foundations.\n\f"}, "003956.png": {"text": "Ihave more than skepticism regarding the orthodox view that huge diversification is a must for those wise enough, so that in-\ndexation is not the logical mode for equity investment. I think the orthodox view is grossly mistaken.\n\nIn the United States, a person or institution with almost all wealth invested long-term in just three fine domestic corporations\nis securely rich. And why should such an owner care if, at any time, most other investors are faring somewhat better or worse?\nParticularly when he rationally believes, like Berkshire, that his long-term results will be superior by reason of his lower costs, re-\nquired emphasis on long-term effects, and concentration in his most preferred choices.\n\nI go even further. I think it can be a rational choice, in some situations, for a family or a foundation to remain 90 percent\nconcentrated in one equity. Indeed, I hope the Mungers follow roughly this course. And I note that the [Robert] Woodruff foun-\ndations have, so far, proven extremely wise to retain an approximately 90 percent concentration in the founder's Coca-Cola stock.\nIt would be interesting to calculate just how all American foundations would have fared if they had never sold a share of founder's\nstock. Very many, I think, would now be much better off.\n\nBut, you may say, the diversifiers simply took out insurance against a catastrophe that didn\u2019t occur. And I reply: There are worse\nthings than some foundation\u2019s losing relative clout in the world, and rich institutions, like rich individuals, should do a lot of self-\ninsurance if they want to maximize long-term results.\n\nFurthermore, all the good in the world is not done by foundation donations. Much more good is done through the ordinary\nbusiness operations of the corporations in which the foundations invest. And some corporations do much more good than others\ndo in a way that gives investors therein better-than-average long-term prospects. And I don\u2019t consider it foolish, stupid, evil, or\nillegal for a foundation to greatly concentrate investment in what it admires or even loves. Indeed, Ben Franklin required just such\nan investment practice for the charitable endowment created by his will.\n\nOne other aspect of Berkshire\u2019s equity investment practice deserves comparative mention. So far, there has been almost no di-\nrect foreign investment at Berkshire and much foreign investment at foundations.\n\nRegarding this divergent history, I wish to say that I agree with Peter Drucker~ that the culture and legal systems of the United\n\nStates are especially favorable to shareholder interests compared to other interests and compared to most other countries. Indeed,\n\f"}, "003957.png": {"text": "there are many other countries where any good going to public shareholders has a very low priority and almost every other con-\nstituency stands higher in line.\n\nThis factor, I think, is under-weighed at many investment institutions, probably because it does not easily lead to quantitative\nthinking using modern financial technique. But some important factor doesn\u2019t lose share of force just because some \u201cexpert\u201d can\nbetter measure other types of force. Generally, I tend to prefer over direct foreign investment Berkshire\u2019s practice of participating\nin foreign economies through the likes of Coca-Cola and Gillette.\n\nTo conclude, I will make one controversial prediction and one controversial argument.\n\nThe controversial prediction is that, if some of you make your investment style more like Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s, in a long-term\nretrospect, you will be unlikely to have cause for regret, even if you can\u2019t get Warren Buffett to work for nothing. Instead, Berkshire\nwill have cause for regret as it faces more intelligent investment competition. But Berkshire won\u2019t actually regret any disadvantage\nfrom your enlightenment. We only want what success we can get despite encouraging others to share our general views about\nreality.\n\nMy controversial argument is an additional consideration weighing against the complex, high-cost investment modalities\nbecoming ever more popular at foundations. Even if, contrary to my suspicions, such modalities should turn out to work pretty\nwell, most of the money-making activity would contain profoundly antisocial effects. This would be so because the activity would\nexacerbate the current harmful trend in which ever more of the nation\u2019s ethical young brainpower is attracted into lucrative\nmoney management and its attendant modern frictions, as distinguished from work providing much more value to others. Money\nmanagement does not create the right examples. Early Charlie Munger is a horrible career model for the young because not enough\nwas delivered to civilization in return for what was wrested from capitalism. And other, similar career models are even worse.\nRather than encourage such models, a more constructive choice at foundations is long-term investment concentration in a few do-\nmestic corporations that are wisely admired.\n\nWhy not thus imitate Ben Franklin? After all, old Ben was very effective in doing public good. And he was a pretty good investor,\n\ntoo. Better his model, I think, than Bernie Cornfeld\u2019s. The choice is plainly yours to make.\n\f"}, "003958.png": {"text": "TALK SIX REVISITED\n\nA lot of water has passed under the bridge since this talk was made in 1998.

Nonetheless, I have\nconcluded that most PhD economists under-appraise the power of the common stock-based wealth effect under current extreme\nconditions.\n\nEveryone now agrees on two things. First, spending proclivity is influenced in an upward direction when stock prices go up, and\nin a downward direction when stock prices go down. Second, the proclivity to spend is terribly important in macroeconomics.\n\nHowever, the professionals disagree about the size and timing of wealth effects and how they interact with other effects, includ-\ning the obvious complication that increased spending tends to drive up stock prices while stock prices are concurrently driving up\nspending. Also, of course, rising stock prices increase corporate earnings even when spending is static, for instance by reducing\npension cost accruals, after which stock prices tend to rise more. Thus wealth effects involve mathematical puzzles that are not\nnearly so well worked out as physics theories and never can be.\n\nThe wealth effect from rising US stock prices is particularly interesting right now for two reasons. First, there has never been an\nadvance so extreme in the price of widespread stock holdings, and with stock prices going up so much faster than GNP, the related\nwealth effect must now be bigger than was common before. Second, what has happened in Japan over roughly the last 10 years has\n\nshaken up academic economics, as it obviously should, creating strong worries about recession from wealth effects in reverse.\n\f"}, "003961.png": {"text": "In Japan, with much financial corruption, there was an extreme rise in stock and real estate prices for a very long time, accom-\npanied by extreme real economic growth compared to the United States. Then, asset values crashed, and the Japanese economy\nstalled out at a very suboptimal level. After this, Japan, a modern economy that had learned all the would-be corrective Keyne-\nsian\u2122 and monetary tricks, pushed these tricks hard and long. Japan, for many years, not only ran an immense government deficit\nbut also reduced interest rates to a place within hailing distance of zero and kept them there. Nonetheless, the Japanese economy,\nyear after year, stays stalled, as Japanese proclivity to spend stubbornly resists all the tricks of the economists, and Japanese stock\nprices stay down.\n\nThis Japanese experience is a disturbing example for everyone, and if something like it happened here, it would leave shrunken\ncharitable foundations feeling clobbered by fate. Let us hope, as is probably the case, that the sad situation in Japan is caused in\nsome large part by social-psychological effects and corruption peculiar to Japan. In such case, our country may be at least half as\nsafe as is widely assumed.\n\nWell, grant that spending proclivity, as influenced by stock prices, is now an important subject, and that the long Japanese re-\ncession is disturbing. How big are the economic influences of US stock prices?\n\nA median conclusion of the economics professionals, based mostly on data collected by the Federal Reserve System, would\nprobably be that the wealth effect on spending from stock prices is not all that big. After all, even now, real household net worth,\nexcluding pensions, is probably up by less than 100 percent over the last 10 years and remains a pretty modest figure per house-\nhold, while market value of common stock is probably not yet one-third of aggregate household net worth, excluding pensions.\nMoreover, such household wealth in common stocks is almost incredibly concentrated, and the superrich don\u2019t consume in pro-\nportion to their wealth. Leaving out pensions, the top 1 percent of households probably hold about 50 percent of common stock\n\nvalue, and the bottom 80 percent probably hold about 4 percent.\n\n \n\nBased on such data, plus unexciting past correlation between stock prices and spending, it is easy for a professional economist\n\nto conclude, say, that even if the average household spends incrementally at a rate of 3 percent of asset values in stock, consumer\n\f"}, "003962.png": {"text": "spending would have risen less than 0.5 percent per year over the last 10 years as a consequence of the huge, unprecedented, long-\nlasting, consistent boom in stock prices.\n\nI believe that such economic thinking widely misses underlying reality right now. To me, such thinking looks at the wrong\nnumbers and asks the wrong questions. Let me, the ultimate amateur, boldly try to do a little better, or at least a little differently.\n\nFor one thing, I have been told, probably correctly, that Federal Reserve data collection, due to practical obstacles, doesn\u2019t\nproperly take into account pension effects, including effects from 401(k) and similar plans. Assume some 63-year-old dentist has\n$1 million in GE stock in a private pension plan. The stock goes up in value to $2 million, and the dentist, feeling flush, trades in\nhis very old Chevrolet and leases a new Cadillac at the giveaway rate now common. To me, this is an obvious large wealth effect in\nthe dentist\u2019s spending. To many economists, using Federal Reserve data, I suspect the occasion looks like profligate dissaving by\nthe dentist. To me, the dentist, and many others like him, seems to be spending a lot more because of a very strong pension-related\nwealth effect. Accordingly, I believe that the present-day wealth effect from pension plans is far from trivial and much larger than\nit was in the past.\n\nFor another thing, the traditional thinking of economists often does not take into account implications from the idea of \u201cbez-\nzle.\u201d Let me repeat: bezzle, B-E-Z-Z-L-E. The word \u201cbezzle\u201d is a contraction of the word \u201cembezzle,\u201d and it was coined by Harvard\neconomics professor John Kenneth Galbraith\u00ae to stand for the increase in any period of undisclosed embezzlement. Galbraith\ncoined the \u201cbezzle\u201d word because he saw that undisclosed embezzlement, per dollar, has a very powerful stimulating effect on\nspending. After all, the embezzler spends more because he has more income, and his employer spends as before because he doesn\u2019t\nknow any of his assets are gone.\n\nBut Galbraith did not push his insight on. He was content to stop with being a stimulating gadfly. So I will now try to push Gal-\nbraith\u2019s \u201cbezzle\u201d concept to the next logical level.\n\nAs Keynes showed, in a native economy relying on earned income, when the seamstress sells a coat to the shoemaker for $20,\nthe shoemaker has $20 less to spend and the seamstress has $20 more to spend. There is no lollapalooza effect on aggregate spend-\n\ning. But when the government prints another $20 bill and uses it to buy a pair of shoes, the shoemaker has another $20 and no one\n\f"}, "003963.png": {"text": "feels poorer. And when the shoemaker next buys a coat, the process goes on and on, not to an infinite increase, but with what is\nnow called the Keynesian multiplier effect, a sort of lollapalooza effect on spending.\n\nSimilarly, an undisclosed embezzlement has stronger stimulative effects per dollar on spending than a same-sized honest\nexchange of goods. Galbraith, being Scottish, liked the bleakness of life demonstrated by his insight. After all, the Scottish enthu-\nsiastically accepted the idea of preordained, unfixable infant damnation. But the rest of us don\u2019t like Galbraith\u2019s insight. Neverthe-\nless, we have to recognize that Galbraith was roughly right.\n\nNo doubt Galbraith saw the Keynesian multiplier-type economic effects promised by increases in bezzle. But he stopped there.\nAfter all, bezzle could not grow very big because the discovery of massive theft was nearly inevitable and sure to have reverse\neffects in due course. Thus, the increase in private bezzle could not drive economies up and up, and on and on, at least for a consid-\nerable time, like government spending.\n\nDeterred by the apparent smallness of economic effects from his insight, Galbraith did not ask the next logical question: Are\nthere important functional equivalents of bezzle that are large and not promptly self-destructive?\n\nMy answer to this question is yes. I will next describe only one. I will join Galbraith in coining new words: first, \u201cfebezzle,\u201d to\nstand for the functional equivalent of bezzle; second, \u201cfebezzlement,\u201d to describe the process of creating febezzle; and third, \u201cfebez-\nzlers,\u201d to describe persons engaged in febezzlement. Then, I will identify an important source of febezzle right in this room. You\npeople, I think, have created a lot of febezzle through your foolish investment management practices in dealing with your large\nholdings of common stock.\n\nIf a foundation or other investor wastes 3 percent of assets per year in unnecessary, nonproductive investment costs in manag-\ninga strongly rising stock portfolio, it still feels richer, despite the waste, while the people getting the wasted 3 percent, febezzlers\nthough they are, think they are virtuously earning income. The situation is functioning like undisclosed embezzlement without\nbeing self-limited. Indeed, the process can expand for a long while by feeding on itself. And all the while, what looks like spending\nfrom the earned income of the receivers of the wasted 3 percent is, in substance, spending from a disguised wealth effect from ris-\n\ning stock prices.\n\f"}, "003964.png": {"text": "This room contains many people pretty well stricken by expired years, in my generation or the one following. We tend to\nbelieve in thrift and avoiding waste as good things, a process that has worked well for us. It is paradoxical and disturbing to us that\neconomists have long praised foolish spending as a necessary ingredient of a successful economy. Let us call foolish expenditures\n\u201cfoolexures.\u201d And now you holders of old values are hearing one of your own add to the case for foolexures the case for febezzle-\nments, the functional equivalent of embezzlements. This may not seem like a nice way to start a new day. Please be assured that I\ndon\u2019t like febezzlements. It is just that I think febezzlements are widespread and have powerful economic effects. And I also think\nthat one should recognize reality even when one doesn\u2019t like it\u2014indeed, especially when one doesn\u2019t like it. Also, I think one should\ncheerfully endure paradox that one can\u2019t remove by good thinking. Even in pure mathematics, they can\u2019t remove all paradox, and\nthe rest of us should also recognize we are going to have to endure a lot of paradox, like it or not.\n\nLet me also take this occasion to state that my previous notion of 3 percent of assets per annum in waste in much of institu-\ntional investment management related to stocks is quite likely too low in a great many cases. A friend, after my talk to foundation\nfinancial officers, sent me a summary of a study about mutual fund investors. The study concluded that the typical mutual fund\ninvestor gained at 7.25 percent per year in a 15-year period when the average stock fund gained at 12.8 percent per year, presum-\nably after expenses. Thus, the real performance lag for investors was over 5 percent of assets per year in addition to whatever per-\ncentage per year the mutual funds, after expenses, lagged behind stock market averages.\n\nIf this mutual fund study is roughly right, it raises huge questions about foundation wisdom in changing investment managers\nall the time as mutual fund investors do. If the extra lag reported in the mutual fund study exists, it is probably caused in consid-\nerable measure by folly in the constant removal of assets from lagging portfolio managers being forced to liquidate stock holdings,\nfollowed by the placement of removed assets with new investment managers that have high-pressure, asset-gaining hoses in their\nmouths and clients whose investment results will not be improved by the super-rapid injection of new funds.\n\nTam always having trouble like that caused by this new mutual fund study.

This may be my last talk to char-\nitable foundations.\n\nNow, toss in with febezzlement in investment management about $750 billion in floating, ever-growing, ever-renewing wealth\nfrom employee stock options, and you get lot more common stock-related wealth effect driving consumption, with some of the\nwealth effect from employee stock options being, in substance, febezzle effect, facilitated by the corrupt accounting practice now\nrequired by standard practice.\n\nNext, consider that each 100-point advance in the S & P adds about $1 trillion in stock market value, and throw in some sort of\nKeynesian-type multiplier effect related to all febezzlement. The related macroeconomic wealth effects, I believe, become much\nlarger than is conventionally supposed.\n\nAnd aggregate wealth effect from stock prices can get very large indeed. It is an unfortunate fact that great and foolish excess\ncan come into prices of common stocks in the aggregate. They are valued partly like bonds, based on roughly rational projections\nof use value in producing future cash. But they are also valued partly like Rembrandt paintings, purchased mostly because their\nprices have gone up so far. This situation, combined with big wealth effects, at first up and later down, can conceivably produce\nmuch mischief.\n\nLet us try to investigate this by a thought experiment. One of the big British pension funds once bought a lot of ancient art,\nplanning to sell it 10 years later, which it did, at a modest profit. Suppose all pension funds purchased ancient art, and only ancient\nart, with all their assets. Wouldn\u2019t we eventually have a terrible mess on our hands, with great and undesirable macroeconomic\nconsequences? And wouldn't the mess be bad if only half of all pension funds were invested in ancient art? And if half of all stock\nvalue became a consequence of mania, isn\u2019t the situation much like the case wherein half of pension assets are ancient art?\n\nMy foregoing acceptance of the possibility that stock value in aggregate can become irrationally high is contrary to the hard-\nform efficient-market theory that many of you once learned as gospel from your mistaken professors of yore. Your mistaken pro-\nfessors were too much influenced by \u201crational man\u201d models of human behavior from economics and too little by \u201cfoolish man\u201d\n\nmodels from psychology and real-world experience.

If I am at all right, our present prosperity has hada\nstronger boost from common stock price-related wealth effects, some of them disgusting, than has been the case in many former\nbooms. If so, what was greater on the upside in the recent boom could also be greater on the downside at some time of future\nstock price decline. Incidentally, the economists may well conclude, eventually, that when stock market advances and declines are\nregarded as long-lasting, there is more downside force on optional consumption per dollar of stock market decline than there is\nupside force per dollar of stock market rise. I suspect that economists would believe this already if they were more willing to take\nassistance from the best ideas outside their own discipline, or even to look harder at Japan.\n\nRemembering Japan, I also want to raise the possibility that there are, in the very long term, virtue effects in economics\u2014for\ninstance, that widespread corrupt accounting will eventually create bad long-term consequences as a sort of obverse effect from\nthe virtue-based boost double-entry bookkeeping gave to the heyday of Venice. I suggest that when the financial scene starts re-\nminding you of Sodom and Gomorrah, you should fear practical consequences even if you like to participate in what is going on.\n\nFinally, I believe that the implications for charitable foundations of my conclusions today, combined with the conclusions in\nmy former talk to foundation financial officers, go way beyond implications for investment techniques. If I am right, almost all US\nfoundations are unwise through failure to understand their own investment operations related to the larger system. If so, this is\nnot good. A rough rule in life is that an organization foolish in one way in dealing with a complex system is all too likely to be fool-\nish in another. So the wisdom of foundation donations may need as much improvement as investment practices of foundations.\nAnd here we have two more old rules to guide us. One rule is ethical, and the other is prudential.\n\nThe ethical rule is from Samuel Johnson, who believed that maintenance of easily removable ignorance by a responsible\nofficeholder was treacherous malfeasance in meeting moral obligation.

But, as nearly as I can tell, there has been absolutely no theoretical reaction from anyone who heard\n\nor read the talk. I still believe everything I said about significant macro-economic effects from febezzlement through excessive in-\n\nvestment costs. But no one trained in economics has ever tried to engage with me on this subject.\n\nUndeterred by this apathy, I am now going to push my reasoning one notch further by laying out a thought experiment extrap-\nolating the combined reasoning of Talks Six and Seven to an assumed higher level of investment costs.\n\nAssume that 2006 stock prices rise by 200 percent while corporate earnings do not rise, at which point all the sensibly dis-\ntributable earnings of all US corporations combined amount to less than the total of all stockholder investment costs, because such\ncosts rise proportionally with stock prices.\n\nNow, so long as this situation continues, no money at all, net of investment costs, is going out of all corporations to all corporate\nowners combined. Instead, frictional cost imposers get more than all sensibly distributable corporate earnings. And at the end of\nany year, the corporate owners in aggregate can get money by reason of their stockholding only by making stock sales to providers\nof \u201cnew money,\u201d who, considering high continuing investment costs for themselves and others, must expect that stock prices will\nkeep rising indefinitely while all stock owners, combined, are getting nothing, net, except by selling stock to more new money.\n\nTo many imposers of frictional investment costs, this peculiar state of affairs would seem ideal, with more than 100 percent of\nsensibly distributable corporate earnings going to precisely the right sort of people, instead of being wasted on the shareholders.\n\nAnd some economists would regard the result as good because it came about in a market.

F. Braun Engineering, a firm whose brilliant founder, Carl\nF. Braun, and business practices Charlie greatly admired. (The firm was ultimately sold to the Kuwaiti government,\n\nso the later Quant Tech is not modeled in any way on C. F.

Well ..\n\n \n\nThe great financial scandal erupted in 2003 with the sudden, deserved disgrace of Quant Technical Corporation, always called\nQuant Tech. By this time, Quant Tech was the country\u2019s largest pure engineering firm, having become so as a consequence of the\ncontributions of its legendary founder, engineer Albert Berzog Quant.\n\nAfter 2003, people came to see the Quant Tech story as a sort of morality play divided into two acts. Act I, the era of the great\nfounding engineer, was seen as a golden age of sound values. Act II, the era of the founder\u2019s immediate successors, was seen as the\nage of false values, with Quant Tech becoming, in the end, a sort of latter-day Sodom or Gomorrah.\n\nIn fact, as this account will make clear, the change from good to evil did not occur all at once when Quant Tech's founder died in\n1982. Much good continued after 1982, and serious evil had existed for many years prior to 1982 in the financial culture in which\nQuant Tech had to operate.\n\nThe Quant Tech story is best understood as a classic sort of tragedy in which a single flaw is inexorably punished by remorseless\nFate. The flaw was the country\u2019s amazingly peculiar accounting treatment for employee stock options. The victims were Quant\n\nTech and its country. The history of the Great Financial Scandal, as it actually happened, could have been written by Sophocles.~\n\f"}, "003971.png": {"text": "As his life ended in 1982, Albert Berzog Quant delivered to his successors and his Maker a wonderfully prosperous and useful\ncompany. The sole business of Quant Tech was designing, for fees, all over the world, a novel type of superclean and superefficient\nsmall power plant that improved electricity generation.\n\nBy 1982, Quant Tech had a dominant market share in its business and was earning $100 million on revenues of $1 billion. Its\ncosts were virtually all costs to compensate technical employees engaged in design work. Direct employee compensation cost\namounted to 70 percent of revenues. Of this 70 percent, 30 percent was base salaries and 40 percent was incentive bonuses being\npaid out under an elaborate system designed by the founder. All compensation was paid in cash. There were no stock options be-\ncause the old man considered the accounting treatment required for stock options to be \u201cweak, corrupt, and contemptible,\u201d and he\nno more wanted bad accounting in his business than he wanted bad engineering. Moreover, the old man believed in tailoring his\nhuge incentive bonuses to precise performance standards established for individuals or small groups instead of allowing what he\nconsidered undesirable compensation outcomes, both high and low, such as he believed occurred under other companies\u2019 stock\noption plans.\n\nYet even under the old man\u2019s system, most of Quant Tech\u2019s devoted longtime employees were becoming rich, or sure to get rich.\nThis was happening because the employees were buying Quant Tech stock in the market, just like nonemployee shareholders. The\nold man had always figured that people smart enough and self-disciplined enough to design power plants could reasonably be ex-\npected to take care of their own financial affairs in this way. He would sometimes advise an employee to buy Quant Tech stock, but\nmore paternalistic than that he would not become.\n\nBy the time the founder died in 1982, Quant Tech was debt-free and, except as a reputation enhancer, really didn\u2019t need any\nshareholders\u2019 equity to run its business, no matter how fast revenues grew. However, the old man believed with Ben Franklin that\n\u201cit is hard for an empty sack to stand upright,\u201d and he wanted Quant Tech to stand upright. Moreover, he loved his business and\nhis coworkers, and he always wanted to have on hand large amounts of cash equivalents so as to be able to maximize work-out or\nwork-up chances if an unexpected adversity or opportunity came along. And so, in 1982, Quant Tech had on hand $500 million in\n\ncash equivalents, amounting to 50 percent of revenues.\n\f"}, "003972.png": {"text": "Possessing a strong balance sheet and a productive culture and also holding a critical mass of expertise in a rapidly changing\nand rapidly growing business, Quant Tech, using the old man\u2019s methods, by 1982 was destined for 20 years ahead to maintain\nprofits at 10 percent of revenues while revenues increased at 20 percent per year. After these 20 years, commencing in 2003, Quant\nTech\u2019s profit margin would hold for a very long time at 10 percent while revenue growth would slow down to 4 percent per year.\nBut no one at Quant Tech knew precisely when its inevitable period of slow revenue growth would begin.\n\nThe old man\u2019s dividend policy for Quant Tech was simplicity itself: He never paid a dividend. Instead, all earnings simply piled\nup in cash equivalents.\n\nEvery truly sophisticated investor in common stocks could see that the stock of cash-rich Quant Tech provided a splendid\ninvestment opportunity in 1982, when it sold at a mere 15 times earnings and, despite its brilliant prospects, had a market capi-\ntalization of only $1.5 billion. This low market capitalization, despite brilliant prospects, existed in 1982 because other wonderful\ncommon stocks were also then selling at 15 times earnings or less as a natural consequence of high interest rates then prevailing,\nplus disappointing investment returns that had occurred over many previous years for holders of typical diversified portfolios of\ncommon stocks.\n\nOne result of Quant Tech\u2019s low market capitalization in 1982 was that it made Quant Tech\u2019s directors uneasy and dissatisfied\nright after the old man\u2019s death. A wiser board would then have bought in Quant Tech\u2019s stock very aggressively, using up all cash on\nhand and also borrowing funds to use in the same way. However, such a decision was not in accord with conventional corporate\nwisdom in 1982. And so the directors made a conventional decision. They recruited a new CEO and CFO from outside Quant Tech,\nin particular from a company that had a conventional stock option plan for employees and also possessed a market capitalization\nat 20 times reported earnings, even though its balance sheet was weaker than Quant Tech's and its earnings were growing more\nslowly than earnings at Quant Tech. Incident to the recruitment of the new executives, it was made plain that Quant Tech\u2019s direc-\ntors wanted a higher market capitalization as soon as feasible.\n\nThe newly installed Quant Tech officers quickly realized that the company could not wisely either drive its revenues up at an\n\nannual rate higher than the rate in place or increase Quant Tech\u2019s profit margin.

Therefore, the new officers\nwere attracted to employing what they called \u201cmodern financial engineering,\u201d which required prompt use of any and all ar-\nguably lawful methods for driving up reported earnings, with big, simple changes to be made first.\n\nBy a strange irony of fate, the accounting convention for stock options that had so displeased Quant Tech\u2019s founder now made\nthe new officers\u2019 job very easy, and would ultimately ruin Quant Tech\u2019s reputation. There was now an accounting convention in\nthe United States that, provided employees were first given options, required that when easily marketable stock was issued to\nemployees at a below-market price, the bargain element for the employees, although roughly equivalent to cash, could not count\nas a compensation expense in determining a company\u2019s reported profits. This amazingly peculiar accounting convention had been\nselected by the accounting profession, over the objection of some of its wisest and most ethical members, because corporate man-\nagers, by and large, preferred that their gains from exercising options covering their employers\u2019 stock not be counted as an expense\nin determining their employers\u2019 earnings.\n\nThe accounting profession, in making its amazingly peculiar decision, had simply followed the injunction so often followed\nby persons quite different from prosperous, entrenched accountants. The injunction was that normally followed by insecure and\npowerless people: \u201cWhose bread I eat, his song I sing.\u201d Fortunately, the income tax authorities did not have the same amazingly\npeculiar accounting idea as the accounting profession. Elementary common sense prevailed, and the bargain element in stock op-\ntion exercises was treated as an obvious compensation expense, deductible in determining income for tax purposes.\n\nQuant Tech\u2019s new officers, financially shrewd as they were, could see at a glance that, given the amazingly peculiar accounting\nconvention and the sound income tax rules in place, Quant Tech had a breathtakingly large opportunity to increase its reported\nprofits by taking very simple action. The fact that so large a share of Quant Tech\u2019s annual expense was incentive bonus expense\nprovided a modern financial engineering opportunity second to none.\n\nFor instance, it was mere child\u2019s play for the executives to realize that if in 1982 Quant Tech had substituted employee stock op-\ntion exercise profits for all its incentive bonus expenses of $400 million, while using bonus money saved plus option prices paid to\n\nbuy back all shares issued in option exercises, and keeping all else the same, the result would have been to drive Quant Tech\u2019s 1982\n\f"}, "003974.png": {"text": "reported earnings up by 400 percent, to $500 million from $100 million, while shares outstanding remained exactly the same!\nAnd so it seemed that the obviously correct ploy for the officers was to start substituting employee stock option exercise profits for\nincentive bonuses. Why should a group of numerate engineers care whether their bonuses were in cash or virtually perfect equiv-\nalents of cash? Arranging such substitutions, on any schedule desired, seemed like no difficult chore.\n\nHowever, it was also mere child\u2019s play for the new officers to realize that a certain amount of caution and restraint would be\ndesirable in pushing their new ploy. Obviously, if they pushed their new ploy too hard in any single year, there might be rebellion\nfrom Quant Tech\u2019s accountants or undesirable hostility from other sources. This, in turn, would risk killing a goose with a vast\nability to deliver golden eggs, at least to the officers. After all, it was quite clear that their ploy would be increasing reported earn-\nings only by adding to real earnings an element of phony earnings\u2014phony in the sense that Quant Tech would enjoy no true favor-\nable economic effect (except a temporary fraud-type effect similar to that from overcounting closing inventory) from that part of\nreported earnings increases attributable to use of the ploy. The new CEO privately called the desirable, cautious approach \u201cwisely\nrestrained falsehood.\u201d\n\nPlainly, the new officers saw, it would be prudent to shift bonus payments to employee stock option exercise profits in only a\nmoderate amount per year over many years ahead. They privately called the prudent plan they adopted their \u201cdollop-by-dollop\nsystem,\u201d which they believed had four obvious advantages:\n\nFirst, a moderate dollop of phony earnings in any single year would be less likely to be noticed than a large dollop.\n\nSecond, the large long-term effect from accumulating many moderate dollops of phony earnings over the years would also tend\nto be obscured in the dollop-by-dollop system. As the CFO pithily and privately said, \u201cIf we mix only a moderate minority share of\nturds with the raisins each year, probably no one will recognize what will ultimately become a very large collection of turds.\u201d\n\nThird, the outside accountants, once they had blessed a few financial statements containing earnings increases, only a minority\nshare of which were phony, would probably find it unendurably embarrassing not to bless new financial statements containing\n\nonly the same phony proportion of reported earnings increases.\n\f"}, "003975.png": {"text": "Fourth, the dollop-by-dollop system would tend to prevent disgrace, or something more seriously harmful, for Quant Tech\u2019s\nofficers. With virtually all corporations except Quant Tech having ever-more liberal stock option plans, the officers could always\nexplain that a moderate dollop of shift toward compensation in option-exercise form was needed to help attract or retain employ-\nees. Indeed, given corporate culture and stock market enthusiasm likely to exist as a consequence of the strange accounting con-\nvention for stock options, this claim would often be true.\n\nWith these four advantages, the dollop-by-dollop system seemed so clearly desirable that it only remained for Quant Tech\u2019s\nofficers to decide how big to make their annual dollops of phony earnings. This decision, too, turned out to be easy. The officers\nfirst decided upon three reasonable conditions they wanted satisfied:\n\nFirst, they wanted to be able to continue their dollop-by-dollop system without major discontinuities for 20 years.\n\nSecond, they wanted Quant Tech\u2019s reported earnings to go up by roughly the same percentage each year throughout the whole\n20 years, because they believed that financial analysts representing institutional investors would value Quant Tech\u2019s stock higher\nif reported annual earnings growth never significantly varied.\n\nThird, to protect credibility for reported earnings, they never wanted to strain the credulity of investors by reporting, even in\ntheir 20th year, that Quant Tech was earning more than 40 percent of revenues from designing power plants.\n\nWith these requirements, the math was easy, given the officers\u2019 assumption that Quant Tech\u2019s non-phony earnings and rev-\nenues were both going to grow at 20 percent per year for 20 years. The officers quickly decided to use their dollop-by-dollop system\nto make Quant Tech\u2019s reported earnings increase by 28 percent per year instead of the 20 percent that would have been reported by\nthe founder.\n\nAnd so, the great scheme of modern financial engineering went forward toward tragedy at Quant Tech. And few disreputable\nschemes of man have ever worked better in achieving what was attempted. Quant Tech\u2019s reported earnings, certified by its ac-\ncountants, increased regularly at 28 percent per year. No one criticized Quant Tech\u2019s financial reporting except a few people widely\nregarded as impractical, overly theoretical, misanthropic cranks. It turned out that the founder\u2019s policy of never paying dividends,\n\nwhich was continued, greatly helped in preserving credibility for Quant Tech\u2019s reports that its earnings were rising steadily at 28\n\f"}, "003976.png": {"text": "percent per year. With cash equivalents on hand so remarkably high, the Pavlovian mere-association effects that so often impair\nreality recognition served well to prevent detection of the phony element in the reported earnings.\n\nIt was therefore natural, after the dollop-by-dollop system had been in place for a few years, for Quant Tech\u2019s officers to yearn to\nhave Quant Tech\u2019s reported earnings per share keep going up at 28 percent per year while cash equivalents grew much faster than\nthey were then growing. This turned out to be a snap. By this time, Quant Tech\u2019s stock was selling at a huge multiple of reported\nearnings, and the officers simply started causing some incremental stock option exercises that were not matched either by reduc-\ntions in cash bonuses paid or by repurchases of Quant Tech's stock.\n\nThis change, the officers easily recognized, was a very helpful revision of their original plan. Not only was detection of the\nphony element in the reported earnings made much more difficult as cash accumulation greatly accelerated, but also a significant\namount of Ponzi scheme or chain-letter effect was being introduced into Quant Tech, with real benefits for present shareholders,\nincluding the officers.\n\nAt this time, the officers also fixed another flaw in their original plan. They saw that as Quant Tech\u2019s reported earnings, contain-\ning an increasing phony element, kept rising at 28 percent, Quant Tech\u2019s income taxes as a percentage of reported pretax earnings\nkept going lower and lower. This plainly increased their chances of attracting undesired questions and criticism. This problem\nwas soon eliminated. Many power plants in foreign nations were built and owned by governments, and it proved easy to get some\nforeign governments to raise Quant Tech's design fees, provided that in each case slightly more than the fee increase was paid back\nin additional income taxes to the foreign government concerned.\n\nFinally, for 2002, Quant Tech reported $16 billion in earnings on $47 billion in revenue that now included a lot more revenue\nfrom interest on cash equivalents than would have been present without net issuances of new stock over the years. Cash equiv-\nalents on hand now amounted to an astounding $85 billion, and somehow it didn\u2019t seem impossible to most investors that a\ncompany virtually drowning in so much cash could be earning the $16 billion it was reporting. The market capitalization of Quant\n\nTech at its peak early in 2003 became $1.4 trillion, about 90 times earnings reported for 2002.\n\f"}, "003977.png": {"text": "However, all man\u2019s desired geometric progressions, if a high rate of growth is chosen, at last come to grief ona finite earth.\n\nAnd the social system for man on earth is fair enough, eventually, that almost all massive cheating ends in disgrace. And in 2003,\nQuant Tech failed in both ways.\n\nBy 2003, Quant Tech\u2019s real earning power was growing at only 4 percent per year after sales growth had slowed to 4 percent.\nThere was now no way for Quant Tech to escape causing a big disappointment for its shareholders, now largely consisting of insti-\ntutional investors. This disappointment triggered a shocking decline in the price of Quant Tech stock, which went down suddenly\nby 50 percent. This price decline, in turn, triggered a careful examination of Quant Tech\u2019s financial reporting practices, which, at\nlong last, convinced nearly everyone that a very large majority of Quant Tech\u2019s reported earnings had long been phony earnings,\nand that massive and deliberate misreporting had gone on for a great many years. This triggered even more price decline for Quant\nTech stock until in mid-2003 the market capitalization of Quant Tech was only $140 billion, down 90 percent from its peak only\nsix months earlier.\n\nA quick 90 percent decline in the price of the stock of such an important company that was previously so widely owned and\nadmired caused immense human suffering, considering the $1.3 trillion in market value that had disappeared.

It soon spread to other corporations, some of which plainly\nhad undesirable financial cultures different from Quant Tech\u2019s only in degree. The public and political hatred, like the behavior\nthat had caused it, soon went to gross excess and fed upon itself. Financial misery spread far beyond investors into a serious reces-\nsion like that of Japan in the 1990s following the long period of false Japanese accounting.\n\nThere was huge public antipathy to professions following the Great Scandal. The accounting profession, of course, got the most\nblame.

Moreover, the unsound\naccounting is more virulent than the murderous construction practice.

The accounting profession now requires that some provision\nfor stock option cost be charged against earnings. However, by the time stock options are exercised, the total cost charged is usu-\nally far less than total cost incurred.

The\ntalk incorporates the many ideas that Charlie discussed in his previous talks and presents them, checklist-style, as\na coherent philosophy.\n\nCharlie\u2019s audience, the economics department of this major university, was the perfect group on which to unleash\n\nthis lament-and remediation proposals besides\u2014about the lack of multidisciplinarianism in the soft sciences.\n\n \n\nIhave outlined some remarks in a rough way, and after I\u2019m finished talking from that outline, I'll take questions as long as anybody\ncan endure listening, until they drag me away to wherever else I\u2019m supposed to go.\n\nAs you might guess, I agreed to do this because the subject of getting the soft sciences so they talk better to each other has been\none that has interested me for decades. And, of course, economics is, in many respects, the queen of the soft sciences. It\u2019s expected\nto be better than the rest. It\u2019s my view that economics is better at the multidisciplinary stuff than the rest of soft science. It\u2019s also\nmy view that it\u2019s still lousy, and I'd like to discuss this failure in this talk.\n\nAs I talk about strengths and weaknesses in academic economics, one interesting fact you are entitled to know is that I never\ntook a course in economics. And with this striking lack of credentials, you may wonder why I have the chutzpah to be up here giv-\ning this talk. The answer is I have a black belt in chutzpah. I was born with it. Some people, like some of the women I know, have a\nblack belt in spending. They were born with that. But what they gave me was a black belt in chutzpah.\n\nIcome from two peculiar strands of experience that may have given me some useful economic insights. One is Berkshire\nHathaway, and the other is my personal educational history. Berkshire, of course, has finally gotten interesting. When Warren\ntook over Berkshire, the market capitalization was about $10 million. Forty-something years later, there are not many more shares\n\noutstanding now than there were then, and the market capitalization is about $100 billion, $10,000 for one. And since that has\n\f"}, "003983.png": {"text": "happened, year after year, in kind of a grind-ahead fashion with very few failures, it eventually drew some attention, indicating\nthat maybe Warren and I knew something useful in microeconomics.\n\nFor a long time, there was a Nobel Prize-winning economist who explained Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s success as follows:\n\nFirst, he said Berkshire beat the market in common stock investing through one sigma of luck because nobody could beat the\nmarket except by luck. This hard-form version of efficient-market theory was taught in most schools of economics at the time.\nPeople were taught that nobody could beat the market. Next, the professor went to two sigmas, and three sigmas, and four sigmas,\nand when he finally got to six sigmas of luck, people were laughing so hard he stopped doing it.\n\nThen, he reversed the explanation 180 degrees. He said, \u201cNo, it was still six sigmas, but it was six sigmas of skill.\u201d Well, this very\nsad history demonstrates the truth of Benjamin Franklin\u2019s observation in Poor Richard\u2019s Almanack: \u201cIf you would persuade, appeal\nto interest and not to reason.\u201d The man changed his silly view when his incentives made him change it and not before.\n\nI watched the same thing happen at the Jules Stein Eye Institute at UCLA. I asked at one point, \u201cWhy are you treating cataracts\nonly with a totally obsolete cataract operation?\u201d And the man said to me, \u201cCharlie, it\u2019s such a wonderful operation to teach.\u201d When\nhe stopped using that operation, it was because almost all the patients had voted with their feet. Again, appeal to interest and not\nto reason if you want to change conclusions.\n\nWell, Berkshire\u2019s whole record has been achieved without paying one ounce of attention to the efficient-market theory in its\nhard form, and not one ounce of attention to the descendants of that idea, which came out of academic economics and went into\ncorporate finance and morphed into such obscenities as the capital asset pricing model, which we also paid no attention to. I think\nyou'd have to believe in the tooth fairy to believe that you could easily outperform the market by 7 percentage points per annum\njust by investing in high-volatility stocks.\n\nYet, believe it or not, like the Jules Stein doctor, people once believed this stuff. And the belief was rewarded, and it spread. And\nmany people still believe it. But Berkshire never paid any attention to it. Now I think the world is coming our way, and the idea of\n\nperfection in all market outcomes is going the way of the dodo.\n\f"}, "003984.png": {"text": "It was always clear to me that the stock market couldn\u2019t be perfectly efficient, because as a teenager I\u2019d been to the racetrack in\nOmaha, where they had the pari-mutuel system. And it was quite obvious to me that if the house take, the croupier\u2019s take, was 17\npercent, some people consistently lost a lot less than 17 percent of all their bets and other people consistently lost more than 17\npercent of all their bets. So the pari-mutuel system in Omaha had no perfect efficiency. And so I didn\u2019t accept the argument that\nthe stock market was always perfectly efficient in creating rational prices.\n\nIndeed, there have been some documented cases since of people getting so good at understanding horses and odds that they\nactually are able to beat the house in offtrack betting. There aren\u2019t many people who can do that, but there are a few people in\nAmerica who can.\n\nNext, my personal education history is interesting because its deficiencies and my peculiarities eventually created advantages.\nFor some odd reason, I had an early and extreme multidisciplinary cast of mind. I couldn't stand reaching for a small idea in my\nown discipline when there was a big idea right over the fence in somebody else\u2019s discipline. So I just grabbed in all directions for the\nbig ideas that would really work. Nobody taught me to do that; I was just born with that yen.\n\nTalso was born with a huge craving for synthesis. And when it didn\u2019t come easily, which was often, I would rag the problem, and\nthen, when I failed, I would put it aside, and I\u2019d come back to it and rag it again. It took me 20 years to figure out how and why cult\nconversion methods worked. But the psychology departments haven't figured it out yet, so I\u2019m ahead of them.\n\nBut anyway, I have this tendency to want to rag the problems. Because WWII caught me, I drifted into some physics, and the Air\nCorps sent me to Caltech, where I did a little more physics as part of being made into a meteorologist. And there, at a very young\nage, I absorbed what I call the fundamental full attribution ethos of hard science. That was enormously useful to me. Let me ex-\nplain that ethos.\n\nUnder this ethos, you\u2019ve got to know all the big ideas in all the disciplines more fundamental than your own. You can never\nmake any explanation that can be made in a more fundamental way in any other way than the most fundamental way. And you\nalways take them with full attribution to the most fundamental ideas that you are required to use. When you're using physics,\n\nyou say you're using physics. When you\u2019re using biology, you say you're using biology. And so on and so on. I could early see that\n\f"}, "003985.png": {"text": "that ethos would act as a fine organizing system for my thought. And I strongly suspected that it would work really well in the soft\nsciences as well as the hard sciences, so I just grabbed it and used it all through my life in soft science as well as hard science. That\nwas a very lucky idea for me.\n\nLet me explain how extreme that ethos is in hard science. There is a constant, one of the fundamental constants in physics,\nknown as Boltzmann's constant.\u201d You probably all know it very well. The interesting thing about Boltzmann\u2019s constant is that\n[Ludwig] Boltzmann didn\u2019t discover it. So why is Boltzmann\u2019s constant now named for Boltzmann? Well, the answer is that Boltz-\nmann derived that constant from basic physics in a more fundamental way than the poor forgotten fellow who found the constant\nin the first place in some less fundamental way.\n\nThe ethos of hard science is so strong in favor of reductionism to the more fundamental body of knowledge that you can wash\nthe discoverer right out of history when somebody else handles his discovery in a more fundamental way. I think that is correct. I\nthink Boltzmann's constant should be named for Boltzmann.\n\nAt any rate, in my history and Berkshire\u2019s history, Berkshire went on and on into considerable economic success while ignoring\nthe hard-form efficient-markets doctrine once very popular in academic economics and ignoring the descendants of that doctrine\nin corporate finance, where the results became even sillier than they were in economics. This naturally encouraged me.\n\nFinally, with my peculiar history, I\u2019m also bold enough to be here today because, at least when I was young, I wasn\u2019t a total klutz.\nFor one year at the Harvard Law School, I was ranked second in a very large group, and I always figured that, while there were al-\nways a lot of people much smarter than I was, I didn\u2019t have to hang back totally in the thinking game.\n\nLet me begin by discussing the obvious strengths of academic economics. The first obvious strength\u2014and this is true of a lot\nof places that get repute\u2014is that it was in the right place at the right time. Two hundred years ago, aided by the growth of tech-\nnology and the growth of other developments in civilization, the real output per capita of the civilized world started going up at\nabout 2 percent per annum, compounded. Before that, for the previous thousands of years, it had gone up at a rate that hovered\njust a hair\u2019s breadth above zero. And, of course, economics grew up amid this huge success. Partly it helped the success, and partly\n\nit explained it. So, naturally, academic economics grew. And lately, with the collapse of all the communist economies, as the free-\n\f"}, "003986.png": {"text": "market economies or partially free-market economies flourished, that added to the reputation of economics. Economics has been a\nvery favorable place to be if you're in academia.\n\nEconomics was always more multidisciplinary than the rest of soft science. It just reached out and grabbed things as it needed\nto. And that tendency to just grab whatever you need from the rest of knowledge if you\u2019re an economist has reached a fairly high\npoint in N. Gregory Mankiw\u2019s~ new textbook.\n\nI checked out that textbook. I must have been one of the few businessmen in America who bought it immediately when it came\nout because it had gotten such a big advance. I wanted to figure out what the guy was doing where he could get an advance that\ngreat. So this is how I happened to riffle through Mankiw\u2019s freshman textbook. And there I found laid out as principles of econom-\nics: Opportunity cost is a superpower, to be used by all people who have any hope of getting the right answer. Also, incentives are\nsuperpowers. And lastly, the tragedy of the commons model, popularized by my longtime friend, UCSB\u2019s Garrett Hardin.\u201c Hardin\ncaused the delightful introduction into economics, alongside Smith's beneficent invisible hand, of Hardin\u2019s wicked, evildoing in-\nvisible foot. Well, I thought that the Hardin model made economics more complete, and I knew when Hardin introduced me to his\nmodel, the tragedy of the commons, that it would be in the economics textbooks eventually. And lo and behold, it finally made it\nabout 20 years later. And it\u2019s right for Mankiw to reach out into other disciplines and grab Hardin\u2019s model, and anything else that\nworks well.\n\nAnother thing that helped economics is that, from the beginning, it attracted the best brains in soft science. Its denizens also\ninteracted more with the practical world than was at all common in soft science and the rest of academia, and that resulted in very\ncreditable outcomes like the three Cabinet appointments of economics PhD George Shultz\u2122 and the Cabinet appointment of Larry\nSummers. So this has been a very favored part of academia.\n\nAlso, economics early on attracted some of the best writers of language in the history of the earth. You start out with Adam\nSmith. Adam Smith was so good a thinker and so good a writer that, in his own time, Immanuel Kant, then the greatest intellec-\n\ntual in Germany, simply announced that there was nobody in Germany to equal Adam Smith. Well, Voltaire, being an even pithier\n\f"}, "003987.png": {"text": "speaker than Kant, which wouldn\u2019t be that hard, immediately said, \u201cOh, well, France doesn\u2019t have anybody who can even be com-\npared to Adam Smith.\u201d\n\nSo economics started with some very great men and great writers. And then there have been later great writers like John\nMaynard Keynes, whom I quote all the time and who has added a great amount of illumination to my life. And finally, even in the\npresent era, if you take Paul Krugman and read his essays, you will be impressed by his fluency. I can\u2019t stand his politics; \u2019m on\nthe other side. But I love this man\u2019s essays. I think Paul Krugman is one of the best essayists alive. So economics has constantly at-\ntracted these fabulous writers. And they are so good that they have this enormous influence far outside their economic discipline,\nand that\u2019s very uncommon in other academic departments.\n\nOkay, now it\u2019s time to extend criticism instead of praise. We've recognized that economics is better than other soft science\nacademic departments in many ways, and one of the glories of civilization. Now it\u2019s only fair that we outline a few things that are\n\nwrong with academic economics.\n\nONE\n\nFatal unconnectedness, leading to man-with-a-hammer syndrome, often causing overweighing of what can\n\nbe counted\n\nI think I\u2019ve got eight\u2014no, nine\u2014objections, some being logical subdivisions of a big general objection. The big general objection to\neconomics was the one early described by Alfred North Whitehead when he spoke of the fatal unconnectedness of academic disci-\nplines, wherein each professor didn\u2019t even know the models of the other disciplines, much less try to synthesize those disciplines\n\nwith his own. I think there\u2019s a modern name for this approach that Whitehead didn\u2019t like, and that name is \u201cbonkers.\u201d This is a per-\n\nfectly crazy way to behave. Yet economics, like much else in academia, is too insular.\n\f"}, "003988.png": {"text": "The nature of this failure is that it creates what I always call man-with-a-hammer syndrome. That\u2019s taken from the folk saying\n\u201cTo the man with only a hammer, every problem looks pretty much like a nail.\u201d That works marvelously to gum up all professions\nand all departments of academia and, indeed, most practical life.\n\nThe only antidote for being an absolute klutz due to the presence of a man-with-a-hammer syndrome is to have a full kit of\ntools. You don\u2019t have just a hammer, you've got all the tools. And you've got to have one more trick: You've got to use those tools\nchecklist-style, because you'll miss a lot if you just hope that the right tool is going to pop up unaided whenever you need it. But if.\nyou've got a full list of tools and go through them in your mind, checklist-style, you will find a lot of answers that you won't find\nany other way. So limiting this big general objection that so disturbed Alfred North Whitehead is very important, and there are\nmental tricks that help do the job.\n\nA special version of this man-with-a-hammer syndrome is terrible not only in economics but practically everywhere else,\nincluding business. It\u2019s really terrible in business. You've got a complex system, and it spews out a lot of wonderful numbers that\nenable you to measure some factors. But there are other factors that are terribly important, yet there\u2019s no precise numbering you\ncan put to these factors. You know they\u2019re important, but you don\u2019t have the numbers. Well, practically everybody 1) overweighs\nthe stuff that can be numbered because it yields to the statistical techniques they\u2019re taught in academia, and 2) doesn\u2019t mix in the\nhard-to-measure stuff that may be more important. That is a mistake I\u2019ve tried all my life to avoid, and I have no regrets for having\ndone that.\n\nThe late, great Thomas Hunt Morgan, who was one of the greatest biologists who ever lived, when he got to Caltech hada\nvery interesting, extreme way of avoiding some mistakes from overcounting what could be measured and undercounting what\ncouldn't. At that time, there were no computers, and the computer substitute then available to science and engineering was the\nFriden calculator, and Caltech was full of Friden calculators. Thomas Hunt Morgan banned the Friden calculator from the biology\ndepartment. And when they said, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Dr. Morgan?,\u201d he said, \u201cWell, Iam like a guy who is prospecting for\ngold along the banks of the Sacramento River in 1849. With a little intelligence, I can reach down and pick up big nuggets of gold.\n\f"}, "003989.png": {"text": "Andas long as I can do that, I\u2019m not going to let any people in my department waste scarce resources in placer mining.~ And that\u2019s\nthe way Thomas Hunt Morgan got through life.\n\nI\u2019ve adopted the same technique, and here I am in my 80th year. I haven\u2019t had to do any placer mining yet. And it begins to look\nlike I\u2019m going to get all the way through, as I'd always hoped, without doing any of that damned placer mining. Of course, if I were\na physician, particularly an academic physician, I\u2019d have to do the statistics, do the placer mining. But it\u2019s amazing what you can do\nin life without the placer mining if you've got a few good mental tricks and just keep ragging the problems the way Thomas Hunt\n\nMorgan did.\n\nTWO\n\nFailure to follow the fundamental full-attribution ethos of hard science\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with the way Mankiw does economics is that he grabs from other disciplines without attribution. He doesn\u2019t label\nthe grabbed items as physics or biology or psychology or game theory or whatever they really are, fully attributing the concept to\nthe basic knowledge from which it came. If you don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s like running a business with a sloppy filing system. It reduces\nyour power to be as good as you can be.\n\nNow, Mankiw is so smart he does pretty well even when his technique is imperfect. He got the largest advance any textbook\nwriter ever got. But nonetheless, he\u2019d be better if he had absorbed a hard-science ethos, which has been helpful to me.\n\nIhave names for Mankiw\u2019s approach, grabbing whatever you need without attribution. Sometimes I call it \u201ctake what you\nwish,\u201d and sometimes I call it \u201cKiplingism.\u201d And when I call it Kiplingism, I\u2019m reminding you of [Joseph Rudyard] Kipling\u2019s~ stanza\nof poetry, which went something like this: \u201cWhen Homer smote his blooming lyre, he\u2019d heard men sing by land and sea, and what\n\nhe thought he might require, he went and took, the same as me.\u201d\n\f"}, "003990.png": {"text": "Well, that\u2019s the way Mankiw does it. He just grabs. This is much better than not grabbing. But it is much worse than grabbing\n\nwith full attribution and full discipline, using all knowledge plus extreme reductionism where feasible.\n\nTHREE\n\nPhysics envy\n\nThe third weakness that I find in economics is what I call physics envy. And, of course, that term has been borrowed from \u201cpenis\nenvy,\u201d as described by one of the world\u2019s great idiots, Sigmund Freud. But he was very popular in his time, and the concept got a\nwide vogue.\n\nOne of the worst examples of what physics envy did to economics was cause adoption of hard-form efficient-market theory.\nThen, when you logically derived consequences from this wrong theory, you would get conclusions such as it can never be correct\nfor any corporation to buy its own stock. Because the stock price, by definition, is totally efficient, there could never be any advan-\ntage, QED. And they taught this theory to some partner at McKinsey when he was at some school of business that had adopted this\ncrazy line of reasoning from economics, and the partner became a paid consultant for The Washington Post. And Washington Post\nstock was selling at a fifth of what an orangutan could figure was the plain value per share by just counting up the values and di-\nviding. But he so believed what he\u2019d been taught in graduate school that he told The Washington Post it shouldn\u2019t buy its own stock.\n\nWell, fortunately, they put Warren Buffett on the board, and he convinced them to buy back more than half of the outstanding\nstock, which enriched the remaining shareholders by much more than a billion dollars. So there was at least one instance of a place\nthat quickly killed a wrong academic theory.\n\nIt\u2019s my view that economics could avoid a lot of this trouble that comes from physics envy. I want economics to pick up the\nbasic ethos of hard science, the full attribution habit, but not the craving for an unattainable precision that comes from physics\n\nenvy. The sort of precise, reliable formula that includes Boltzmann\u2019s constant is not going to happen, by and large, in economics.\n\f"}, "003991.png": {"text": "Economics involves too complex a system. And the craving for that physics-style precision does little but get you in terrible trou-\nble, like the poor fool from McKinsey.\n\nI think that economists would be way better off if they paid more attention to Einstein and Sharon Stone. Well, Einstein is easy\nbecause Einstein is famous for saying \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no more simple.\u201d Now, the saying is a\ntautology, but it\u2019s very useful, and some economist\u2014it may have been Herb Stein\u2014had a similar tautological saying that I dearly\nlove: \u201cIf a thing can\u2019t go on forever, it will eventually stop.\u201d\n\nSharon Stone contributed to the subject because someone once asked her if she was bothered by penis envy. And she said, \u201cAb-\nsolutely not. I have more trouble than I can handle with what I\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nWhen I talk about this false precision, this great hope for reliable, precise formulas, I am reminded of Arthur Laffer, who's in my\npolitical party, and who takes a mistaken approach, sometimes, when it comes to doing economics. His trouble is his craving for\nfalse precision, which is not an adult way of dealing with his subject matter.\n\nThe situation of people like Laffer reminds me of a rustic legislator\u2014and this really happened in America. I don\u2019t invent these\nstories. Reality is always more ridiculous than what I\u2019m going to tell you. At any rate, this rustic legislator proposed a new law in\nhis state. He wanted to pass a law rounding pi to an even 3.2 so it would be easier for the schoolchildren to make the computations.\n\nWell, you can say that this is too ridiculous, and it can\u2019t be fair to liken economics professors like Laffer to a rustic legislator\nlike this. I say I\u2019m under-criticizing the professors. At least when this rustic legislator rounded pi to an even number, the error was\nrelatively small. But once you try to put a lot of false precision into a complex system like economics, the errors can compound\nto the point where they\u2019re worse than those of the McKinsey partner when he was incompetently advising The Washington Post.\nSo economics should emulate physics\u2019 basic ethos, but its search for precision in physics-like formulas is almost always wrong in\n\neconomics.\n\f"}, "003992.png": {"text": "FOUR\n\nToo much emphasis on macroeconomics\n\nMy fourth criticism is that there\u2019s too much emphasis on macroeconomics and not enough on microeconomics. I think this is\nwrong. It\u2019s like trying to master medicine without knowing anatomy and chemistry. Also, the discipline of microeconomics is a lot\nof fun. It helps you correctly understand macroeconomics, and it\u2019s a perfect circus to do. In contrast, I don\u2019t think macroeconomics\npeople have all that much fun. For one thing, they are often wrong because of extreme complexity in the system they wish to\nunderstand.\n\nLet me demonstrate the power of microeconomics by solving two microeconomic problems, one simple and one a little harder.\n\nThe first problem is this: Berkshire Hathaway just opened a furniture and appliance store in Kansas City, Kansas. At the time\nBerkshire opened it, the largest-selling furniture and appliance store in the world was another Berkshire Hathaway store selling\n$350 million worth of goods per year. The new store in a strange city opened up selling at the rate of more than $500 million a\nyear. From the day it opened, the 3,200 spaces in the parking lot were full. The women had to wait outside the ladies\u2019 restroom be-\ncause the architects didn\u2019t understand biology. It\u2019s hugely successful.\n\nWell, I\u2019ve given you the problem. Now, tell me what explains the runaway success of this new furniture and appliance store that\nis outselling everything else in the world.\n\nLet me do it for you. Is this a low-priced store or a high-priced store? It\u2019s not going to have runaway success in a strange city as\na high-priced store. That would take time. Number two, if it\u2019s moving $500 million worth of furniture through it, it\u2019s one hell of a\nbig store, furniture being as bulky as it is. And what does a big store do? It provides a big selection. So what could this possibly be\n\nexcept a low-priced store with a big selection?\n\f"}, "003993.png": {"text": "But you may wonder, why wasn\u2019t it done before, preventing its being done first now? Again, the answer just pops into your\nhead: It costs a fortune to open a store this big, so nobody\u2019s done it before. So you quickly know the answer. With a few basic con-\ncepts, these microeconomic problems that seem hard can be solved much as you put a hot knife through butter. I like such easy\nways of thought that are very remunerative. And I suggest that you people should also learn to do microeconomics better.\n\nNow I'll give you a harder problem. There\u2019s a tire store chain in the Northwest that has slowly succeeded over 50 years, the Les\nSchwab\u201c tire store chain. It just ground ahead. It started competing with the stores that were owned by the big tire companies\nthat made all the tires, the Goodyears and so forth. And, of course, the manufacturers favored their own stores. Their \u201ctied stores\u201d\nhad a big cost advantage. Later, Les Schwab rose in competition with the huge price discounters like Costco and Sam\u2019s Club and\nbefore that Sears, Roebuck and so forth. And yet, here is Schwab now, with hundreds of millions of dollars in sales. And here\u2019s Les\nSchwab in his 80s, with no education, having done the whole thing.\n\nHow did he do it? I don\u2019t see a whole lot of people looking like a light bulb has come on. Well, let\u2019s think about it with some\nmicroeconomic fluency.\n\nIs there some wave that Schwab could have caught? The minute you ask the question, the answer pops in. The Japanese hada\nzero position in tires, and they got big. So this guy must have ridden that wave some in the early times. Then, the slow following\nsuccess has to have some other causes. And what probably happened here, obviously, is this guy did one hell of a lot of things right.\nAnd among the things that he must have done right is he must have harnessed what Mankiw calls the superpower of incentives.\nHe must have a very clever incentive structure driving his people. And a clever personnel selection system, etc. And he must be\npretty good at advertising. Which he is. He\u2019s an artist.\n\nSo he had to get a wave in the Japanese tire invasion, the Japanese being as successful as they were. And then a talented fanatic\nhad to get a hell of a lot of things right and keep them right with clever systems. Again, not that hard of an answer. But what else\nwould be a likely cause of the peculiar success?\n\nWe hire business school graduates, and they\u2019re no better at these problems than you were. Maybe that\u2019s the reason we hire so\n\nfew of them.\n\f"}, "003994.png": {"text": "Well, how did I solve those problems? Obviously, I was using a simple search engine in my mind to go through checklist-style,\nand I was using some rough algorithms that work pretty well in a great many complex systems, and those algorithms run some-\nthing like this:\n\nExtreme success is likely to be caused by some combination of the following factors:\n\n1. Extreme maximization or minimization of one or two variables. Example, Costco or our furniture and appliance store.\n\n2. Adding success factors so that a bigger combination drives success, often in nonlinear fashion, as one is reminded by the\nconcept of breakpoint and the concept of critical mass in physics. Often, results are not linear. You get a little bit more mass\nand you get a lollapalooza result. And, of course, I\u2019ve been searching for lollapalooza results all my life, so I\u2019m very interested\nin models that explain their occurrence.\n\n3. An extreme of good performance over many factors. Example, Toyota or Les Schwab.\n\n4, Catching and riding some sort of big wave. Example, Oracle. By the way, I cited Oracle before I knew that the Oracle CFO [Jeff\n\nHenley] was a big part of the proceedings here today.\n\nGenerally, I recommend and use in problem-solving cut-to-the-quick algorithms, and I find you have to use them both forward\nand backward. Let me give you an example. I irritate my family by giving them little puzzles, and one of the puzzles that I gave my\nfamily not very long ago was when I said, \u201cThere\u2019s an activity in America with one-on-one contests and a national championship.\nThe same person won the championship on two occasions about 65 years apart. Now,\u201d I said, \u201cname the activity.\u201d\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t see a lot of light bulbs going on. And in my family, not a lot of light bulbs were flashing. But I have a physicist son\nwho has been trained more in the type of thinking I like. And he immediately got the right answer, and here\u2019s the way he reasoned:\nIt can\u2019t be anything requiring a lot of hand-eye coordination. Nobody 85 years of age is going to win a national billiards tourna-\n\nment, much less a national tennis tournament. It just can\u2019t be. Then he figured it couldn\u2019t be chess, which this physicist plays very\n\f"}, "003995.png": {"text": "well, because it\u2019s too hard. The complexity of the system and the stamina required are too great. But that led into checkers. And he\nthought, \u201cAha! There\u2019s a game where vast experience might guide you to be the best even though you're 85 years of age.\u201d\nAnyway, I recommend that sort of mental puzzle-solving to all of you, flipping one\u2019s thinking both backward and forward. And\n\nIrecommend that academic economics get better at very small-scale microeconomics as demonstrated here.\n\nFIVE\n\nToo little synthesis in economics\n\nMy fifth criticism is there is too little synthesis in economics, not only with matter outside traditional economics but also within\neconomics.\n\nIhave posed before two different business school classes the following problem. I say, \u201cYou have studied supply and demand\ncurves. You have learned that when you raise the price, ordinarily the volume you can sell goes down, and when you reduce the\nprice, the volume you can sell goes up. Is that right? That\u2019s what you've learned?\u201d They all nod yes. And I say, \u201cNow tell me several\ninstances when, if you want the physical volume to go up, the correct answer is to increase the price.\u201d And there\u2019s this long and\nghastly pause. And finally, in each of the two business schools in which I\u2019ve tried this, maybe one person in 50 could name one\ninstance. They come up with the idea that under certain circumstances, a higher price acts as a rough indicator of quality and\nthereby increases sales volumes.\n\nThis happened in the case of my friend Bill Ballhaus. When he was head of Beckman Instruments, it produced some compli-\ncated product where if it failed, it caused enormous damage to the purchaser. It wasn\u2019t a pump at the bottom of an oil well, but\nthat\u2019s a good mental example. And he realized that the reason this thing was selling so poorly, even though it was better than any-\nbody else\u2019s product, was because it was priced lower. It made people think it was a low-quality gizmo. So he raised the price by 20\n\npercent or so, and the volume went way up.\n\f"}, "003996.png": {"text": "But only one in 50 can come up with this sole instance in a modern business school\u2014one of the business schools being Stan-\nford, which is hard to get into. And nobody has yet come up with the main answer that I like. Suppose you raise that price and use\nthe extra money to bribe the other guy\u2019s purchasing agent? Is that going to work? And are there functional equivalents in econom-\nics, microeconomics, of raising the price and using the extra sales proceeds to drive sales higher? And, of course, there are a zillion,\nonce you've made that mental jump. It\u2019s so simple.\n\nOne of the most extreme examples is in the investment management field. Suppose you're the manager of a mutual fund, and\nyou want to sell more. People commonly come to the following answer: You raise the commissions, which, of course, reduces the\nnumber of units of real investments delivered to the ultimate buyer, so you're increasing the price per unit of real investment that\nyou're selling the ultimate customer. And you're using that extra commission to bribe the customer\u2019s purchasing agent. You're\nbribing the broker to betray his client and put the client\u2019s money into the high-commission product. This has worked to produce at\nleast a trillion dollars of mutual fund sales.\n\nThis tactic is not an attractive part of human nature, and I want to tell you that I pretty completely avoided it in my life. I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s necessary to spend your life selling what you would never buy. Even though it\u2019s legal, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea. But you\nshouldn't accept all my notions, because you'll risk becoming unemployable. You shouldn't take my notions unless you're willing\nto risk being unemployable by all but a few.\n\nI think my experience with my simple question is an example of how little synthesis people get, even in advanced academic\nsettings, considering economic questions. Obvious questions, with such obvious answers. Yet people take four courses in econom-\nics, go to business school, have all these IQ points, and write all these essays, but they can\u2019t synthesize worth a damn.\n\nThis failure is not because the professors know all this stuff and they\u2019re deliberately withholding it from the students. This\nfailure happens because the professors aren\u2019t all that good at this kind of synthesis. They were trained in a different way. I can\u2019t\nremember if it was Keynes or Galbraith who said that economics professors are most economical with ideas. They make a few they\n\nlearned in graduate school last a lifetime.\n\f"}, "003997.png": {"text": "The second interesting problem with synthesis involves two of the most famous examples in economics. Number one is [David]\nRicardo\u2019s~ principle of comparative advantage in trade, and the other is Adam Smith's pin factory. And both of these, of course,\nwork to vastly increase economic output per person, and they\u2019re similar in that each somehow directs functions into the hands of\npeople who are very good at doing the functions. Yet they\u2019re radically different examples in that one of them is the ultimate exam-\nple of central planning\u2014the pin factory\u2014where the whole system was planned by somebody, while the other example, Ricardo\u2019s,\nhappens automatically as a natural consequence of trade.\n\nAnd, of course, once you get into the joys of synthesis, you immediately think, \u201cDo these things interact?\u201d Of course they inter-\nact. Beautifully. And that\u2019s one of the causes of the power of a modern economic system.\n\nI saw an example of that kind of interaction years ago. Berkshire had this former savings and loan company, and it had made\nthis loan on a hotel right opposite the Hollywood Park Racetrack. In due time, the neighborhood changed, and it was full of gangs,\npimps, and dope dealers. They tore copper pipe out of the wall for dope fixes, and there were people hanging around the hotel with\nguns, and nobody would come. We foreclosed on it two or three times, and the loan value went down to nothing. We seemed to\nhave an insolvable economic problem\u2014a microeconomic problem.\n\nNow, we could have gone to McKinsey, or maybe to a bunch of professors from Harvard, and we would have gotten a report\nabout 10 inches thick about the ways we could approach this failing hotel in this terrible neighborhood. But instead, we put a sign\non the property that said, \u201cFor sale or rent.\u201d And in came, in response to that sign, aman who said, \u201cI'll spend $200,000 fixing up\nyour hotel and buy it at a high price on credit if you can get zoning so I can turn the parking lot into a putting green.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou've got to have a parking lot in a hotel,\u201d we said. \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cNo, my business is flying seniors in from Florida, putting them near the airport, and then letting them go out to\nDisneyland and various places by bus and coming back. I don\u2019t care how bad the neighborhood is going to be because my people are\nself-contained behind walls. All they have to do is get on the bus in the morning and come home in the evening. They don\u2019t need a\nparking lot; they need a putting green.\u201d\n\nSo we made the deal with the guy. The whole thing worked beautifully, and the loan got paid off, and it all worked out.\n\f"}, "003998.png": {"text": "Obviously, that\u2019s an interaction of Ricardo and the pin factory examples. The odd system that this guy had designed to amuse\nseniors was pure pin factory, and finding the guy with this system was pure Ricardo. So these things are interacting.\n\nWell, I\u2019ve taken you partway through the synthesis. It gets harder when you want to figure out how much activity should be\nwithin private firms, and how much should be within the government, and what are the factors that determine which functions\nare where, and why do the failures occur, and so on and so on.\n\nIt\u2019s my opinion that anybody with a high IQ who graduated in economics ought to be able to sit down and write a 10-page\nsynthesis of all these ideas that\u2019s quite persuasive. And I would bet a lot of money that I could give this test in practically every eco-\nnomics department in the country and get a perfectly lousy bunch of synthesis. They\u2019d give me Ronald Coase. They\u2019d talk about\ntransaction costs. They\u2019d click off a little something that their professors gave them and spit it back. But in terms of really under-\nstanding how it all fits together, I would confidently predict that most people couldn\u2019t do it very well.\n\nBy the way, if any of you want to try and do this, go ahead. I think you'll find it hard. In this connection, one of the interesting\nthings that I want to mention is that Max Planck, the great Nobel laureate who found Planck's constant, tried once to do economics.\nHe gave it up.\n\nNow, why did Max Planck, one of the smartest people who ever lived, give up economics? The answer is, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s too hard.\nThe best solution you can get is messy and uncertain.\u201d It didn\u2019t satisfy Planck\u2019s craving for order, and so he gave it up. And if Max\nPlanck early on realized he was never going to get perfect order, I will confidently predict that all of the rest of you are going to have\nexactly the same result.\n\nBy the way, there\u2019s a famous story about Max Planck that is apocryphal: After he won his prize, he was invited to lecture\neverywhere, and he had this chauffeur who drove him around to give public lectures all through Germany. And the chauffeur\nmemorized the lecture, so one day he said, \u201cGee, Professor Planck, why don\u2019t you let me try it by switching places?\u201d So he got up\nand gave the lecture. At the end of it, some physicist stood up and posed a question of extreme difficulty. But the chauffeur was up\nto it. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m surprised that a citizen of an advanced city like Munich is asking so elementary a question, so I\u2019m going to\n\nask my chauffeur to respond.\u201d\n\f"}, "003999.png": {"text": "SIX\n\nExtreme and counterproductive psychological ignorance\n\nAllright, I\u2019m down to the sixth main defect, and this is a subdivision of the lack of adequate multidisciplinarity: extreme and\ncounterproductive psychological ignorance in economics.

Identical in appearance, they\u2019re identical in the function.\nThey have exactly the same payout ratios. The things that cause the payouts are exactly the same.

If you know the psychological factors, if you've got them on a checklist in your head, you just\n\nrun down the factors, and boom! You get to one that must explain this occurrence.

In this little sub-\ndivision of Latin America, a culture had arisen wherein everybody stole everything. They embezzled from the company; they stole\neverything that was loose in the community. And, of course, the economy came practically to a halt. And this thing got fixed.\n\nNow, where did I read about this case? I\u2019'll give you a hint. It wasn\u2019t in the annals of economics. I found this case in the annals of\npsychology. Clever people went down and used a bunch of psychological tricks. And they fixed it.\n\nWell, I think there\u2019s no excuse if you're an economist, when there are wonderful cases like that of the dysfunctional economy\nbecoming fixed, and these simple tricks that solve so many problems, and you don\u2019t know how to do the fixes and understand the\nproblems. Why be so ignorant about psychology that you don\u2019t even know psychology\u2019s tricks that will fix your own dysfunctional\neconomic systems?\n\nHere, I want to give you an extreme injunction. This is even tougher than the fundamental organizing ethos of hard science.\nThis has been attributed to Samuel Johnson. He said, in substance, that if an academic maintains in place an ignorance that can be\neasily removed with a little work, the conduct of the academic amounts to treachery. That was his word, \u201ctreachery.\u201d You can see\nwhy I love this stuff. He says you have a duty if you're an academic to be as little of a klutz as you can possibly be, and therefore you\n\nhave got to keep grinding out of your system as much removable ignorance as you can remove.\n\nSEVEN\n\nToo little attention to second- and higher-order effects\n\f"}, "004001.png": {"text": "On to the next one, the seventh defect: too little attention in economics to second-order and even higher-order effects. This defect\nis quite understandable because the consequences have consequences, and the consequences of the consequences have conse-\nquences, and so on. It gets very complicated. When I was a meteorologist, I found this stuff very irritating, and economics makes\nmeteorology look like a tea party.\n\nExtreme economic ignorance was displayed when various experts, including PhD economists, forecast the cost of the original\nMedicare law. They did simple extrapolations of past costs. Well, the cost forecast was off by a factor of more than 1,000 percent.\nThe cost they projected was less than 10 percent of the cost that happened. Once they put in place various new incentives, the\nbehavior changed in response to the incentives, and the numbers became quite different from their projection. And medicine in-\nvented new and expensive remedies, as it was sure to do.\n\nHow could a great group of experts make such a silly forecast? Answer: They oversimplified to get easy figures, like the rube\nrounding pi to 3.2. They chose not to consider effects of effects of effects, and so on.\n\nOne good thing about this common form of misthinking from the viewpoint of academia is that businesspeople are even more\nfoolish about microeconomics. The business version of the Medicare-type insanity is when you own a textile plant and a guy\ncomes in and says, \u201cOh, isn\u2019t this wonderful? They invented a new loom. It\u2019ll pay for itself in three years at current prices because\nit adds so much efficiency to the production of textiles.\u201d And you keep buying these looms, and their equivalent, for 20 years, and\nyou keep making 4 percent on capital; you never go anywhere. And the answer is, it wasn\u2019t that the technology didn\u2019t work, it\u2019s\nthat the laws of economics caused the benefit from the new looms to go to the people that bought the textiles, not to the guy who\nowned the textile plant.\n\nHow could anybody not know that if he\u2019d taken freshman economics or been through business school? I think the schools are\ndoing a lousy job. Otherwise, such insanities wouldn't happen so often.\n\nUsually, I don\u2019t use formal projections.

So this happens everywhere, and when econom-\nics is full of it, it is just like the rest of life.\n\nThere was a wonderful example of gaming a human system in the career of Victor Niederhoffer in the economics department\nof Harvard. Victor Niederhoffer was the son of a police lieutenant, and he needed to get As at Harvard. But he didn\u2019t want to do any\nserious work at Harvard because what he really liked doing was 1) playing world-class checkers; 2) gambling in high-stakes card\ngames, at which he was very good, all hours of the day and night; 3) being the squash champion of the United States, which he was\n\nfor years; and 4) being about as good a tennis player as a part-time tennis player could be.\n\f"}, "004003.png": {"text": "This did not leave much time for getting As at Harvard, so he went into the economics department. You'd think he would have\nchosen French poetry. But remember, this was a guy who could play championship checkers. He thought he was up to outsmarting\nthe Harvard economics department. And he was.\n\nHe noticed that the graduate students did most of the boring work that would otherwise go to the professors, and he noticed\nthat because it was so hard to get to be a graduate student at Harvard, they were all very brilliant and organized and hardworking,\nas well as much needed by grateful professors. And therefore, by custom, and as would be predicted from the psychological force\ncalled reciprocity tendency, in a really advanced graduate course, the professors always gave an A. So Victor Niederhoffer signed\nup for nothing but the most advanced graduate courses in the Harvard economics department, and of course he got A after A after\nAafter A, and was hardly ever near a class. And for a while, some people at Harvard may have thought it had a new prodigy on its\nhands.\n\nThat\u2019s a ridiculous story, but the scheme will work still. And Niederhoffer is famous: They call his style \u201cNiederhoffering the\ncurriculum.\u201d\n\nThis shows how all human systems are gamed. Another example of not thinking through the consequences of the conse-\nquences is the standard reaction in economics to Ricardo\u2019s law of comparative advantage giving benefit on both sides of trade.\n\nRicardo came up with a wonderful, nonobvious explanation that was so powerful that people were charmed with it, and they\nstill are because it\u2019s a very useful idea. Everybody in economics understands that comparative advantage is a big deal when one\nconsiders first-order advantages in trade from the Ricardo effect. But suppose you've got a very talented ethnic group, like the\nChinese, and they\u2019re very poor, and you\u2019re an advanced nation, and you create free trade with China, and it goes on for a long time.\nNow let\u2019s follow second- and third-order consequences. You are more prosperous than you would have been if you hadn't traded\nwith China in terms of average wellbeing in the United States, right? Ricardo proved it. But which nation is going to be growing\nfaster in economic terms? It\u2019s obviously China. They\u2019re absorbing all the modern technology of the world through this great facili-\ntator in free trade, and, like the Asian Tigers have proved, they will get ahead fast. Look at Hong Kong. Look at Taiwan. Look at early\n\nJapan.\n\f"}, "004004.png": {"text": "So you start in a place where you've got a weak nation of a billion and a quarter people, and in the end, they\u2019re going to bea\nmuch bigger, stronger nation than you are, maybe even having more and better atomic bombs. Well, Ricardo did not prove that\nthat\u2019s a wonderful outcome for the former leading nation. He didn\u2019t try to determine second-order and higher-order effects.\n\nIf you try to talk like this to economics professors\u2014and I\u2019ve done this three times\u2014they shrink in horror and offense because\nthey don\u2019t like this kind of talk. It really gums up this nice discipline of theirs, which is so much simpler when you ignore second-\nand third-order consequences.\n\nThe best answer I ever got on that subject\u2014in three tries\u2014was from George Shultz. He said, \u201cCharlie, the way I figure it is if we\nstop trading with China, the other advanced nations will do it anyway. We wouldn't stop the ascent of China compared to us, and\nwe'd lose the Ricardo-diagnosed advantages of trade.\u201d Which is obviously correct.\n\nI said, \u201cWell, George, you've just invented a new form of the tragedy of the commons. You're locked in this system, and you can\u2019t\nfix it. You\u2019re going to go to a tragic hell in a handbasket, if going to hell involves being once the great leader of the world and finally\ngoing to the shallows in terms of leadership.\u201d\n\nAnd he said, \u201cCharlie, I do not want to think about this.\u201d\n\nI think he\u2019s wise. He\u2019s even older than I am, and maybe I should learn from him.\n\nEIGHT\n\nNot enough attention to the concept of febezzlement\n\nOkay, I\u2019m now down to my eighth objection: too little attention within economics to the simplest and most fundamental principle\n\nof algebra.\n\f"}, "004005.png": {"text": "Now, this sounds outrageous, that economics doesn\u2019t do algebra, right? Well, I want to try an example\u2014I may be wrong on this.\nY\u2019mold and I\u2019m iconoclastic. But I throw it out anyway. I say that economics doesn\u2019t pay enough attention to the concept of febez-\nzlement. And that I derive from Galbraith\u2019s idea.\n\nGalbraith\u2019s idea was that if you have an undisclosed embezzlement, it has a wonderful Keynesian stimulating effect on the\neconomy because the guy who's been embezzled thinks he is as rich as he always was and spends accordingly, and the guy who has\nstolen the money gets all this new purchasing power. I think that\u2019s correct analysis on Galbraith\u2019s part. The trouble with his notion\nis that he\u2019s described a minor phenomenon. Because when the embezzlement is discovered, as it almost surely will be, the effect\nwill quickly reverse. So the effect quickly cancels out.\n\nBut suppose you paid a lot of attention to algebra, which I guess Galbraith didn\u2019t, and you think, \u201cWell, the fundamental prin-\nciple of algebra is \u2018If A is equal to B and B is equal to C, then A is equal to C.\u201d\u201d You've then got a fundamental principle that demands\nthat you look for functional equivalents, all you can find.\n\nSo suppose you ask the question \u201cIs there such a thing in economics as a febezzlement?\u201d By the way, Galbraith invented the\nword \u201cbezzle\u201d to describe the amount of undisclosed embezzlement, so I invented the word \u201cfebezzlement,\u201d the functional equiv-\nalent of embezzlement. This happened after I asked the question \u201cIs there a functional equivalent of embezzlement?\u201d I came up\nwith a lot of wonderful, affirmative answers. Some were in investment management. After all, I\u2019m near investment management.\nI considered the billions of dollars totally wasted in the course of investing common stock portfolios for American owners. As\nlong as the market keeps going up, the guy who\u2019s wasting all this money doesn\u2019t feel it because he\u2019s looking at these steadily rising\nvalues. And to the guy who is getting the money for investment advice, the money looks like well-earned income when he\u2019s really\nselling detriment for money\u2014surely the functional equivalent of undisclosed embezzlement. You can see why I don\u2019t get invited to\nmany lectures.\n\nSo I say, if you look in the economy for febezzlement, the functional equivalent of embezzlement, you'll find some enormously\n\npowerful factors. They create some wealth effect that is on steroids compared to the old wealth effect. But practically nobody\n\f"}, "004006.png": {"text": "thinks as I do, and I quitclaim my idea to any hungry graduate student who has independent means, which he will need before his\n\nthesis topic is approved.\n\nNINE\n\nNot enough attention to virtue and vice effects\n\nOkay, my ninth objection: not enough attention to virtue and vice effects in economics.\n\nIt has been plain to me since early life that there are enormous virtue effects in economics and also enormous vice effects. But\neconomists get very uncomfortable when you talk about virtue and vice. It doesn\u2019t lend itself to a lot of columns of numbers. But\nI would argue that there are big virtue effects in economics. I would say that the spreading of double-entry bookkeeping by the\nmonk Fra Luca de Pacioli~ was a big virtue effect in economics. It made business more controllable, and it made it more honest.\n\nThen the cash register. The cash register did more for human morality than the congregational church. It was a really powerful\nphenomenon to make an economic system work better, just as in reverse, a system that can be easily defrauded ruins a civilization.\nAsystem that\u2019s very hard to defraud, like a cash register-based system, helps the economic performance of a civilization by reduc-\ning vice, but very few people within economics talk about it in those terms.\n\nTl go further: I say economic systems work better when there\u2019s an extreme reliability ethos. The traditional way to get a relia-\nbility ethos, at least in past generations in America, was through religion. The religions instilled guilt. We have a charming Irish\nCatholic priest in our neighborhood, and he loves to say, \u201cThose old Jews may have invented guilt, but we perfected it.\u201d This guilt,\nderived from religion, has been a huge driver of a reliability ethos, which has been very helpful to economic outcomes for man.\n\nMany bad effects from vice are clear. You've got the crazy booms and crooked promotions\u2014all you have to do is read the paper\nover the last six months. There\u2019s enough vice to make us all choke. And by the way, everybody\u2019s angry about unfair compensation\n\nat the top of American corporations, and people should be. We now face various crazy governance nostrums invented by lawyers\n\f"}, "004007.png": {"text": "and professors that won't give us a fix for unfair compensation, yet a good partial solution is obvious: If directors were significant\nshareholders who got a pay of zero, you\u2019d be amazed what would happen to unfair compensation of corporate executives as we\ndampened effects from reciprocity tendency.\n\nAroughly similar equivalent of this no-pay system has been tried in a strange place. In England, lay magistrates staff the lower\ncriminal courts, which can send you to prison for a year or fine you substantially. You've got three judges sitting up there, and they\nall get a pay of zero. Their expenses are reimbursed, but not too liberally. And they work about 40 half-days a year as volunteers. It\u2019s\nworked beautifully for about 700 years. Able and honest people compete to become magistrates, to perform the duty and get the\nsignificance but no pay.\n\nThis is the system Benjamin Franklin, near the end of his life, wanted for the US government. He didn\u2019t want the high execu-\ntives of government to be paid but to be like himself or the entirely unpaid, well-off ministers and rulers of the Mormon Church.\nAnd when I see what\u2019s happened in California, I\u2019m not sure he wasn\u2019t right. At any rate, no one now drifts in Franklin\u2019s direction.\nFor one thing, professors\u2014and most of them need money\u2014get appointed directors.\n\nItis not always recognized that to function best, morality should sometimes appear unfair, like most worldly outcomes. The\ncraving for perfect fairness causes a lot of terrible problems in system function. Some systems should be made deliberately unfair\nto individuals because they'll be fairer on average for all of us. Thus, there can be virtue in apparent non-fairness.\n\nI frequently cite the example of having your career over in the Navy if your ship goes aground, even if it wasn\u2019t your fault. I say\nthe lack of justice for the one guy who wasn\u2019t at fault is way more than made up by a greater justice for everybody when every cap-\ntain of a ship always sweats blood to make sure the ship doesn\u2019t go aground. Tolerating a little unfairness to some to get a greater\nfairness for all is a model I recommend to all of you. But again, I wouldn\u2019t put it in your assigned college work if you want to be\ngraded well, particularly in a modern law school wherein there is usually an overlove of fairness-seeking process.\n\nThere are, of course, enormous vice effects in economics. You have these bubbles with so much fraud and folly. The aftermath\nis frequently very unpleasant, and we've had some of that lately. One of the first big bubbles, of course, was the huge and horrible\n\nSouth Sea Bubble~ in England. The aftermath was interesting.\n\f"}, "004008.png": {"text": "Many of you probably don\u2019t remember what happened after the South Sea Bubble, which caused an enormous financial con-\ntraction and a lot of pain. Except in certain rare cases, they banned publicly traded stock in England for decades. Parliament passed\na law that said you can have a partnership with a few partners but you can\u2019t have publicly traded stock. And by the way, England\ncontinued to grow without publicly traded stock. The people who are in the business of prospering because there\u2019s a lot of stock\nbeing traded in casino-like frenzy wouldn't like this example if they studied it enough.\n\nIt didn\u2019t ruin England to have a long period when they didn\u2019t have publicly traded shares. Just as in real estate\u2014we had all the\nshopping centers and auto dealerships and so on we needed for years when we didn\u2019t have publicly traded real estate shares. It\u2019s a\nmyth that once you've got some capital market, economic considerations demand that it has to be as fast and efficient as a casino.\nIt doesn't.\n\nAnother interesting problem is raised by vice effects involving envy. Envy wisely got a very strong condemnation in the laws\nof Moses. You remember how they laid it on with a trowel: You couldn\u2019t covet thy neighbor\u2019s ass, you couldn\u2019t covet thy neighbor\u2019s\nservant girl, you couldn\u2019t covet ... Those old Jews knew how envious people are and how much trouble it caused. They really laid it\non hard, and they were right.\n\nBut [Bernard de] Mandeville\u2014remember his fable of \u2018bees? He demonstrated convincingly, to me, anyway, that envy was a\ngreat driver of proclivity to spend. And so, here\u2019s this terrible vice, which is forbidden in the Ten Commandments, and here it\u2019s\ndriving all these favorable results in economics. There\u2019s some paradox in economics that nobody\u2019s going to get out.\n\nWhen I was young, everybody was excited by [Kurt] Godel, ~ who came up with proof that you couldn't have a mathematical\nsystem without a lot of irritating incompleteness in it. Well, since then, my betters tell me that they\u2019ve come up with more irre-\nmovable defects in mathematics and have decided that you're never going to get mathematics without some paradox in it. No mat-\nter how hard you work, you're going to have to live with some paradox if you're a mathematician.\n\nWell, if the mathematicians can\u2019t get the paradox out of their system when they\u2019re creating it themselves, the poor economists\n\nare never going to get rid of paradoxes, nor are any of the rest of us. It doesn\u2019t matter. Life is interesting with some paradox. When\n\f"}, "004009.png": {"text": "Irun into a paradox, I think either I\u2019m a total horse\u2019s ass to have gotten to this point or I\u2019m fruitfully near the edge of my discipline.\nIt adds excitement to life to wonder which it is.\n\nAs I conclude, I want to tell one more story demonstrating how awful it is to get a wrong idea from a limited repertoire and just\nstick to it. This is the story of Hyman Liebowitz, who came to America from the old country. In the new country, as in the old, he\ntried to make his way in the family trade, which was manufacturing nails. And he struggled, and he struggled, and finally his little\nnail business got to vast prosperity, and his wife said to him, \u201cYou are old, Hyman. It\u2019s time to go to Florida and turn the business\nover to our son.\u201d\n\nSo down he went to Florida, turning his business over to the son, but he got weekly financial reports. And he hadn't been in\nFlorida very long before they turned sharply negative. In fact, they were terrible. So he got on an airplane, and he went back to\nNew Jersey where the factory was. As he left the airport on the way to the factory, he saw this enormous outdoor advertising sign\nlighted up. There was Jesus, spread out on the cross. And under it was a big legend: \u201cThey Used Liebowitz\u2019s Nails.\u201d\n\nSo he stormed into the factory and said, \u201cYou dumb son! What do you think you're doing? It took me 50 years to create this busi-\nness!\u201d \u201cPapa,\u201d the son said, \u201ctrust me. I will fix it.\u201d\n\nSo back he went to Florida, and while he was in Florida, he got more reports, and the results kept getting worse. So he got on the\nairplane again. Left the airport, drove by the sign, looked up at this big lighted sign, and now there's a vacant cross. And lo and be-\nhold, Jesus is crumpled on the ground under the cross, and the sign said, \u201cThey Didn't Use Liebowitz\u2019s Nails.\u201d\n\nWell, you can laugh at that. It is ridiculous, but it\u2019s no more ridiculous than the way a lot of people cling to failed ideas.\n\nKeynes said, \u201cIt\u2019s not bringing in the new ideas that\u2019s so hard. It\u2019s getting rid of the old ones.\u201d And Einstein said it better, at-\ntributing his mental success to \u201ccuriosity, concentration, perseverance, and self-criticism.\u201d By self-criticism, he meant becoming\ngood at destroying your own best-loved and hardest-won ideas. If you can get really good at destroying your own wrong ideas, that\nis a great gift.\n\nWell, it\u2019s time to repeat the big lesson in this little talk. What I\u2019ve urged is the use of a bigger multidisciplinary bag of tricks,\n\nmastered to fluency, to help economics and everything else. And I also urged that people not be discouraged by irremovable com-\n\f"}, "004010.png": {"text": "plexity and paradox. It just adds more fun to the problems. My inspiration again is Keynes: Better roughly right than precisely\nwrong.\n\nAnd so, I end by repeating what I said once before on a similar occasion. If you skillfully follow the multidisciplinary path, you\nwill never wish to come back. It would be like cutting off your hands.\n\nWell, that\u2019s the end. I\u2019ll take questions as long as people can endure me.\n\nAudience question: [The question was garbled, but the person asked about derivatives, which Buffett has called \u201cfinancial\nweapons of mass destruction.\u201d] Buffett said that the genie\u2019s out of the bottle and the hangover may be proportionate to the\n\nbinge. Would you speculate for us how that scenario can play out?\n\n\u2018Well, of course, catastrophe predictions have always been quite difficult to make with success. But I confidently predict that there\nare big troubles to come. The system is almost insanely irresponsible. And what people think are fixes aren't really fixes. It\u2019s so\ncomplicated I can\u2019t do it justice here, but you can\u2019t believe the trillions of dollars involved. You can\u2019t believe the complexity. You\ncan\u2019t believe how difficult it is to do the accounting. You can\u2019t believe how big the incentives are to have wishful thinking about\nvalues and wishful thinking about ability to clear.\n\nRunning off a derivative book is agony and takes time. You saw what happened when they tried to run off the derivative books\nat Enron. Its certified net worth vanished. In the derivative books of America, there are a lot of reported profits that were never\nearned and assets that never existed.\n\nThere are large febezzlement effects and some ordinary embezzlement effects that come from derivative activity. And the\nreversal of these is going to cause pain. How big the pain will be and how well it will be handled, I can\u2019t tell you.

But I hope it provided more than harmless\nfun. I even hope that some shred of my ideas eventually gets into academic economics, not because I want recognition but because\nI think academic economics needs some improvement.\n\nSince the talk was given, I came across a book published by Alfred A. Knopf in 2005. It was written by a distinguished Harvard\neconomics professor, Benjamin M. Friedman, and dealt with the interplay of economics and morals, much as I wished to in my\ntalk. The title of this book is The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth.\n\nAs readers will note from the title, Professor Friedman is particularly interested in the impact of economic growth on morals,\nwhereas my interest is mostly in the reverse direction, the impact of morals on economic growth.

Well, the answer is obvious: He hasn't died yet. And why was this\nspeaker chosen? Well, I don\u2019t know that. I'd like to think that the development department had nothing to do with it.\n\nWhatever the reason, I think it\u2019s fitting that I\u2019m speaking here because I see a crowd of older people in the rear, not wearing\nrobes. And I know, from having educated an army of descendants, who it is that really deserves a lot of the honors that are being\ngiven today to the robe-wearing students in front. The sacrifices and the wisdom and the value transfer that come from one gener-\nation to the next should always be appreciated.\n\nalso take pleasure from the sea of Asian faces to my left. All my life I have admired Confucius. I like the idea of filial piety,\u201d\nof ideas or values that are taught and duties that come naturally that should be passed onto the next generation. You people who\ndon\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in this idea, please note how fast Asian people are rising in American life. I think they have something.\n\nAllright, I\u2019ve scratched out a few notes, and I\u2019m going to try and give an account of certain ideas and attitudes that have worked\nwell for me. I don\u2019t claim that they\u2019re perfect for everybody. But I think many of them contain universal values and that many of\nthem are can\u2019t-fail ideas.\n\nWhat are the core ideas that helped me? Well, luckily I had the idea at a very early age that the safest way to try to get what\nyou want is to try to deserve what you want. It\u2019s such a simple idea. It\u2019s the golden rule. You want to deliver to the world what you\n\nwould buy if you were on the other end. There is no ethos in my opinion that is better for any lawyer or any other person to have.\n\f"}, "004015.png": {"text": "By and large, the people who have had this ethos win in life, and they don\u2019t win just money and honors. They win the respect, the\ndeserved trust of the people they deal with. And there is huge pleasure in life to be obtained from getting deserved trust.\n\nNow, occasionally you will find a perfect rogue of a person who dies rich and widely known. But mostly these people are fully\nunderstood as despicable by the surrounding civilization. If the cathedral is full of people at the funeral ceremony, most of them\nare there to celebrate the fact that the person is dead.\n\nThat reminds me of the story of the time when one of these people died, and the minister said, \u201cIt\u2019s now time to say something\nnice about the deceased.\u201d And nobody came forward, and nobody came forward, and nobody came forward. And finally, one man\ncame up and said, \u201cWell, his brother was worse.\u201d That is not where you want to go. A life ending in such a funeral is not the life you\nwant to have.\n\nThe second idea that I developed very early is that there's no love that\u2019s so right as admiration-based love, and such love should\ninclude the instructive dead. Somehow I picked up that idea, and I\u2019ve lived with it all my life. It\u2019s been very useful to me. A love like\nthat described by [William] Somerset Maugham in his book Of Human Bondage is a sick kind of love. It\u2019s a disease, and if you find\nyourself with a disease like that, you should eliminate it.\n\nAnother idea\u2014and this may remind you of Confucius, too\u2014is that the acquisition of wisdom is a moral duty. It\u2019s not something\nyou do just to advance in life. And there\u2019s a corollary to that idea that is very important. It requires that you're hooked on lifetime\nlearning. Without lifetime learning, you people are not going to do very well. You are not going to get very far in life based on what\nyou already know. You're going to advance in life by what you learn after you leave here.\n\nConsider Berkshire Hathaway, one of the best-regarded corporations in the world. It may have the best long-term, big-assets-\ninvolving investment record in the history of civilization. The skill that got Berkshire through one decade would not have sufficed\nto get it through the next decade with comparable levels of achievement. Warren Buffett had to be a continuous learning machine.\n\nThe same requirement exists in lower walks of life. I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not\neven the most diligent. But they are learning machines. They go to bed every night a little wiser than they were that morning. And\n\nboy, does that habit help, particularly when you have a long run ahead of you.\n\f"}, "004016.png": {"text": "Alfred North Whitehead correctly said at one time that the rapid advance of civilization came only when man \u201cinvented the\nmethod of invention.\u201d He was referring to the huge growth in GDP per capita and many other good things we now take for granted.\nBig-time progress started a few hundred years ago. Before that, progress per century was almost nil. Just as civilization can\nprogress only when it invents the method of invention, you can progress only when you learn the method of learning.\n\nI was very lucky. I came to law school having learned the method of learning, and nothing has served me better in my long life\nthan continuous learning. Consider Warren Buffett again. If you watched him with a time clock, you'd find that about half of his\nwaking time is spent reading. Then a big chunk of the rest of his time is spent talking one-on-one, either on the telephone or per-\nsonally, with highly gifted people whom he trusts and who trust him. Viewed up close, Warren looks quite academic as he achieves\nworldly success.\n\nAcademia has many wonderful values in it. I came across an example not too long ago. In my capacity as a hospital board\nchairman, I was dealing with a medical school academic named Joseph M. Mirra, MD. This man, over years of disciplined work,\nmade himself know more about bone tumor pathology than almost anyone else in the world. He wanted to pass this knowledge on\nto help treat bone cancer. How was he going to do it? Well, he decided to write a textbook, and even though I don\u2019t think a textbook\nlike this sells more than a few thousand copies, they do end up in cancer treatment centers all over the world. He took a sabbatical\nyear and sat down at his computer with all his slides, carefully saved and organized. He worked 17 hours a day, seven days a week,\nfor a year. Some sabbatical. At the end of the year, he had created one of the two great bone tumor pathology textbooks of the\nworld. When you're around values like Mirra\u2019s, you want to pick up as much as you can.\n\nAnother idea that was hugely useful to me was one I obtained when I listened in law school when some waggish professor said,\n\u201cA legal mind is a mind that considers it feasible and useful, when two things are all twisted up together and interacting, to try to\nthink about one thing without considering the other.\u201d\n\nWell, I could see from that indirectly pejorative sentence that any such legal approach was ridiculous. And this pushed me\nfurther along in my natural drift, which was toward learning all the big ideas in all the big disciplines, so I wouldn't be the perfect\n\ndamn fool the professor described. And because the really big ideas carry about 95 percent of the freight, it wasn\u2019t at all hard for me\n\f"}, "004017.png": {"text": "to pick up about 95 percent of what I needed from all the disciplines and to include use of this knowledge as a standard part of my\nmental routines.\n\nOnce you have the ideas, of course, you must continuously practice their use. Like a concert pianist, if you don\u2019t practice you\ncan\u2019t perform well. So I went through life constantly practicing a multidisciplinary approach.\n\nWell, this habit has done a lot for me. It\u2019s made life more fun. It\u2019s made me more constructive. It\u2019s made me more helpful to oth-\ners. It\u2019s made me richer than can be explained by any genetic gifts. My mental routine, properly practiced, really helps.\n\nNow, there are dangers in it because it works so well. If you use it, you will frequently find when you're with some expert from\nanother discipline\u2014maybe even an expert who is your employer, with a vast ability to harm you\u2014that you know more than he\ndoes about fitting his specialty to the problem at hand. You'll sometimes see the correct answer when he\u2019s missed it. That is a very\ndangerous position to be in. You can cause enormous offense by being right in a way that causes somebody else to lose face in his\nown discipline or hierarchy. I never found the perfect way to avoid harm from this serious problem. Even though I was a good\npoker player when I was young, I wasn\u2019t good enough at pretending when I thought I knew more than my supervisors did. And I\ndidn\u2019t try as hard at pretending as would have been prudent. So I gave a lot of offense. Now, I\u2019m generally tolerated as a harmless\neccentric who will soon be gone. But coming up, I had a difficult period to go through.\n\nMy advice to you is to be better than I was at keeping insights hidden. One of my colleagues, who graduated as number one in\nhis class in law school and clerked at the US Supreme Court, tended as a young lawyer to show that he knew a lot. One day, the\nsenior partner he was working under called him in and said, \u201cListen, Chuck, I want to explain something to you. Your duty is to\nbehave in such a way that the client thinks he\u2019s the smartest person in the room. If you have any energy or insight available after\nthat, use it to make your senior partner look like the second-smartest person in the room. And only after you've satisfied those two\nobligations do you want your light to shine at all.\u201d\n\nWell, that was a good system for rising in many a large law firm. But it wasn\u2019t what I did. I usually moved with the drift of my\n\nnature, and if some other people didn\u2019t like it, well, I didn\u2019t need to be adored by everybody.\n\f"}, "004018.png": {"text": "Let me further develop the idea that a multidisciplinary attitude is required if maturity is to be effective. Here I\u2019m following a\nkey idea of the greatest lawyer of antiquity, Marcus Tullius Cicero. Cicero is famous for saying that a man who doesn\u2019t know what\nhappened before he\u2019s born goes through life like a child. That is a very correct idea. Cicero is right to ridicule somebody so foolish as\nnot to know history. But if you generalize Cicero, as I think one should, there are a lot of other things that one should know in addi-\ntion to history. And those other things are the big ideas in all the disciplines.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t help you much just to know something well enough so that on one occasion you can prattle your way to an Ain\nan exam. You have to learn many things in such a way that they\u2019re in a mental latticework in your head and you automatically use\nthem the rest of your life. If many of you try that, I solemnly promise that one day most will correctly come to think, \u201cSomehow\nI\u2019ve become one of the most effective people in my whole age cohort.\u201d In contrast, if no effort is made toward such multidisci-\nplinarity, many of the brightest of you who choose this course will live in the middle ranks, or in the shallows.\n\nAnother idea that I discovered was encapsulated by that story Dean McCaffery recounted earlier about the rustic who wanted to\nknow where he was going to die so he wouldn't go there. The rustic who had that ridiculous-sounding idea had a profound truth in\nhis possession. The way complex adaptive systems work, and the way mental constructs work, problems frequently become easier\nto solve through inversion. If you turn problems around into reverse, you often think better. For instance, if you want to help India,\nthe question you should consider asking is not \u201cHow can I help India?\u201d Instead, you should ask, \u201cHow can I hurt India?\u201d You find\nwhat will do the worst damage and then try to avoid it.\n\nPerhaps the two approaches seem logically the same thing. But those who have mastered algebra know that inversion will\noften and easily solve problems that otherwise resist solution. And in life, just as in algebra, inversion will help you solve problems\nthat you can\u2019t otherwise handle.\n\nLet me use a little inversion now. What will really fail in life? What do we want to avoid? Some answers are easy. For example,\nsloth and unreliability will fail. If you\u2019re unreliable, it doesn\u2019t matter what your virtues are, you're going to crater immediately. So\nfaithfully doing what you've engaged to do should be an automatic part of your conduct. Of course you want to avoid sloth and\n\nunreliability.\n\f"}, "004019.png": {"text": "Another thing to avoid is extremely intense ideology, because it cabbages up one\u2019s mind. You see a lot of it in the worst of the\nTV preachers. They have different, intense, inconsistent ideas about technical theology, and a lot of them have minds reduced to\ncabbage. That can happen with political ideology. And if you're young, it\u2019s particularly easy to drift into intense and foolish politi-\ncal ideology and never get out.\n\nWhen you announce that you're a loyal member of some cult-like group and you start shouting out the orthodox ideology, what\nyou're doing is pounding it in, pounding it in, pounding it in. You're ruining your mind, sometimes with startling speed. So you\nwant to be very careful with intense ideology. It presents a big danger for the only mind you're ever going to have.\n\nDarwin formulated his theories on the transmutation of species in the late 1830s, but it was not until 1859 that he published\nhis seminal work, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. Darwin accepted that any scientific theory proffering an al-\nternative explanation to human origins would be met with widespread prejudice, and that therefore prudence dictated he become\nfully versed in every possible counterargument before publishing his ideas. Accordingly, he spent 20 years painstakingly cultivat-\ning his theory and preparing for its defense.\n\nThere is a warning example I use whenever I feel threatened by a drift toward intense political ideology. Some Scandinavian ca-\nnoeists succeeded in getting through all the rapids of Scandinavia, and they thought they would continue their success by tackling\nthe big whirlpools in northwest America. The death rate was 100 percent. A big whirlpool is something you want to avoid. AndI\nthink the same is true about intense ideology, particularly when your companions are all true believers.\n\nThave what I call an iron prescription that helps me keep sane when I drift toward preferring one intense ideology over another.\nI feel that I\u2019m not entitled to have an opinion unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people who are\nin opposition. I think that I am qualified to speak only when I\u2019ve reached that state.\n\nThis sounds almost as extreme as the iron prescription Dean Acheson was fond of attributing to William the Silent of Orange,\nwho roughly said, \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to hope in order to persevere.\u201d That probably is too tough for most people, although I hope it\n\nwon't ever become too tough for me. My way of avoiding overintensity in ideology is easier than Acheson\u2019s injunction and worth\n\f"}, "004020.png": {"text": "learning. This business of not drifting into extreme ideology is very, very important in life. If you want to end up wise, heavy ideol-\nogy is very likely to prevent that outcome.\n\nAnother thing that often causes folly and ruin is the self-serving bias, often subconscious, to which we're all subject. You think\nthat \u201cthe true little me\u201d is entitled to do what it wants to do. For instance, why shouldn\u2019t the true little me get what it wants by\noverspending its income?\n\nWell, there once was a man who became the most famous composer in the world, but he was utterly miserable most of the time.\nOne of the reasons was that he always overspent his income. That was Mozart.\u201d If Mozart couldn\u2019t get by with this kind of asinine\nconduct, I don\u2019t think you should try it.\n\nGenerally speaking, envy, resentment, revenge, and self-pity are disastrous modes of thought. Self-pity can get pretty close to\nparanoia. Paranoia is one of the very hardest things to reverse. You do not want to drift into self-pity. I had a friend who carried\na thick stack of linen-based cards. When somebody would make a comment that reflected self-pity, he would slowly and porten-\ntously pull out his huge stack of cards, take the top one, and hand it to the person. The card said, \u201cYour story has touched my heart.\nNever have I heard of anyone with as many misfortunes as you.\u201d\n\nWell, you can say that\u2019s waggery, but I suggest it can be mental hygiene. Every time you find you're drifting into self-pity, what-\never the cause, even if your child is dying of cancer, self-pity is not going to help. Just give yourself one of my friend\u2019s cards. Self-\npity is always counterproductive. It\u2019s the wrong way to think. And when you avoid it you get a great advantage over everybody else,\nor almost everybody else, because self-pity is a standard response. And you can train yourself out of it.\n\nOf course, you also want to get self-serving bias out of your mental routines. Thinking that what\u2019s good for you is good for the\nwider civilization and rationalizing foolish or evil conduct based on your subconscious tendency to serve yourself is a terrible way\nto think. You want to drive that out of yourself because you want to be wise, not foolish, and good, not evil.\n\nYou also have to allow, in your own cognition and conduct, for the self-serving bias of everybody else, because most people are\nnot going to be very successful at removing such bias, the human condition being what it is. If you don\u2019t allow for self-serving bias\n\nin the conduct of others, you are, again, a fool.\n\f"}, "004021.png": {"text": "I watched the brilliant and worthy Harvard Law Review-trained general counsel of Salomon Brothers lose his career there.\nWhen the able CEO was told that an underling had done something wrong, the general counsel said, \u201cGee, we don\u2019t have any legal\nduty to report this, but I think it\u2019s what we should do. It\u2019s our moral duty.\u201d\n\nThe general counsel was technically and morally correct, but his approach didn\u2019t persuade. He recommended a very unpleasant\nthing for the busy CEO to do and the CEO, quite understandably, put the issue off, and put it off, not with any intent to do wrong. In\ndue course, when powerful regulators resented not having been promptly informed, down went the CEO and the general counsel\nwith him.\n\nThe correct persuasive technique in situations like that was given by Ben Franklin. He said, \u201cIf you would persuade, appeal to\ninterest, not to reason.\u201d The self-serving bias of man is extreme, and should have been used in attaining the correct outcome. So\nthe general counsel should have said, \u201cLook, this is likely to erupt into something that will destroy you, take away your money,\ntake away your status, grossly impair your reputation. My recommendation will prevent a likely disaster from which you can\u2019t re-\ncover.\u201d That approach would have worked. You should often appeal to interest, not to reason, even when your motives are lofty.\n\nAnother thing to avoid is being subjected to perverse incentives. You don\u2019t want to be in a perverse incentive system that\u2019s\nrewarding you if you behave more and more foolishly, or worse and worse. Perverse incentives are so powerful as controllers of\nhuman cognition and human behavior that one should avoid their influence. One of the things you're going to find in at least a few\nmodern law firms is high billable-hour quotas. I could not have lived under billable-hour quotas of 2,400 hours a year. That would\nhave caused too many problems for me. I wouldn't have done it. I don\u2019t have a solution for the situation some of you will face. You'll\nhave to figure out for yourselves how to handle such significant problems.\n\nPerverse associations are also to be avoided. You particularly want to avoid working directly under somebody you don\u2019t admire\nand don\u2019t want to be like. It\u2019s dangerous. We're all subject to control to some extent by authority figures, particularly authority fig-\n\nures who are rewarding us. Dealing properly with this danger requires both some talent and will.\n\f"}, "004022.png": {"text": "Icoped in my time by identifying people I admired and by maneuvering, mostly without criticizing anybody, so that I was\nusually working under the right sort of people. A lot of law firms will permit that if you're shrewd enough to work it out with some\ntact. Generally, your outcome in life will be more satisfactory if you work under people you correctly admire.\n\nEngaging in routines that allow you to maintain objectivity are, of course, very helpful to cognition. We all remember that\nDarwin paid special attention to disconfirming evidence, particularly when it disconfirmed something he believed and loved. Rou-\ntines like that are required if a life is to maximize correct thinking.\n\nOne also needs checklist routines. They prevent a lot of errors, and not just for pilots. You should not only possess wide-ranging\nelementary wisdom but also go through mental checklist routines in using it. There is no other procedure that will work as well.\n\nAnother idea that I found important is that maximizing non-egality will often work wonders. What do I mean? Well, John\nWooden of UCLA presented an instructive example when he was the number one basketball coach in the world. He said to the\nbottom five players, \u201cYou don\u2019t get to play; you are practice partners.\u201d The top seven did almost all the playing. Well, the top\nseven learned more\u2014remember the importance of the learning machine\u2014because they were doing all the playing. And when he\nadopted that non-egalitarian system, Wooden won more games than he had won before.\n\nI think the game of competitive life often requires maximizing the experience of the people who have the most aptitude and\nthe most determination as learning machines. If you want the very highest reaches of human achievement, that\u2019s where you have\nto go. You do not want to choose a brain surgeon for your child by drawing straws to select one of 50 applicants, all of whom take\nturns doing procedures. You don\u2019t want your airplanes designed in too egalitarian a fashion. You don\u2019t want your Berkshire Hath-\naways run that way either. You want to provide a lot of playing time for your best players.\n\nI frequently tell the apocryphal story about how Max Planck, after he won the Nobel Prize, went around Germany giving the\nsame standard lecture on the new quantum mechanics. Over time, his chauffeur memorized the lecture and said, \u201cWould you\nmind, Professor Planck, because it\u2019s so boring to stay in our routine, if I gave the lecture in Munich and you just sat in front wearing\n\nmy chauffeur\u2019s hat?\u201d Planck said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d And the chauffeur got up and gave this long lecture on quantum mechanics, after\n\f"}, "004023.png": {"text": "which a physics professor stood up and asked a perfectly ghastly question. The speaker said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m surprised that in an ad-\nvanced city like Munich I get such an elementary question. I\u2019m going to ask my chauffeur to reply.\u201d\n\nWell, the reason I tell that story is not to celebrate the quick-wittedness of the protagonist. In this world, I think we have two\nkinds of knowledge. One is Planck knowledge, that of the people who really know. They\u2019ve paid the dues, they have the aptitude.\nThen we've got chauffeur knowledge. They have learned to prattle the talk. They may have a big head of hair. They often have a\nfine timbre in their voices. They make a big impression. But in the end, what they\u2019ve got is chauffeur knowledge masquerading as\nreal knowledge. I think I\u2019ve just described practically every politician in the United States. You're going to have the problem in your\nlife of getting as much responsibility as you can to the people with the Planck knowledge and away from the people who have the\nchauffeur knowledge.

More and more, we're delivering to you in California a legislature in which mostly\nthe certified nuts from the left and the certified nuts from the right are the ones allowed to serve. And none of them are removable.\nThat\u2019s what my generation has done for you. But you wouldn't like it to be too easy, would you?\n\nAnother thing that I have found is that intense interest in any subject is indispensable if you're really going to excel in it. Icould\nforce myself to be fairly good in a lot of things, but I couldn\u2019t excel in anything in which I didn\u2019t have an intense interest. So, to\nsome extent, you're going to have to do as I did. If at all feasible, you want to maneuver yourself into doing something in which you\nhave an intense interest.\n\nAnother thing you have to do is have a lot of assiduity. I like that word because to me it means \u201cSit down on your ass until you do\nit.\u201d I\u2019ve had marvelous partners, full of assiduity, all my life. I think I got them partly because I tried to deserve them and partly be-\ncause I was shrewd enough to select them, and partly there was some luck.\n\nTwo partners that I chose for one phase in my life made the following simple agreement when they created a little design-and-\nbuild construction team in the middle of the Great Depression: \u201cTwo-man partnership,\u201d they said, \u201cand divide everything equally.\n\nAnd whenever we're behind in our commitments to other people, we will both work 14 hours a day, seven days a week, until we\u2019re\n\f"}, "004024.png": {"text": "caught up.\u201d Well, needless to say that firm didn\u2019t fail, and my partners were widely admired. Simple, old-fashioned ideas like theirs\nare almost sure to provide a good outcome.\n\nAnother thing to cope with is that life is very likely to provide terrible blows, unfair blows. Some people recover and others\ndon\u2019t. There I think the attitude of Epictetus helps guide one to the right reaction. He thought that every mischance in life, how-\never bad, created an opportunity to behave well. He believed every mischance provided an opportunity to learn something useful,\nand one\u2019s duty was not to become immersed in self-pity but to utilize each terrible blow in a constructive fashion. His ideas were\nvery sound, influencing the best of the Roman emperors, Marcus Aurelius and many others over many centuries. And you may\nremember the epitaph that Epictetus made for himself: \u201cHere lies Epictetus, a slave, maimed in body, the ultimate in poverty, and\nfavored by the gods.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s the way Epictetus is now remembered: favored by the gods. He was favored because he became wise, became manly,\nand instructed others, both in his own time and over following centuries.\n\nI\u2019ve another idea to emphasize in a brief account. My grandfather Munger was the only federal judge in his city for nearly 40\nyears. I admired him. I\u2019m his namesake. And I\u2019m Confucian enough that even now, as I speak, I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWell, Judge Munger\nwould be pleased to have me here.\u201d All these years after my grandfather is dead, I conceive myself as duty-bound to carry the torch\nfor my grandfather\u2019s values. One such value was prudence as the servant of duty. Grandfather Munger was a federal judge at a time\nwhen there were no pensions for widows of federal judges. So if he didn\u2019t save from his income, my grandmother would become a\ndestitute widow. And besides, net worth would enable him to serve others better. Being the kind of man he was, he underspent his\nincome all his life and left his widow in comfortable circumstances.\n\nBut that was not all that his prudence enabled. Along the way, in the \u201930s, my uncle\u2019s tiny bank failed and couldn\u2019t reopen\nwithout help. My grandfather saved the bank by exchanging over a third of his good assets for horrible bank assets. I\u2019ve always re-\n\nmembered the event. It reminds me of [A. E.] Housman\u2019s little poem that went something like this:\n\nThe thoughts of others\n\f"}, "004025.png": {"text": "Were light and fleeting,\nOf lovers\u2019 meeting\n\nOr luck or fame.\n\nMine were of trouble,\nAnd mine were steady,\nAnd I was ready\n\nWhen trouble came.\n\nYou may well say, \u201cWho wants to go through life anticipating trouble?\u201d Well, I did, trained as I was. I\u2019ve gone through a long life\nanticipating trouble. And here I am now, well along in my 84th year. Like Epictetus, I\u2019ve had a favored life. It didn\u2019t make me un-\nhappy to anticipate trouble all the time and be ready to perform adequately if trouble came. It didn\u2019t hurt me at all. In fact, it helped\nme. So I quitclaim to you Housman and Judge Munger.\n\nThe last idea that I want to give to you, as you go out into a profession that frequently puts a lot of procedure and some mumbo-\njumbo into what it does, is that complex bureaucratic procedure does not represent the highest form civilization can reach. One\nhigher form is a seamless, non-bureaucratic web of deserved trust. Not much fancy procedure, just totally reliable people correctly\ntrusting one another. That\u2019s the way an operating room works at the Mayo Clinic. If lawyers would introduce a lot of lawyer-like\nprocess, more patients would die. So never forget, when you're a lawyer, that while you may have to sell procedure, you don\u2019t al-\nways have to buy. In your own life, what you want to maximize is a seamless web of deserved trust. And if your proposed marriage\ncontract has 47 pages, my suggestion is that you not enter.\n\nWell, that\u2019s enough for one graduation. I hope these ruminations of an old man are useful to you. In the end, I\u2019m speaking to-\n\nward the only outcome feasible for old Valiant-for-Truth in Pilgrim\u2019s Progress: \u201cMy sword I leave to him who can wield it.\u201d\n\f"}, "004026.png": {"text": "CHAPTER 4; TALK ELEVEN\n\nstripe.press/pca-15\n\nThe Psychology of Human Misjudgment\n\n2005\nSELECTIONS FROM THREE OF CHARLIE\u2019S TALKS, COMBINED INTO ONE TALK NEVER MADE, AFTER REVISIONS BY CHARLIE IN 2005 THAT\nINCLUDED CONSIDERABLE NEW MATERTAL\n\n \n\nIn the run-up to publishing this book, Charlie remarked that one of the most important talks in our list, \u201cThe\nPsychology of Human Misjudgment,\u201d could use \u201ca little revising\u201d to bring it in line with his most current views on\nthe subject.

But I immediately saw four big disadvantages.\n\nFirst, the longer talk, because it was written out with more logical completeness, would be more boring and confusing to many\npeople than any earlier talk. This would happen because I would use idiosyncratic definitions of psychological tendencies ina\nmanner reminiscent of both psychology textbooks and Euclid. And who reads textbooks for fun or revisits Euclid?\n\nSecond, because my formal psychological knowledge came only from skimming three psychology textbooks about 15 years\nago, I know virtually nothing about any academic psychology later developed. Yet in a longer talk containing guesses, I would\nbe criticizing much academic psychology. This sort of intrusion into a professional territory by an amateur would be sure to be\nresented by professors, who would rejoice in finding my errors and might be prompted to respond to my published criticism by\nproviding theirs. Why should I care about new criticism? Well, who likes new hostility from articulate critics with an information\nadvantage?\n\nThird, a longer version of my ideas would surely draw some disapproval from people formerly disposed to liking me. Not only\nwould there be stylistic and substantive objections but also there would be perceptions of arrogance in an old man who displayed\nmuch disregard for conventional wisdom while \u201cpopping off\u201d on a subject in which he had never taken a course. My old Harvard\nLaw classmate, Ed Rothschild, always called such a popping off the shoe-button complex, named for the condition of a family\nfriend who spoke in oracular style on all subjects after becoming dominant in the shoe-button business.\n\nFourth, I might make a fool of myself.\n\f"}, "004029.png": {"text": "Despite these four very considerable objections, I decided to publish the much-expanded version. Thus, after many decades in\nwhich I have succeeded mostly by restricting my action to jobs and methods in which I was unlikely to fail, I have now chosen a\ncourse of action in which 1) I have no significant personal benefit to gain, 2) I will surely give some pain to family members and\nfriends, and 3) I may make myself ridiculous.\n\nWhy am I doing this?\n\nOne reason may be that my nature makes me incline toward diagnosing and talking about errors in conventional wisdom.\n\nAnd despite years of being smoothed out by the hard knocks that were inevitable for one with my attitude, I don\u2019t believe life ever\nknocked all the boy\u2019s brashness out of the man.\n\nAsecond reason for my decision is my approval of the attitude of Diogenes when he asked, \u201cOf what use is a philosopher who\nnever offends anybody?\u201d\n\nMy third and final reason is the strongest. I have fallen in love with my way of laying out psychology because it has been so\nuseful for me. And so, before I die, I want to imitate to some extent the bequest practices of three characters: the protagonist in\nJohn Bunyan\u2019s Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, Benjamin Franklin, and my first employer, Ernest Buffett.\n\nBunyan\u2019s character, the knight wonderfully named Old Valiant-for-Truth, makes the only practical bequest available to him\nwhen he says at the end of his life, \u201cMy sword I leave to him who can wear it.\u201d And like this man, I don\u2019t mind if I have misappraised\nmy sword, provided I have tried to see it correctly, or if many will not wish to try it, or if some who try to wield it may find it serves\nthem not. Ben Franklin, to my great benefit, left behind his autobiography, his Almanacks, and much else. And Ernest Buffett did\nthe best he could in the same mode when he left behind How to Run a Grocery Store and a Few Things I Have Learned about Fishing.\nWhether or not this last contribution to the genre was the best, I will not say. But I will report that I have now known four genera-\n\ntions of Ernest Buffett\u2019s descendants and that the results have encouraged my imitation of the founder.\n\f"}, "004030.png": {"text": "THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HUMAN MISJUDGMENT\n\nIhave long been very interested in standard thinking errors. However, I was educated in an era wherein the contributions of non-\npatient-treating psychology to an understanding of misjudgment met little approval from members of the mainstream elite. In-\nstead, interest in psychology was pretty well confined to a group of professors who talked and published mostly for themselves,\nwith much natural detriment from isolation and groupthink.\n\nAnd so, right after my time at Caltech and Harvard Law School, I possessed a vast ignorance of psychology. Those institutions\nfailed to require knowledge of the subject. And, of course, they couldn't integrate psychology with their other subject matter when\nthey didn\u2019t know psychology. Also, like the Nietzsche character who was proud of his lame leg, the institutions were proud of their\nwillful avoidance of \u201cfuzzy\u201d psychology and \u201cfuzzy\u201d psychology professors.\n\nIshared this ignorant mindset for a considerable time, and so did a lot of other people. What are we to think, for instance, of the\nCaltech course catalog that for years listed just one psychology professor, self-described as a \u201cprofessor of psychoanalytical stud-\nies,\u201d who taught both abnormal psychology and psychoanalysis in literature?\n\nSoon after leaving Harvard, I began a long struggle to get rid of the most dysfunctional part of my psychological ignorance.\nToday, I will describe my long struggle for elementary wisdom and a brief summary of my ending notions. After that, I will give\nexamples, many quite vivid and interesting to me, of both psychology at work and antidotes to psychology-based dysfunction.\nThen I will end by asking and answering some general questions raised by what I have said. This will be a long talk.\n\nWhen I started law practice, I had respect for the power of genetic evolution and an appreciation of man\u2019s many evolution-\nbased resemblances to less cognitively gifted animals and insects. I was aware that man was a social animal, greatly and automat-\n\nically influenced by behavior he observed in men around him. I also knew that man lived, like barnyard animals and monkeys,\n\f"}, "004031.png": {"text": "in limited-size dominance hierarchies, wherein he tended to respect authority and to like and cooperate with his own hierarchy\nmembers while displaying considerable distrust and dislike for competing men not in his own hierarchy.\n\nBut this generalized, evolution-based theory structure was inadequate to enable me to cope properly with the cognition I\nencountered. I was soon surrounded by much extreme irrationality, displayed in patterns and subpatterns. So surrounded, I could\nsee that I was not going to cope as well as I wished with life unless I could acquire a better theory-structure on which to hang my\nobservations and experiences.\n\nBy then, my craving for more theory had a long history. Partly, I had always loved theory as an aid in puzzle-solving and as a\nmeans of satisfying my monkey-like curiosity. And partly, I had found that theory-structure was a superpower in helping one get\nwhat one wanted, as I had early discovered in school, wherein I had excelled without labor, guided by theory, while many others,\nwithout mastery of theory, failed despite monstrous effort. Better theory, I thought, had always worked for me, and, if now avail-\nable, could make me acquire capital and independence faster and better assist everything I loved. So I slowly developed my own\nsystem of psychology, more or less in the self-help style of Ben Franklin and with the determination displayed in the refrain of the\nnursery story: \u201cThen I\u2019ll do it myself? said the Little Red Hen.\u201d\n\nI was greatly helped in my quest by two turns of mind. First, I had long looked for insight by inversion in the intense manner\ncounseled by the great algebraist Jacobi: \u201cInvert, always invert.\u201d I sought good judgment mostly by collecting instances of bad judg-\nment, then pondering ways to avoid such outcomes.\n\nSecond, I became so avid a collector of instances of bad judgment that I paid no attention to boundaries between professional\nterritories. After all, why should I search for some tiny, unimportant, hard-to-find new stupidity in my own field when some large,\nimportant, easy-to-find stupidity was just over the fence in the other fellow\u2019s professional territory? Besides, I could already see\nthat real-world problems didn\u2019t neatly lie within territorial boundaries. They jumped right across. And I was dubious of any ap-\nproach that, when two things were inextricably intertwined and interconnected, would try and think about one thing but not the\nother. I was afraid, if I tried any such restricted approach, that I would end up, in the immortal words of John L. Lewis, \u201cwith no\n\nbrain at all, just a neck that had haired over.\u201d\n\f"}, "004032.png": {"text": "Pure curiosity, somewhat later, made me wonder how and why destructive cults were often able, over a single long weekend, to\nturn many tolerably normal people into brainwashed zombies and thereafter keep them in that state indefinitely. I resolved that I\nwould eventually find a good answer to this cult question if I could do so by general reading and much musing.\n\nTalso got curious about social insects. It fascinated me that both the fertile female honeybee and the fertile female harvester\nant could multiply their quite different normal life expectancies by exactly 20 by engaging in one orgy in the sky. The extreme\nsuccess of the ants also fascinated me\u2014how a few behavioral algorithms caused such extreme evolutionary success grounded in\nextremes of cooperation within the breeding colony and, almost always, extremes of lethal hostility toward ants outside the breed-\ning colony, even ants of the same species.\n\nMotivated as I was, by midlife I should probably have turned to psychology textbooks. But I didn\u2019t, displaying my share of the\noutcome predicted by the German folk saying \u201cWe are too soon old and too late smart.\u201d However, as I later found out, I may have\nbeen lucky to avoid for so long the academic psychology that was then laid out in most textbooks. These would not have guided me\nwell with respect to cults and were often written as if the authors were collecting psychology experiments as a boy collects butter-\nflies\u2014with a passion for more butterflies and more contact with fellow collectors and little craving for synthesis in what is already\npossessed.\n\nWhen I finally got to the psychology texts, I was reminded of the observation of Jacob Viner, the great economist, that many\nan academic is like the truffle hound, an animal so trained and bred for one narrow purpose that it is no good at anything else. I\nwas also appalled by the hundreds of pages of extremely nonscientific musing about comparative weights of nature and nurture\nin human outcomes. And I found that introductory psychology texts, by and large, didn\u2019t deal appropriately with a fundamental\nissue: Psychological tendencies tend to be both numerous and inseparably intertwined, now and forever, as they interplay in life.\nYet the complex parsing out of effects from intertwined tendencies was usually avoided by the writers of the elementary texts.\n\nPossibly the authors did not wish, through complexity, to repel entry of new devotees to their discipline. And possibly, the cause\nof their inadequacy was the one given by Samuel Johnson in response to a woman who inquired as to what accounted for his dic-\n\ntionary\u2019s mis-definition of the word \u201cpastern.\u201d \u201cPure ignorance,\u201d Johnson replied. Finally, the text writers showed little interest in\n\f"}, "004033.png": {"text": "describing standard antidotes to standard psychology-driven folly, and they thus avoided most discussion of exactly what most\ninterested me.\n\nBut academic psychology has some very important merits alongside its defects. I learned this eventually in the course of\ngeneral reading from a book, Influence, aimed at a popular audience by a distinguished psychology professor, Robert Cialdini at\nArizona State, a very big university. Cialdini had made himself into a super-tenured regents professor at a very young age by de-\nvising, describing, and explaining a vast group of clever experiments in which man manipulated man to his detriment, with all of\nthis made possible by man\u2019s intrinsic thinking flaws.\n\nlimmediately sent copies of Cialdini\u2019s book to all my children. I also gave Cialdini a share of Berkshire stock (Class A) to thank\nhim for what he had done for me and the public. Incidentally, the sale by Cialdini of hundreds of thousands of copies of a book\nabout social psychology was a huge feat, considering that Cialdini didn\u2019t claim that he was going to improve your sex life or make\nyou any money.\n\nPart of Cialdini\u2019s large book-buying audience came because, like me, it wanted to learn how to become less often tricked by\nsalesmen and circumstances. However, as an outcome not sought by Cialdini, who is a profoundly ethical man, a huge number of\nhis books were bought by salesmen who wanted to learn how to become more effective in misleading customers. Please remember\nthis perverse outcome when my discussion comes to incentive-caused bias as a consequence of the superpower of incentives.\n\nWith the push given by Cialdini\u2019s book, I soon skimmed through three much-used textbooks covering introductory psychology.\nalso pondered considerably while craving synthesis and taking into account all my previous training and experience. The result\n\u2018was Munger\u2019s partial summary of the non-patient-treating, non-nature versus nurture weighing parts of non-developmental\npsychology. This material was stolen from its various discoverers (most of whose names I did not even try to learn), often with\nnew descriptions and titles selected to fit Munger\u2019s notion of what makes recall easy for Munger, then revised to make Munger\u2019s use\neasy as he seeks to avoid errors.\n\nI will start my summary with a general observation that helps explain what follows. This observation is grounded in what we\n\nknow about social insects. The limitations inherent in evolution\u2019s development of the nervous system cells that control behavior\n\f"}, "004034.png": {"text": "are beautifully demonstrated by these insects, which often have a mere 100,000 or so cells in their entire nervous systems, com-\npared to man\u2019s multiple billions of cells in his brain alone.\n\nEach ant, like each human, is composed of a living physical structure, plus behavioral algorithms in its nerve cells. In the ant\u2019s\ncase, the behavioral algorithms are few in number and almost entirely genetic in origin. The ant learns a little behavior from expe-\nriences, but mostly it merely responds to 10 or so stimuli with a few simple responses programmed into its nervous system by its\ngenes.\n\nNaturally, the simple ant behavior system has extreme limitations because of its limited nerve-system repertoire. For instance,\none type of ant, when it smells a pheromone given off by a dead ant\u2019s body in the hive, immediately responds by cooperating with\nother ants in carrying the dead body out of the hive. Harvard\u2019s great E.O. Wilson performed one of the best psychology experi-\nments ever done when he painted dead ant pheromone on a live ant. Quite naturally, the other ants dragged this useful live ant out\nof the hive even though it kicked and otherwise protested throughout the entire process. Such is the brain of the ant. It has a sim-\nple program of responses that generally work out all right but which are imprudently used by rote in many cases.\n\nAnother type of ant demonstrates that the limited brain of ants can be misled by circumstances as well as by clever manipula-\ntion from other creatures. The brain of this ant contains a simple behavioral program that directs the ant, when walking, to follow\nthe ant ahead. And when these ants stumble into walking in a big circle, they sometimes walk round and round until they perish.\n\nIt seems obvious, to me at least, that the human brain must often operate counterproductively, just like the ant\u2019s, from un-\navoidable oversimplicity in its mental process, albeit usually in trying to solve problems more difficult than those faced by ants\nthat don\u2019t have to design airplanes. The perception system of man clearly demonstrates just such an unfortunate outcome. Man is\neasily fooled, either by the cleverly thought-out manipulation of man, by circumstances occurring by accident, or by very effective\nmanipulation practices that man has stumbled into during \u201cpractice evolution\u201d and kept in place because they work so well.\n\nOne such outcome is caused by a quantum effect in human perception. If stimulus is kept below a certain level, it does not get\nthrough. And for this reason, a magician was able to make the Statue of Liberty \u201cdisappear\u201d after a certain amount of magician\n\nlingo expressed in the dark. The audience was not aware that it was sitting on a platform that was rotating so slowly, below man\u2019s\n\f"}, "004035.png": {"text": "sensory threshold, that no one could feel the acceleration implicit in the considerable rotation. When a surrounding curtain was\nthen opened in the place on the platform where the statue had earlier appeared, it seemed to have disappeared.\n\nEven when perception does get through to man\u2019s brain, it is often misweighted, because what is registered in perception is in\nthe shockingness of apparent contrast, not the standard scientific units that make possible science and good engineering.\n\nA magician demonstrates this sort of contrast-based error in your nervous system when he removes your wristwatch without\nyour feeling it. As he does this, he applies pressure of touch on your wrist that you would sense if it was the only pressure of touch\nyou were experiencing. But he has concurrently applied other intense pressure of touch on your body, but not on your wrist,\n\u201cswamping\u201d the wrist pressure by creating a high-contrast touch pressure elsewhere. This high contrast takes the wrist pressure\nbelow perception.\n\nSome psychology professors like to demonstrate the inadequacy of contrast-based perception by having students put one hand\nin a bucket of hot water and one hand in a bucket of cold water. They are then suddenly asked to remove both hands and place\nthem in a single bucket of room-temperature water. Now, with both hands in the same water, one hand feels as if it has just been\nput in cold water and the other hand feels as if it has just been placed in hot water.\n\nWhen one thus sees perception so easily fooled by mere contrast, where a simple temperature gauge would make no error, and\nrealizes that cognition mimics perception in being misled by mere contrast, he is well on the way toward understanding not only\nhow magicians fool one but also how life will fool one. This can occur, through deliberate human manipulation or otherwise, if\none doesn\u2019t take certain precautions against often wrong effects from generally useful tendencies in his perception and cognition.\n\nMan\u2019s often wrong but generally useful psychological tendencies are quite numerous and quite different. The natural con-\nsequence of this profusion of tendencies is the grand general principle of social psychology: Cognition is ordinarily situation-\ndependent, so that different situations often cause different conclusions, even when the same person is thinking in the same gen-\n\neral subject area.\n\f"}, "004036.png": {"text": "With this introductory instruction from ants, magicians, and the grand general principle of social psychology, I will next\nsimply number and list psychology-based tendencies that, while generally useful, often mislead.

But this is not often so. For instance, I think I\u2019ve been in the top 5 percent of\nmy age cohort almost all my adult life in understanding the power of incentives, yet I\u2019ve always underestimated that power. Never\na year passes but I get some surprise that pushes a little further my appreciation of incentive superpower.\n\nOne of my favorite cases about the power of incentives is the Federal Express case. The integrity of the Federal Express system\nrequires that all packages be shifted rapidly among airplanes in one central airport each night. The system has no integrity for the\n\ncustomers if the night work shift can\u2019t accomplish its assignment fast. And Federal Express had one hell of a time getting the night\n\f"}, "004038.png": {"text": "shift to do the right thing. They tried moral suasion. They tried everything in the world without luck. And finally, somebody got\nthe happy thought that it was foolish to pay the night shift by the hour when what the employer wanted was not maximized bill-\nable hours of employee service but fault-free, rapid performance of a particular task. Maybe, this person thought, if they paid the\nemployees per shift and let all night shift employees go home when all the planes were loaded, the system would work better. And,\nlo and behold, that solution worked.\n\nEarly in the history of Xerox, Joe Wilson, who was then in the government, had a similar experience. He had to go back to Xerox\nbecause he couldn\u2019t understand why its new machine was selling so poorly in relation to its older and inferior machine. When he\ngot back to Xerox, he found out that the commission arrangement with the salesmen gave a large and perverse incentive to push\nthe inferior machine on customers, who deserved a better result.\n\nThen there is the case of Mark Twain\u2019s cat that, after a bad experience with a hot stove, never again sat on a hot stove, or acold\nstove either.\n\nWe should also heed the general lesson implicit in the injunction of Ben Franklin in Poor Richard\u2019s Almanack: \u201cIf you would per-\nsuade, appeal to interest and not to reason.\u201d\n\nThis maxim is a wise guide to a great and simple precaution in life: Never, ever, think about something else when you should\nbe thinking about the power of incentives. I once saw a very smart house counsel for a major investment bank lose his job, with\nno moral fault, because he ignored the lesson in this maxim of Franklin. This counsel failed to persuade his client because he told\nhim his moral duty, as correctly conceived by the counsel, without also telling the client in vivid terms that he was very likely to be\nclobbered to smithereens if he didn\u2019t behave as his counsel recommended. As a result, both client and counsel lost their careers.\n\nWe should also remember how a foolish and willful ignorance of the superpower of rewards caused Soviet communists to get\ntheir final result, as described by one employee: \u201cThey pretend to pay us, and we pretend to work.\u201d Perhaps the most important\nrule in management is \u201cGet the incentives right.\u201d\n\nBut there is some limit to a desirable emphasis on incentive superpower. One case of excess emphasis happened at Harvard,\n\nwhere B. F. Skinner, a psychology professor, finally made himself ridiculous. At one time, Skinner may have been the best-known\n\f"}, "004039.png": {"text": "psychology professor in the world. He partly deserved his peak reputation because his early experiments using rats and pigeons\nwere ingenious, and his results were both counterintuitive and important. With incentives, he could cause more behavior change,\nculminating in conditioned reflexes in his rats and pigeons, than he could in any other way. He made obvious the extreme stu-\npidity, in dealing with children or employees, of rewarding behavior one didn\u2019t want more of. Using food rewards, he even caused\nstrong superstitions, predesigned by himself, in his pigeons. He demonstrated, again and again, a great recurring generalized be-\nhavioral algorithm in nature: \u201cRepeat behavior that works.\u201d\n\nHe also demonstrated that prompt rewards worked much better than delayed rewards in changing and maintaining behavior.\nAnd once his rats and pigeons had conditioned reflexes caused by food rewards, he found what withdrawal pattern of rewards kept\nthe reflexive behavior longest in place: random distribution. With this result, Skinner thought he had pretty well explained man\u2019s\nmisgambling compulsion, whereunder he often foolishly proceeds to ruin. But as we shall later see when we discuss other psycho-\nlogical tendencies that contribute to misgambling compulsion, he was only partly right.\n\nLater, Skinner lost most of his personal reputation by 1) overclaiming for incentive superpower, to the point of thinking he\ncould create a human utopia with it, and 2) displaying hardly any recognition of the power of the rest of psychology. He thus be-\nhaved like one of Jacob Viner\u2019s truffle hounds as he tried to explain everything with incentive effects.\n\nNonetheless, Skinner was right in his main idea: Incentives are superpowers. The outcome of his basic experiments will always\nremain in high repute in the annals of experimental science.\n\nWhen I was at Harvard Law School, the professors sometimes talked about an overfocused, Skinner-like professor at Yale Law\nSchool. They used to say, \u201cPoor old Eddie Blanchard, he thinks declaratory judgments will cure cancer.\u201d Well, that\u2019s the way Skinner\ngot with his very extreme emphasis on incentive superpower. I always call the Johnny-one-note turn of mind that eventually so\ndiminished Skinner\u2019s reputation the man-with-a-hammer tendency, after the folk saying \u201cTo a man with only a hammer, every\n\nproblem looks pretty much like a nail.\u201d\n\f"}, "004040.png": {"text": " \n\nMan-with-a-hammer tendency does not exempt smart people like Blanchard and Skinner. And it won\u2019t exempt you if you don\u2019t\nwatch out. I will return to man-with-a-hammer tendency at various times in this talk because, fortunately, there are effective anti-\ndotes that reduce the ravages of what pretty much ruined the personal reputation of the brilliant Skinner.\n\nOne of the most important consequences of incentive superpower is what I call incentive-caused bias. A man has an accultur-\nated nature, making him a pretty decent fellow, and yet, driven both consciously and subconsciously by incentives, he drifts into\nimmoral behavior in order to get what he wants\u2014a result he facilitates by rationalizing his bad behavior, like the salesmen at\nXerox who harmed customers in order to maximize their sales commissions.\n\nHere, my early education involved a surgeon who, over the years, sent bushel baskets full of normal gallbladders down to the\npathology lab in the leading hospital in Lincoln, Nebraska, my grandfather\u2019s town. And, with that permissive quality control for\nwhich community hospitals are famous, many years after this surgeon should\u2019ve been removed from the medical staff, he was.\n\nOne of the doctors who participated in the removal was a family friend, and I asked him, \u201cDid this surgeon think, \u2018Here\u2019s a way\nfor me to exercise my talents\u201d\u201d\u2014this guy was very skilled technically\u2014\u201cand make a high living by doing a few maimings and mur-\nders every year in the course of routine fraud?\u201d And my friend answered, \u201cHell no, Charlie. He thought that the gallbladder was the\nsource of all medical evil, and if you really loved your patients, you couldn't get that organ out rapidly enough.\u201d\n\nNow, that\u2019s an extreme case, but in lesser strength, the cognitive drift of that surgeon is present in every profession and in every\nhuman being. And it causes perfectly terrible behavior. Consider the presentations of brokers selling commercial real estate and\nbusinesses. I\u2019ve never seen one that I thought was even within hailing distance of objective truth. In my long life, I have never\nseen a management consultant's report that didn\u2019t end with the same advice: \u201cThis problem needs more management consulting\nservices.\u201d\n\nWidespread incentive-caused bias requires that one should often distrust or take with a grain of salt the advice of one\u2019s profes-\nsional adviser, even if he is an engineer. The general antidotes here are: 1) Especially fear professional advice when it is especially\ngood for the adviser, 2) learn and use the basic elements of your adviser\u2019s trade as you deal with your adviser, and 3) double-check,\n\ndisbelieve, or replace much of what you're told, to the degree that seems appropriate after objective thought.\n\f"}, "004041.png": {"text": "The power of incentives to cause rationalized terrible behavior is also demonstrated by Defense Department procurement\nhistory. After the Defense Department had much truly awful experience with misbehaving contractors motivated under contracts\npaying on a cost-plus-percentage of cost basis, the reaction of our republic was to make it a crime for a contracting officer in the\nDefense Department to sign such a contract\u2014and not only a crime but a felony. And by the way, although the government was\nright to create this new felony, much of the way the rest of the world is run, including the operation of many law firms and a lot of\nother firms, is still under what is, in essence, a cost-plus-percentage of cost reward system.\n\nHuman nature, bedeviled by incentive-caused bias, causes a lot of ghastly abuse under these standard incentive patterns of the\nworld. And many of the people who are behaving terribly you would be glad to have married into your family, compared to what\nyou're otherwise likely to get.\n\nNow, there are huge implications from the fact that the human mind is put together this way. One implication is that people\nwho create things like cash registers, which make dishonest behavior hard to accomplish, are some of the effective saints of our\ncivilization because, as Skinner so well knew, bad behavior is intensely habit-forming when it is rewarded. And so the cash register\nwas a great moral instrument when it was created.\n\nAnd by the way, Patterson, the great evangelist of the cash register, knew that from his own experience. He had a little store,\nand his employees were stealing him blind, so that he never made any money. Then people sold him a couple of cash registers, and\nhis store went to profit immediately. He promptly closed the store and went into the cash register business, creating what became\nthe mighty National Cash Register company, one of the glories of its time.\n\n\u201cRepeat behavior that works\u201d is a behavioral guide that really succeeded for Patterson, after he applied one added twist.

Perhaps the most important of these antidotes is the use of sound accounting theory\nand practice. This was seldom better demonstrated than at Westinghouse, which had a subsidiary that made loans having no\nconnection to the rest of Westinghouse\u2019s businesses. The officers of Westinghouse, perhaps influenced by envy of General Electric,\nwanted to expand profits from loans to outsiders. Under Westinghouse\u2019s accounting practice, provisions for future credit losses\non these loans depended largely on the past credit experience of its lending subsidiary, which mainly made loans unlikely to cause\nmassive losses.\n\nNow, there are two special classes of loans that naturally cause much trouble for lenders. The first is 95 percent-of-value\nconstruction loans to any kind of real estate developer, and the second is any kind of construction loan on a hotel. So, naturally, if\none was willing to loan approximately 95 percent of the real cost to a developer constructing a hotel, the loan would bear a much\nhigher than normal interest rate because the credit loss danger would be much higher than normal. So, sound accounting for\nWestinghouse in making a big, new mass of 95 percent-of-value construction loans to hotel developers would have been to report\nalmost no profit, or even a loss, on each loan until, years later, the loan became clearly worth par.\n\nBut Westinghouse instead plunged into big-time construction lending on hotels, using accounting that made its lending\nofficers look good because it showed extremely high starting income from loans that were very inferior to the loans from which\nthe company had suffered small credit losses in the past. This terrible accounting was allowed by both international and outside\naccountants for Westinghouse as they displayed the conduct predicted by the refrain \u201cWhose bread I eat, his song I sing.\u201d The re-\n\nsult was billions of dollars of losses.\n\n \n\nWho was at fault? The guy from the refrigerator division, or some similar division, who as lending officer was suddenly in\ncharge of loans to hotel developers? Or the accountants and other senior people who tolerated a nearly insane incentive structure,\nalmost sure to trigger incentive-caused bias in a lending officer? My answer puts the most blame on the accountants and other\n\nsenior people who created the accounting system. These people became the equivalent of an armored car cash-carrying service\n\f"}, "004043.png": {"text": "that suddenly decided to dispense with vehicles and have unarmed children hand-carry its customers\u2019 cash through slums in open\nbushel baskets.\n\nI wish I could tell you that this sort of thing no longer happens, but this is not so. After Westinghouse blew up, General Electric\u2019s\nKidder, Peabody subsidiary put a silly computer program in place that allowed a bond trader to show immense fictional profits.\nAnd after that, much accounting became even worse, perhaps reaching its nadir at Enron.\n\nSo incentive-caused bias is a huge, important thing, with highly important antidotes, like the cash register and a sound ac-\ncounting system. But when I came years ago to the psychology texts, I found that, while they were about 1,000 pages long, there\nwas little therein that dealt with incentive-caused bias and no mention of Patterson or sound accounting systems.\n\nSomehow incentive-caused bias and its antidotes pretty well escaped the standard survey courses in psychology, even though\nincentive-caused bias had long been displayed prominently in much of the world\u2019s great literature, and antidotes to it had long\nexisted in standard business routines. In the end, I concluded that when something was obvious in life but not easily demonstra-\nble in certain kinds of easy-to-do, repeatable academic experiments, the truffle hounds of psychology very often missed it.\n\nIn some cases, other disciplines showed more interest in psychological tendencies than did psychology, at least as explicated in\npsychology textbooks. For instance, economists, speaking from the employer's point of view, have long had a name for the natural\nresults of incentive-caused bias: agency cost.\n\nAs the name implies, economists have typically known that, just as grain is always lost to rats, employers always lose to employ-\nees who improperly think of themselves first. Employer-installed antidotes include tough internal audit systems and severe public\npunishment for identified miscreants, as well as misbehavior-preventing routines and such machines as cash registers. From the\nemployee's point of view, incentive-caused bias quite naturally causes opposing abuse from the employer: the sweatshop, the un-\nsafe workplace, etc. And these bad results for employees have antidotes not only in pressure from unions but also in government\naction, such as wage and hour laws, workplace safety rules, measures fostering unionization, and workers\u2019 compensation systems.\nGiven the opposing psychology-induced strains that naturally occur in employment because of incentive-caused bias on both\n\nsides of the relationshi\n\n \n\nis no wonder the Chinese are so much into yin and yang.\n\f"}, "004044.png": {"text": "The inevitable ubiquity of incentive-caused bias has vast, generalized consequences. For instance, a sales force living only on\ncommissions will be much harder to keep moral than one under less pressure from the compensation arrangement. On the other\nhand, a purely commissioned sales force may well be more efficient per dollar spent. Therefore, difficult decisions involving trade-\noffs are common in creating compensation arrangements in the sales function.\n\nThe extreme success of free-market capitalism as an economic system owes much to its prevention of many bad effects from\nincentive-caused bias. Most capitalist owners in a vast web of free-market economic activity are selected for ability by surviving\nin a brutal competition with other owners and have a strong incentive to prevent all waste in operations within their ownership.\nAfter all, they live on the difference between their competitive prices and their overall costs, and their businesses will perish if\ncosts exceed sales. Replace such owners by salaried employees of the state and you will normally get a substantial reduction in\noverall efficiency, as each employee who replaces an owner is subject to incentive-caused bias as he determines what service he\nwill give in exchange for his salary and how much he will yield to peer pressure from many fellow employees who do not desire his\ncreation of any strong performance model.\n\nAnother generalized consequence of incentive-caused bias is that man tends to game all human systems, often displaying great\ningenuity in wrongly serving himself at the expense of others. Anti-gaming features, therefore, constitute a huge and necessary\npart of almost all system design.\n\nAlso needed in system design is an admonition: Dread, and avoid as much you can, rewarding people for what can be easily\nfaked. Yet our legislators and judges, usually including many lawyers educated in eminent universities, often ignore this injunc-\ntion. Society consequently pays a huge price in the deterioration of behavior and efficiency, as well as the incurrence of unfair costs\nand wealth transfers. If education were improved, with psychological reality becoming better taught and assimilated, better sys-\ntem design might well come out of our legislatures and courts.\n\nOf course, money is now the main reward that drives habits. A monkey can be trained to seek and work for an intrinsically\nworthless token as if it were a banana if the token is routinely exchangeable for a banana. So it is with humans working for money,\n\nonly more so, because human money is exchangeable for many desired things in addition to food, and one ordinarily gains sta-\n\f"}, "004045.png": {"text": "tus from either holding or spending it. Moreover, a rich person will often, through habit, work or connive energetically for more\nmoney long after he has almost no real need for more. Averaged out, money is a mainspring of modern civilization, having little\nprecedent in the behavior of nonhuman animals. Money rewards are also intertwined with other forms of reward. For instance,\nsome people use money to buy status, and others use status to get money, while still others sort of do both things at the same time.\n\nAlthough money is the main driver among rewards, it is not the only reward that works. People also change their behavior and\ncognition for sex, friendship, companionship, advancement in status, and other nonmonetary items.\n\n\u201cGranny\u2019s rule\u201d provides another example of reward superpower, so extreme in its effects that it must be mentioned here. You\ncan successfully manipulate your own behavior with this rule, even if you are using as rewards items that you already possess!\nIndeed, consultant PhD psychologists often urge business organizations to improve their reward systems by teaching executives\nto use \u201cgranny\u2019s rule\u201d to govern their own daily behavior.\n\nGranny\u2019s rule, to be specific, is the requirement that children eat their carrots before they get dessert. The business version\nrequires that executives force themselves daily to first do their unpleasant and necessary tasks before rewarding themselves by\nproceeding to their pleasant tasks. Given reward superpower, this practice is wise and sound. Moreover, the rule can also be used\nin the non-business part of life. The emphasis on daily use of this practice is not accidental. The consultants well know, after the\nteaching of Skinner, that prompt rewards work best.\n\nPunishments, of course, also strongly influence behavior and cognition, although not so flexibly and wonderfully as rewards.\nFor instance, illegal price fixing was fairly common in America when it was customarily punished by modest fines. Then, after a\nfew prominent business executives were removed from their eminent positions and sent to federal prisons, price-fixing behavior\nwas greatly reduced.\n\nMilitary and naval organizations have very often been extreme in using punishment to change behavior, probably because\nthey needed to cause extreme behavior. Around the time of Caesar, there was a European tribe that, when the assembly horn blew,\nalways killed the last warrior to reach his assigned place, and no one enjoyed fighting this tribe.

Perhaps the strongest inborn tendency to love, ready to be triggered, is that of the human mother for its child. On the other\nhand, the similar child-loving behavior of a mouse can be eliminated by the deletion of a single gene, which suggests there is some\nsort of triggering gene in a mother mouse as well as in a gosling.\n\nEach child, like a gosling, will almost surely come to like and love, not only as driven by its sexual nature but also in social\ngroups not limited to its genetic or adoptive family.

For instance, a man who is so constructed that he loves admirable persons and ideas with a special\nintensity has a huge advantage in life.

After all, the\none thing that is surely counterproductive for a prey animal that is threatened by a predator is to take a long time in deciding what\n\nto do.

And the mask works to help real objectivity along, as we shall\nsee when we next consider man\u2019s inconsistency-avoidance tendency.\n\nOf course, once one has recognized that man has a strong doubt-avoidance tendency, it is logical to believe that at least some\nleaps of religious faith are greatly boosted by this tendency. Even if one is satisfied that his own faith comes from revelation, one\nmust still account for the inconsistent faiths of others. And man\u2019s doubt-avoidance tendency is almost surely a big part of the\nanswer.\n\nWhat triggers doubt-avoidance tendency? Well, an unthreatened man, thinking of nothing in particular, is not being prompted\nto remove doubt through rushing to some decision. As we shall see later when we get to social-proof tendency and stress-influence\ntendency, what usually triggers doubt-avoidance tendency is some combination of 1) puzzlement and 2) stress.

We see\nthis in all human habits, constructive and destructive. Few people can list a lot of bad habits that they have eliminated, and some\npeople cannot identify even one of these. Instead, practically everyone has a great many bad habits he has long maintained despite\n\ntheir being known as bad.\n\f"}, "004050.png": {"text": "Given this situation, it is not too much in many cases to appraise early-formed habits as destiny. When Marley\u2019s miserable ghost\n[in A Christmas Carol] says, \u201cI wear the chains I forged in life,\u201d he is talking about the chains of habit that were too light to be felt be-\nfore they became too strong to be broken.\n\nThe rare life that is wisely lived has in it many good habits maintained and many bad habits avoided or cured. The great rule\nthat helps here is again from Franklin\u2019s Poor Richard\u2019s Almanack: \u201cAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d What Franklin\nis here indicating, in part, is that inconsistency-avoidance tendency makes it much easier to prevent a habit than to change it.\n\nAlso tending to be maintained in place by the anti-change tendency of the brain are one\u2019s previous conclusions, human loyal-\nties, reputational identity, commitments, accepted role in a civilization, etc. It is not entirely clear why evolution would program\ninto man\u2019s brain an anti-change mode alongside his tendency to quickly remove doubt. My guess is the anti-change mode was sig-\n\nnificantly caused by a combination of the following factors:\n\n1. It facilitated faster decisions when speed of decision was an important contribution to the survival of nonhuman ancestors\nthat were prey.\n\n2. It facilitated the survival advantage that our ancestors gained by cooperating in groups, which would have been more difficult\nto do if everyone was always changing responses.\n\n3. It was the best form of solution that evolution could get to in the limited number of generations between the start of literacy\n\nand today\u2019s complex modern life.\n\nIt is easy to see that a quickly reached conclusion, triggered by doubt-avoidance tendency, when combined with a tendency to\nresist any change in that conclusion, will naturally cause a lot of errors in cognition for modern man.

For instance, before making decisions, judges and juries are required to hear long and skillful presentations of\nevidence and arguments from the side they will not naturally favor, given their ideas in place. This helps prevent considerable bad\nthinking from first-conclusion bias. Similarly, other modern decision-makers will often force groups to consider skillful counter-\narguments before making decisions.\n\nProper education is one long exercise in the augmentation of high cognition so that our wisdom becomes strong enough to\ndestroy wrong thinking maintained by resistance to change. As Lord Keynes pointed out about his exalted intellectual group at\none of the greatest universities in the world, it was not the intrinsic difficulty of new ideas that prevented their acceptance. In-\nstead, the new ideas were not accepted because they were inconsistent with old ideas in place.\n\nWhat Keynes was reporting is that the human mind works a lot like the human egg. When one sperm gets into a human egg,\nthere\u2019s an automatic shut-off device that bars any other sperm from getting in. The human mind tends strongly toward the same\nsort of result. And so, people tend to accumulate large mental holdings of fixed conclusions and attitudes that are not often reex-\namined or changed, even though there is plenty of good evidence that they are wrong.\n\nMoreover, this doesn\u2019t just happen in social science departments, like the one that once thought Freud should serve as the only\nchoice as a psychology teacher for Caltech. Holding to old errors even happens, although with less frequency and severity, in hard\nscience departments. We have no less an authority for this than Max Planck, Nobel laureate, finder of Planck\u2019s constant. Planck is\nfamous not only for his science but also for saying that even in physics the radically new ideas are seldom really accepted by the old\nguard. Instead, said Planck, progress is made by a new generation that comes along, less brain-blocked by its previous conclusions.\n\nIndeed, precisely this sort of brain blocking happened to a degree in Einstein. At his peak, Einstein was a great destroyer of his\nown ideas, but an older Einstein never accepted the full implications of quantum mechanics.\n\nOne of the most successful users of an antidote to first-conclusion bias was Charles Darwin. He trained himself, early, to inten-\nsively consider any evidence tending to disconfirm any hypothesis of his, more so if he thought his hypothesis was a particularly\n\ngood one.

For instance, rather than act inconsistently with\npublic commitments, new or old public identities, etc., most people are more loyal in their roles in life as priests, physicians, citi-\nzens, soldiers, spouses, teachers, employees, etc.\n\nOne corollary of inconsistency-avoidance tendency is that a person making big sacrifices in the course of assuming a new\nidentity will intensify his devotion to the new identity. After all, it would be quite inconsistent behavior to make a large sacrifice\nfor something that was no good. Thus civilization has invented many tough and solemn initiation ceremonies, often public in na-\nture, that intensify new commitments made.\n\nTough initiation ceremonies can intensify bad conduct as well as good. The loyalty of the new made-man mafia member or of\nthe military officer making the required blood oath of loyalty to Hitler was boosted through the triggering of inconsistency-avoid-\nance tendency.\n\nMoreover, the tendency will often make man a patsy of manipulative compliance practitioners, who gain advantage from\ntriggering his subconscious inconsistency-avoidance tendency. Few people demonstrated this process better than Ben Franklin.\nAs he was rising from obscurity in Philadelphia and wanted the approval of some important man, Franklin would often maneuver\nthat man into doing Franklin some unimportant favor, like lending Franklin a book. Thereafter, the man would admire and trust\nFranklin more because a non-admired and non-trusted Franklin would be inconsistent with the appraisal implicit in lending\nFranklin the book.\n\nDuring the Korean War, this technique of Franklin\u2019s was the most important feature of the Chinese brainwashing system that\nwas used on enemy prisoners. Small step by small step, the technique often worked better than torture in altering prisoner cogni-\ntion in favor of Chinese captors.\n\nThe practice of Franklin, whereunder he got approval from someone by maneuvering him into treating Franklin favorably,\n\nworks viciously well in reverse.

When such\npower flows into political and cult evangelism, there are often bad consequences.\n\nFor instance, modern education often does much damage when young students are taught dubious political notions and then\nenthusiastically push these notions on the rest of us. The pushing seldom convinces others. But as students pound into their men-\ntal habits what they are pushing out, the students are often permanently damaged. Educational institutions that create a climate\nwhere much of this goes on are, I think, irresponsible.

Wilson once waggishly suggested that if ants were suddenly to get atom bombs, all ants would be dead within 18 hours.\n\nWhat both human and ant history suggest is that 1) nature has no general algorithm making intraspecies, turn-the-other-\ncheek behavior a booster of species survival; 2) it is not clear that a country would have good prospects were it to abandon all recip-\nrocate-disfavor tendency directed at outsiders; and 3) if turn-the-other-cheek behavior is a good idea for a country as it deals with\noutsiders, man\u2019s culture is going to have to do a lot of heavy lifting because his genes won't be of much help.\n\nInext turn to man\u2019s reciprocated hostility that falls well short of war. Peacetime hostility can be pretty extreme, as in many\nmodern cases of road rage or injury-producing temper tantrums on athletic fields. The standard antidote to one\u2019s overactive hostil-\nity is to train oneself to defer reaction. As my smart friend Tom Murphy so frequently says, \u201cYou can always tell the man off tomor-\nrow, if it is such a good idea.\u201d\n\nOf course, the tendency to reciprocate favor for favor is also very intense, so much so that it occasionally reverses the course\nof reciprocated hostility. Weird pauses in fighting have sometimes occurred right in the middle of wars, triggered by some minor\n\ncourtesy or favor on the part of one side, followed by favor reciprocation from the other side, and so on, until fighting stopped for a\n\f"}, "004058.png": {"text": "considerable period. This happened more than once in the trench warfare of World War I, over big stretches of the front and much\nto the dismay of the generals.\n\nIt is obvious that commercial trade, a fundamental cause of modern prosperity, is enormously facilitated by man\u2019s innate ten-\ndency to reciprocate favors. In trade, enlightened self-interest joining with reciprocation tendency results in constructive conduct.\nDaily interchange in marriage is also assisted by reciprocation tendency, without which marriage would lose much of its allure.\n\nReciprocation tendency, insomuch as it causes good results, does not join forces only with the superpower of incentives. It also\njoins inconsistency-avoidance tendency in helping cause 1) the fulfillment of promises made as part of a bargain, including loyalty\npromises in marriage ceremonies; and 2) correct behavior expected from persons serving as priests, shoemakers, physicians, and\nall else.\n\nLike other psychological tendencies, and also man\u2019s ability to turn somersaults, reciprocate-favor tendency operates to a very\nconsiderable degree at a subconscious level. This helps make the tendency a strong force that can sometimes be used by some men\nto mislead others, which happens all the time. For instance, when an automobile salesman graciously steers you into a comfort-\nable place to sit and gives you a cup of coffee, you are very likely being tricked, by this small courtesy alone, into parting with an\nextra $500. This is far from the most extreme case of sales success that is rooted in a salesman dispensing minor favors. However,\nin this scenario of buying a car, you are going to be disadvantaged by parting with an extra $500 of your own money. This poten-\ntial loss will protect you to some extent.\n\nBut suppose you are the purchasing agent of someone else\u2014a rich employer, for instance. Now, the minor favor you receive\nfrom the salesman is less opposed by the threat of extra cost to you because someone else is paying the extra cost. Under such cir-\ncumstances, the salesman is often able to maximize his advantage, particularly when the government is the purchaser.\n\nWise employers, therefore, try to oppose the reciprocate-favor tendencies of employees engaged in purchasing. The simplest\n\nantidote works best: Don't let them accept any favors from vendors.\n\f"}, "004059.png": {"text": "Sam Walton agreed with this idea of absolute prohibition. He wouldn\u2019t let purchasing agents accept so much as a hot dog from\na vendor. Given the subconscious level at which much reciprocation tendency operates, this policy of Walton\u2019s was profoundly cor-\nrect. If I controlled the Defense Department, its policies would mimic Waltons.\n\nIna famous psychology experiment, Cialdini brilliantly demonstrated the power of compliance practitioners to mislead people\nby triggering their subconscious reciprocation tendency. Carrying out this experiment, Cialdini caused his compliance practition-\ners to wander around his campus and ask strangers to supervise a bunch of juvenile delinquents on a trip to a zoo. Because this\nhappened on a campus, one person in six out of a large sample actually agreed to do this. After accumulating this 1-in-6 statistic,\nCialdini changed his procedure. His practitioners next wandered around the campus asking strangers to devote a big chunk of\ntime every week for two years to the supervision of juvenile delinquents. This ridiculous request got him a 100 percent rejection\n\nrate. But the practitioner had a follow-up questio!\n\n \n\n\u201cWill you at least spend one afternoon taking juvenile delinquents to a zoo?\u201d\nThis raised Cialdini\u2019s former acceptance rate of 1 in 6 to 1 in 2\u2014a tripling.\n\nWhat Cialdini\u2019s compliance practitioners had done was make a small concession, which was reciprocated by a small concession\nfrom the other side. This subconscious reciprocation of a concession by Cialdini\u2019s experimental subjects actually caused a much-\nincreased percentage of them to end up irrationally agreeing to go to a zoo with juvenile delinquents. Now, a professor who can in-\nvent an experiment like that, which so powerfully demonstrates something so important, deserves much recognition in the wider\nworld, which he indeed got, to the credit of many universities that learned a great deal from Cialdini.\n\nWhy is reciprocation tendency so important? Well, consider the folly of having law students graduate and go out in the world\nrepresenting clients in negotiations, not knowing the nature of the subconscious processes of the mind as exhibited in Cialdini\u2019s\nexperiment. Yet such folly was prevalent in the law schools of the world for decades, in fact generations. The correct name for that\nis educational malpractice. The law schools didn\u2019t know, or care to teach, what Sam Walton so well knew.\n\nThe importance and power of reciprocate-favor tendency was also demonstrated in Cialdini\u2019s explanation of the foolish deci-\nsion of the attorney general of the United States to authorize the Watergate burglary. There, an aggressive subordinate made some\n\nextreme proposal for advancing Republican interests through the use of some combination of whores and a gigantic yacht. When\n\f"}, "004060.png": {"text": "this ridiculous request was rejected, the subordinate backed off, in gracious concession, to merely asking for consent to a burglary,\nand the attorney general went along. Cialdini believes that subconscious reciprocation tendency thus became one important cause\nof the resignation of a United States president in the Watergate debacle, and so do I. Reciprocation tendency subtly causes many\nextreme and dangerous consequences, not just on rare occasions but pretty much all the time.\n\nMan\u2019s belief in reciprocate-favor tendency, following eons of his practicing it, has done some queer and bad things in religions.\nThe ritualized murder of the Phoenicians and the Aztecs, in which they sacrificed human victims to their gods, was a particularly\negregious example. And we should not forget that as late as the Punic Wars, the civilized Romans, out of fear of defeat, returned\nin a few instances to the practice of human sacrifice. On the other hand, the reciprocity-based, religion-boosting idea of obtaining\nhelp from God in reciprocation for good human behavior has probably been vastly constructive.\n\nOverall, both inside and outside religions, it seems clear to me that reciprocation tendency\u2019s constructive contributions to man\nfar outweigh its destructive effects. In cases of psychological tendencies being used to counter or prevent bad results from one or\nmore other psychological tendencies\u2014for instance, in the case of interventions to end chemical dependency\u2014you will usually\nfind reciprocation tendency performing strongly on the constructive side. And the very best part of human life probably lies in\nrelationships of affection wherein parties are more interested in pleasing than being pleased\u2014a not-uncommon outcome in dis-\nplay of reciprocate-favor tendency.\n\nBefore we leave reciprocate-favor tendency, the final phenomenon we will consider is widespread human misery from feelings\nof guilt. To the extent the feeling of guilt has an evolutionary base, I believe the most plausible cause is the mental conflict trig-\ngered in one direction by reciprocation tendency and in the opposite direction by reward-superresponse tendency pushing one to\n100 percent of some good thing.\n\nOf course, human culture has often greatly boosted the genetic tendency to suffer from feelings of guilt. Most especially, reli-\ngious culture has imposed hard-to-follow ethical and devotional demands on people. There is a charming Irish Catholic priest in\n\nmy neighborhood who, with rough accuracy, often says, \u201cThe old Jews may have invented guilt, but we Catholics perfected it.\u201d And\n\f"}, "004061.png": {"text": "if you, like me and this priest, believe that, averaged out, feelings of guilt do more good than harm, you may join in my special grat-\n\nitude for reciprocate-favor tendency, no matter how unpleasant you find feelings of guilt.\n\nTEN\n\nInfluence-from-mere-association tendency\n\nIn the standard conditioned reflexes studied by Skinner and most common in the world, responsive behavior, creating a new habit,\nis directly triggered by rewards previously bestowed. For instance, aman buys a can of branded shoe polish, has a good experience\nwith it when shining his shoes, and because of this \u201creward\u201d buys the same shoe polish when he needs another can.\n\nBut there is another type of conditioned reflex wherein mere association triggers a response. For instance, consider the case of\nmany men who have been trained by their previous experience in life to believe that when several similar items are presented for\npurchase, the one with the highest price will have the highest quality. Knowing this, some seller of an ordinary industrial product\nwill often change his product\u2019s trade dress and raise its price significantly, hoping that quality-seeking buyers will be tricked into\nbecoming purchasers by mere association of his product and its high price.\n\nThis industrial practice frequently is effective in driving up sales, and even more so in driving up profits. For instance, it worked\nwonderfully with high-priced power tools for a long time, and it would work better yet with high-priced pumps at the bottom of\noil wells. With luxury goods, the process works with a special boost because buyers who pay high prices often gain extra status\nfrom thus demonstrating both their good taste and their ability to pay.\n\nEven association that appears to be trivial, if carefully planned, can have extreme and peculiar effects on purchasers of prod-\nucts. The target purchaser of shoe polish may like pretty girls, so he chooses the polish with the pretty girl on the can or the one\nwith the pretty girl in the last ad for shoe polish that he saw.\n\f"}, "004062.png": {"text": "Advertisers know about the power of mere association. You won't see Coke advertised alongside some account of the death of\nachild. Instead, Coke ads picture life as happier than reality. Similarly, it is not from mere chance that military bands play such\nimpressive music. That kind of music, appearing in mere association with military service, helps to attract soldiers and keep them\nin the army. Most armies have learned to use mere association in this successful way.\n\nHowever, the most damaging miscalculations from mere association do not ordinarily come from advertisers and music\nproviders. Some of the most important miscalculations come from what is accidentally associated with one\u2019s past success, or one\u2019s\nliking and loving, or one\u2019s disliking and hating, which includes a natural hatred for bad news.\n\nTo avoid being misled by the mere association of some fact with past success, use this memory clue. Think of Napoleon and\nHitler when they invaded Russia after using their armies with much success elsewhere. And there are plenty of mundane ex-\namples of results like those of Napoleon and Hitler. For instance, a man foolishly gambles in a casino and yet wins. This unlikely\ncorrelation causes him to try the casino again, or again and again, to his horrid detriment. Or a man gets lucky in an odds-against\nventure headed by an untalented friend. So influenced, he tries again what worked before\u2014with terrible results.\n\nThe proper antidotes to being made such a patsy by past success are 1) to carefully examine each past success, looking for\naccidental, non-causative factors associated with such success that will tend to mislead as one appraises the odds implicit ina\nproposed new undertaking; and 2) to look for dangerous aspects of the new undertaking that were not present when past success\noccurred.\n\nThe damage to the mind that can come from liking and loving was once demonstrated by obviously false testimony given by an\notherwise very admirable woman, the wife of a party in a jury case. The famous opposing counsel wanted to minimize his attack\non such an admirable woman yet destroy the credibility of her testimony. And so, in his closing argument, he came to her testi-\n\nmony last. He then shook his head sadly and said, \u201cWhat are we to make of such testimony? The answer lies in the old rhyme:\n\n\u2018As the husband is,\n\nSo the wife is.\n\f"}, "004063.png": {"text": "She is married to a clown,\nAnd the grossness of his nature\n\nDrags her down.\n\nThe jury disbelieved the woman\u2019s testimony. They easily recognized the strong misinfluence of love on her cognition. And we\nnow often see even stronger misinfluence from love as tearful mothers, with heartfelt conviction, declare before TV cameras the\ninnocence of their obviously guilty sons.\n\nPeople disagree about how much blindness should accompany the association called love. In Poor Richard\u2019s Almanack, Franklin\ncounseled, \u201cKeep your eyes wide open before marriage and half shut thereafter.\u201d Perhaps this eyes-half-shut solution is about\nright, but I favor a tougher prescription: \u201cSee it like it is and love anyway.\u201d\n\nHating and disliking also cause miscalculation triggered by mere association. In business, I commonly see people under-\nappraise both the competency and morals of competitors they dislike. This is a dangerous practice, usually disguised because it oc-\ncurs on a subconscious basis.\n\nAnother common bad effect from the mere association of a person and a hated outcome is displayed in Persian messenger syn-\ndrome. Ancient Persians actually killed some messengers whose sole fault was that they brought home truthful bad news, say, of a\nbattle lost. It was actually safer for the messenger to run away and hide instead of doing his job as a wiser boss would have wanted\nit done.\n\nPersian messenger syndrome is alive and well in modern life, albeit in less lethal versions. It is actually dangerous in many\ncareers to be a carrier of unwelcome news. Union negotiators and employer representatives often know this, and it leads to many\ntragedies in labor relations. Sometimes lawyers, knowing their clients will hate them if they recommend an unwelcome but wise\nsettlement, will carry on to disaster.\n\nEven in places well known for high cognition, one will sometimes find Persian messenger syndrome. For instance, years ago,\n\ntwo major oil companies litigated in a Texas trial court over some ambiguity in an operating agreement covering one of the largest\n\f"}, "004064.png": {"text": "oil reservoirs in the Western hemisphere. My guess is that the cause of the trial was some general counsel\u2019s unwillingness to carry\nbad news to a strong-minded CEO.\n\nCBS, in its late heyday, was famous for the occurrence of Persian messenger syndrome because chairman Paley was hostile to\npeople who brought him bad news. The result was that Paley lived in a cocoon of unreality from which he made one bad deal after\nanother, even exchanging a large share of CBS for a company that had to be liquidated shortly thereafter.\n\nThe proper antidote to creating Persian messenger syndrome and its bad effects, like those at CBS, is to develop, through exer-\ncise of will, a habit of welcoming bad news. At Berkshire, there is a common injunction: \u201cAlways tell us the bad news promptly. It\nis only the good news that can wait.\u201d It also helps to be so wise and informed that people fear not telling you bad news because you\nare so likely to get it elsewhere.\n\nInfluence-from-mere-association tendency often has a shocking effect that helps swamp the normal tendency to return favor\nfor favor. Sometimes, when one receives a favor, his condition is unpleasant, due to poverty, sickness, subjugation, or something\nelse. In addition, the favor may trigger an envy-driven dislike for the person who was in so favorable a state that he could easily be\na favor giver. Under such circumstances, the favor receiver, prompted partly by mere association of the favor giver with past pain,\nwill not only dislike the man who helped him but also try to injure him. This accounts for a famous response, sometimes dubi-\nously attributed to Henry Ford: \u201cWhy does that man hate me so? I never did anything for him.\u201d\n\nThave a friend, whom I will now call Glotz, who had an amusing experience in favor-giving. Glotz owned an apartment building\nthat he had bought because he wanted, eventually, to use the land in a different development. Pending this outcome, Glotz was\nvery lenient in collecting below-market rents from tenants. When, at last, there was a public hearing on Glotz\u2019s proposal to tear\ndown the building, one tenant who was far behind in his rent payments was particularly angry and hostile. He came to the public\nhearing and said, \u201cThis proposal is outrageous. Glotz doesn\u2019t need any more money. I know this because I was supported in college\nby Glotz fellowships.\u201d\n\nA final serious clump of bad thinking caused by mere association lies in the common use of classification stereotypes. Because\n\nPete knows that Joe is 90 years old and that most 90-year-old persons don\u2019t think very well, Pete appraises old Joe as a thinking\n\f"}, "004065.png": {"text": "klutz even if old Joe still thinks very well. Or, because Jane is a white-haired woman and Pete knows no old women good at higher\nmath, Pete appraises Jane as no good at it even if Jane is a whiz.\n\nThis sort of wrong thinking is both natural and common. Pete\u2019s antidote is not to believe that, on average, 90-year-olds think\nas well as 40-year-olds, or that there are as many females as males among PhDs in math. Instead, just as he must learn that trend\ndoes not always correctly predict destiny, he must learn that the average dimension in some group will not reliably guide him to\nthe dimension of some specific item. Otherwise, Pete will make many errors, like that of the fellow who drowned in a river that av-\n\neraged out to only 18 inches deep.\n\nELEVEN\n\nSimple, pain-avoiding psychological denial\n\nThis phenomenon first hit me hard in World War II when the super-athlete, super-student son of a family friend flew off over the\nAtlantic Ocean and never came back. His mother, who was a very sane woman, then refused to believe he was dead. That\u2019s simple,\npain-avoiding psychological denial. The reality is too painful to bear, so one distorts the facts until they become bearable. We all\ndo that to some extent, often causing terrible problems. The tendency\u2019s most extreme outcomes are usually mixed up with love,\ndeath, and chemical dependency.\n\nWhere denial is used to make dying easier, the conduct meets almost no criticism. Who would begrudge a fellow man such help\nat such a time? But some people hope to leave life hewing to the iron prescription \u201cIt is not necessary to hope in order to persevere.\u201d\nAnd there is something admirable in anyone able to do this.\n\nIn chemical dependency, wherein morals usually break down horribly, addicted persons tend to believe that they remain in re-\nspectable condition, with respectable prospects. They thus display an extremely unrealistic denial of reality as they go deeper and\n\ndeeper into deterioration. In my youth, Freudian remedies failed utterly in reversing chemical dependency, but nowadays Alco-\n\f"}, "004066.png": {"text": "holics Anonymous routinely achieves a 50 percent cure rate by causing several psychological tendencies to act together to counter\naddiction. However, the cure process is typically difficult and draining, and a 50 percent success rate implies a 50 percent failure\nrate. One should stay far away from any conduct at all likely to drift into chemical dependency. Even a small chance of suffering so\n\ngreat a damage should be avoided.\n\nTWELVE\n\nExcessive self-regard tendency\n\nWe all commonly observe the excessive self-regard of man. He mostly misappraises himself on the high side, like the 90 percent of\nSwedish drivers who judge themselves to be above average. Such misappraisals also apply to a person's major \u201cpossessions.\u201d One\nspouse usually over-appraises the other spouse. And a man\u2019s children are likewise appraised higher by him than they are likely to\nbe in a more objective view.\n\nEven man\u2019s minor possessions tend to be over-appraised. Once owned, they suddenly become worth more to him than he\nwould pay if they were offered for sale to him and he didn\u2019t already own them. There is a name in psychology for this over-ap-\npraise-your-own-possessions phenomenon: the endowment effect. All man\u2019s decisions are suddenly regarded by him as better\nthan would have been the case just before he made them.\n\nMan\u2019s excess of self-regard typically makes him strongly prefer people like himself. Psychology professors have had much fun\ndemonstrating this effect in lost wallet experiments. Their experiments all show that the finder of a lost wallet containing identity\nclues will be most likely to return the wallet when the owner most closely resembles the finder. Given this quality in psychologi-\ncal nature, cliquish groups of similar persons will always be a very influential part of human culture, even after we wisely try to\n\ndampen the worst effects.\n\f"}, "004067.png": {"text": "Some of the worst consequences in modern life come when dysfunctional groups of cliquish persons, dominated by excessive\nself-regard tendency, select as new members of their organizations persons who are very much like themselves. Thus, if the\nEnglish department at an elite university becomes mentally dysfunctional, or the sales department of a brokerage firm slips into\nroutine fraud, the problem will have a natural tendency to get worse and be quite resistant to change for the better. So also with a\npolice department or prison guard unit or political group gone sour, and countless other places mired in evil and folly, such as the\nworst of our big-city teachers\u2019 unions that harm our children by preventing the discharge of ineffective teachers. Therefore, some\nof the most useful members of our civilization are those who are willing to clean house when they find a mess under their ambit of\ncontrol.\n\nWell, naturally, all forms of excess of self-regard cause much error. How could it be otherwise?\n\nLet us consider some foolish gambling decisions. In lotteries, the play is much lower when numbers are distributed randomly\nthan when the player picks his own number. This is quite irrational. The odds are almost exactly the same and much against the\nplayer. Because state lotteries take advantage of man\u2019s irrational love of self-picked numbers, modern man buys more lottery tick-\nets than he otherwise would have, with each purchase foolish.\n\nIntensify man\u2019s love of his own conclusions by adding the possessory wallop from the endowment effect and you will find that\naman who has already bought a pork-belly future on a commodity exchange now foolishly believes even more strongly than be-\nfore in the merits of his speculative bet. And foolish sports betting by people who love sports and think they know a lot about the\nrelative merits of teams is a lot more addictive than racetrack betting, partly because of man\u2019s automatic over-appraisal of his own\ncomplicated conclusions.\n\nAlso extremely counterproductive is man\u2019s tendency to bet, time after time, in games of skill, like golf or poker, against people\nwho are obviously much better players. Excessive self-regard tendency diminishes the foolish bettor\u2019s accuracy in appraising his\nrelative degree of talent.\n\nMore counterproductive yet are man\u2019s appraisals, typically excessive, of the quality of the future service he is to provide to his\n\nbusiness. His over-appraisal of these prospective contributions will frequently cause disaster.\n\f"}, "004068.png": {"text": "Excesses of self-regard often cause bad hiring decisions because employers grossly over-appraise the worth of their own\nconclusions that rely on impressions in face-to-face contact. The correct antidote to this sort of folly is to underweigh face-to-face\nimpressions and overweigh the applicant\u2019s past record.\n\nTonce chose exactly this course of action while I served as chairman of an academic search committee. I convinced fellow\ncommittee members to stop all further interviews and simply appoint a person whose achievement record was much better than\nthat of any other applicant. And when it was suggested to me that I wasn\u2019t giving \u201cacademic due process,\u201d I replied that I was the\none being true to academic values because I was using academic research showing the poor predictive value of impressions from\nface-to-face interviews.\n\nBecause man is likely to be overinfluenced by face-to-face impressions that, by definition, involve his active participation, a\njob candidate who is a marvelous presenter often causes great danger under modern executive search practice. In my opinion,\nHewlett-Packard faced just such a danger when it interviewed the articulate, dynamic Carly Fiorina in its search for a new CEO. I\nbelieve that 1) Hewlett-Packard made a bad decision when it chose Ms. Fiorina, and 2) this bad decision would not have been made\nif Hewlett-Packard had taken the methodological precautions it would have taken if it knew more psychology.\n\nThere is a famous passage somewhere in Tolstoy that illuminates the power of excessive self-regard tendency. According to\nTolstoy, the worst criminals don\u2019t appraise themselves as all that bad. They come to believe either that 1) they didn\u2019t commit their\ncrimes or 2) considering the pressures and disadvantages of their lives, it is understandable and forgivable that they behaved as\nthey did and became what they became.\n\nThe second half of the Tolstoy effect, wherein the man makes excuses for his fixable poor performance instead of providing the\nfix, is enormously important. Because a majority of mankind will try to get along by making way too many unreasonable excuses\nfor fixable poor performance, it is very important to have personal and institutional antidotes limiting the ravages of such folly.\n\nOn the personal level, a man should try to face the two simple facts: 1) Fixable but unfixed bad performance is bad character and\n\ntends to create more of itself, causing more damage to the excuse-giver with each tolerated instance; and 2) in demanding places,\n\f"}, "004069.png": {"text": "like athletic teams and General Electric, you are almost sure to be discarded in due course if you keep giving excuses instead of be-\nhaving as you should.\n\nThe main institutional antidotes to this part of the Tolstoy effect are 1) a fair, meritocratic, demanding culture, plus personnel\nhandling methods that build up morale; and 2) severance of the worst offenders.\n\nOf course, when you can\u2019t sever, as in the case of your own child, you must try to fix the child as best you can. I once heard of a\nchild teaching method so effective that the child remembered the learning experience over 50 years later. The child later became\ndean of the USC School of Music, and then related to me what his father said when he saw his child taking candy from the stock of\nhis employer with the excuse that he intended to replace it later. The father said, \u201cSon, it would be better for you to simply take all\nyou want and call yourself a thief every time you do it.\u201d\n\nThe best antidote to folly from an excess of self-regard is to force yourself to be more objective when you are thinking about\nyourself, your family and friends, your property, and the value of your past and future activity. This isn\u2019t easy to do well and won't\nwork perfectly, but it will work much better than simply letting psychological nature take its normal course.\n\nWhile an excess of self-regard is often counterproductive in its effects on cognition, it can cause some weird successes from\noverconfidence that happens to cause success. This factor accounts for the adage \u201cNever underestimate the man who overesti-\nmates himself.\u201d\n\nOf course, some high self-appraisals are correct and serve better than false modesty. Moreover, self-regard in the form of a\njustified pride in a job well done, or a life well lived, is a large constructive force. Without such justified pride, many more airplanes\nwould crash. \u201cPride\u201d is another word generally left out of psychology textbooks, and this omission is not a good idea. It is also not a\ngood idea to construe the Bible\u2019s parable about the Pharisee and the publican~ as condemning all pride.\n\nOf all forms of useful pride, perhaps the most desirable is a justified pride in being trustworthy. Moreover, the trustworthy man,\neven after allowing for the inconveniences of his chosen course, ordinarily has a life that averages out better than he would have if\n\nhe provided less reliability.\n\f"}, "004070.png": {"text": "THIRTEEN\n\nOveroptimism tendency\n\nAbout three centuries before the birth of Christ, Demosthenes, the most famous Greek orator, said, \u201cWhat a man wishes, that also\nwill he believe.\u201d\n\nDemosthenes, parsed out, was thus saying that man displays not only simple, pain-avoiding psychological denial but also an\nexcess of optimism, even when he is already doing well.\n\nThe Greek orator was clearly right about an excess of optimism being the normal human condition, even when pain or the\nthreat of pain is absent.

He had an automatic deprival-superreaction tendency in his\nnature.\n\nHumans are much the same as this Munger dog. A man ordinarily reacts with irrational intensity to even a small loss, or threat-\nened loss, of property, love, friendship, dominated territory, opportunity, status, or any other valued thing. As a natural result,\nbureaucratic infighting over the threatened loss of dominated territory often causes immense damage to an institution as a whole.\nThis factor, among others, accounts for much of the wisdom of Jack Welch\u2019s long fight against bureaucratic ills at General Electric.\nFew business leaders have ever conducted wiser campaigns.\n\nDeprival-superreaction tendency often protects ideological or religious views by triggering dislike and hatred directed toward\nvocal nonbelievers. This happens in part because the ideas of the nonbelievers, if they spread, will diminish the influence of views\nthat are now supported by a comfortable environment, including a strong belief-maintenance system. University liberal arts\ndepartments, law schools, and business organizations all display plenty of such ideology-based groupthink that rejects almost all\nconflicting inputs. When the vocal critic is a former believer, hostility is often boosted both by 1) a concept of betrayal that triggers\nadditional deprival-superreaction tendency because a colleague is lost, and 2) fears that conflicting views will have extra persua-\n\nsive power when they come from a former colleague.\n\f"}, "004072.png": {"text": "The foregoing considerations help account for the old idea of heresy, which for centuries justified much killing of heretics, fre-\nquently after torture and frequently accomplished by burning the victim alive. It is almost everywhere the case that extremes of\nideology are maintained with great intensity and with great antipathy to nonbelievers, causing extremes of cognitive dysfunction.\nThis happens, I believe, because two psychological tendencies are usually acting concurrently toward this same sad result: 1) in-\nconsistency-avoidance tendency, plus 2) deprival-superreaction tendency.\n\nOne antidote to intense, deliberate maintenance of groupthink is an extreme culture of courtesy, kept in place despite ideolog-\nical differences, like the behavior of the justices now serving on the US Supreme Court. Another antidote is to deliberately bring in\nable and articulate disbelievers of incumbent groupthink. Successful corrective measures to evil examples of groupthink mainte-\nnance have included actions like that of Derek Bok when, as president of Harvard, he started disapproving tenure appointments\nproposed by ideologues at Harvard Law School.\n\nEven a 1-degree loss from a 180-degree view will sometimes create enough deprival-superreaction tendency to turn a neighbor\ninto an enemy, as I once observed when I bought a house from one of two neighbors locked into hatred by a tiny tree newly in-\nstalled by one of them. As the case of these two neighbors illustrated, the clamor of almost any group of neighbors displaying\nirrational, extreme deprival-superreaction over some trifle in a zoning hearing is not a pretty thing to watch. Such bad behavior\ndrives some people from the zoning field. I once bought some golf clubs from an artisan who was formerly a lawyer. When I asked\nhim what kind of law he had practiced, I expected to hear him say divorce law. But his answer was zoning law.\n\nDeprival-superreaction tendency has ghastly effects in labor relations. Most of the deaths in the labor strife that occurred before\nWorld War I came when employers tried to reduce wages. Nowadays we see fewer deaths and more occasions when whole compa-\nnies disappear, as competition requires either takeaways from labor\u2014which it will not consent to\u2014or the death of the business.\nDeprival-superreaction tendency causes much of this labor resistance, often in cases where it would be in labor\u2019s interest to make\na different decision.\n\nIn contexts other than labor relations, takeaways are also difficult to get. Many tragedies therefore occur that would have been\n\navoided had there been more rationality and less subconscious heed of the imperative from deprival-superreaction tendency.\n\f"}, "004073.png": {"text": "Deprival-superreaction tendency is also a huge contributor to ruin from the compulsion to gamble. First, it causes the gambler\nto have a passion to get even once he has suffered a loss, and the passion grows with the loss. Second, the most addictive forms of\ngambling provide a lot of near misses, and each one triggers deprival-superreaction tendency. Some slot machine creators are vi-\ncious in exploiting this weakness of man. Electronic machines enable these creators to produce a lot of meaningless bar-bar-lemon\nresults that greatly increase play by fools who think they have very nearly won large rewards.\n\nDeprival-superreaction tendency often does much damage to man in open-outcry auctions. The social proof that we will next\nconsider tends to convince man that the last price from another bidder was reasonable, and then deprival-superreaction tendency\nprompts him strongly to top the last bid. The best antidote to being thus triggered into paying foolish prices at open-outcry auc-\ntions is the simple Buffett practice: Don\u2019t go to such auctions.\n\nDeprival-superreaction tendency and inconsistency-avoidance tendency often join to cause one form of business failure. In this\nform of ruin, a man gradually uses up all his good assets in a fruitless attempt to rescue a big venture going bad. One of the best\nantidotes to this folly is good poker skill learned young. The teaching value of poker demonstrates that not all effective teaching\noccurs on a standard academic path.\n\nI, myself, the would-be instructor here, many decades ago made a big mistake caused in part by the subconscious operation of\nmy deprival-superreaction tendency. A friendly broker called and offered me 300 shares of ridiculously underpriced, very thinly\ntraded Belridge Oil at $115 per share, which I purchased using cash I had on hand. The next day, he offered me 1,500 more shares\nat the same price, which I declined to buy, partly because I could only have made the purchase had I sold something or borrowed\nthe required $173,000.\n\nThis was a very irrational decision. I was a well-to-do man with no debt; there was no risk of loss, and similar no-risk oppor-\ntunities were not likely to come along. Within two years, Belridge Oil sold out to Shell at a price of about $3,700 per share, which\nmade me about $5.4 million poorer than I would have been had I then been psychologically acute.

However, I believe that I haven't defined the tendency as broadly as I should.\n\nMy reason for suggesting an even broader definition is that many Berkshire Hathaway shareholders I know never sell or give\naway a single share after immense gains in market value have occurred. Some of this reaction is caused by rational calculation, and\nsome is no doubt attributable to some combination of 1) reward superresponse, 2) status quo bias from inconsistency-avoidance\ntendency, and 3) the endowment effect from excessive self-regard tendency. But I believe the single strongest irrational explana-\ntion is a form of deprival-superreaction tendency. Many of these shareholders simply can\u2019t stand the idea of having their Berkshire\nHathaway holdings smaller. Partly they dislike facing what they consider an impairment of identity, but mostly they fear missing\n\nout on future gains from stock sold or given away.\n\nFIFTEEN\n\nSocial-proof tendency\n\nThe otherwise complex behavior of man is much simplified when he automatically thinks and does what he observes to be\nthought and done around him. Such followership often works fine. For instance, what simpler way could there be to find out how\nto walk to a big football game in a strange city than by following the flow of the crowd? For some such reason, man\u2019s evolution left\nhim with social-proof tendency, an automatic tendency to think and act as he sees others around him thinking and acting.\nPsychology professors love social-proof tendency because in their experiments it causes ridiculous results. For instance, if a\nprofessor arranges for some stranger to enter an elevator wherein 10 compliance practitioners are all silently standing so that they\nface the rear of the elevator, the stranger will often turn around and do the same. The psychology professors can also use social-\n\nproof tendency to cause people to make large and ridiculous measurement errors.\n\f"}, "004075.png": {"text": "And, of course, teenagers\u2019 parents usually learn more than they would like about teenagers\u2019 cognitive errors from social-proof\ntendency. This phenomenon was recently involved in a breakthrough by Judith Rich Harris, who demonstrated that super-re-\nspect by young people for their peers, rather than for parents or other adults, is ordained to some considerable extent by the genes\nof the young people. This makes it wise for parents to rely more on manipulating the quality of the peers than on exhortations to\ntheir own offspring. A person like Ms. Harris who can provide an insight of this quality and utility backed by new reasons has not\nlived in vain.\n\nIn the highest reaches of business, it is not uncommon to find leaders who display followership akin to that of teenagers. If one\noil company foolishly buys a mine, other oil companies often quickly join in buying mines. So too if the purchased company makes\nfertilizer. Both of these oil-company buying fads actually bloomed, with bad results.\n\nOf course, it is difficult to identify and correctly weigh all the possible ways to deploy the cash flow of an oil company. So oil\ncompany executives, like everyone else, have made many bad decisions that were quickly triggered by discomfort from doubt.\nGoing along with social proof provided by the action of other oil companies ends this discomfort in a natural way.\n\nWhen will social-proof tendency be most easily triggered? Here, the answer is clear from many experiments: Triggering most\nreadily occurs in the presence of puzzlement or stress, and particularly when both exist.\n\nBecause stress intensifies social-proof tendency, disreputable sales organizations\u2014engaged, for instance, in such action as sell-\ning swampland to schoolteachers\u2014manipulate targets into situations combining isolation and stress. The isolation strengthens\nthe social proof provided by both the knaves and the people who buy first, and the stress, often increased by fatigue, augments the\ntargets\u2019 susceptibility to the social proof. And, of course, the techniques of our worst \u201creligious\u201d cults imitate those of the knavish\nsalesmen. One cult even used rattlesnakes to heighten the stress felt by conversion targets.\n\nBecause both bad and good behavior are made contagious by social-proof tendency, it is highly important that human societies\n1) stop any bad behavior before it spreads and 2) foster and display all good behavior.\n\nMy father once told me that just after commencing law practice in Omaha, he went with a large group from Nebraska to South\n\nDakota to hunt pheasants.

And therefore we often get Serpico syndrome, named to commem-\norate the state of a near-totally corrupt New York police division joined by Frank Serpico. He was then nearly murdered by gunfire\nbecause of his resistance to going along with the corruption in the division. Such corruption was being driven by social proof plus\nincentives, the combination that creates Serpico syndrome. The Serpico story should be taught more than it is because the didactic\npower of its horror is aimed at a very important evil, driven substantially by a very important force: social proof.\n\nIn social proof, it is not only action by others that misleads but also their inaction. In the presence of doubt, inaction by others\nbecomes social proof that inaction is the right course. Thus, the inaction of a great many bystanders led to the death of Kitty Gen-\novese in a famous incident much discussed in introductory psychology courses.\n\nIn the ambit of social proof, the outside directors on a corporate board usually display the near ultimate form of inaction. They\nfail to object to anything much short of an axe murder until some public embarrassment of the board finally causes their interven-\ntion. A typical board of directors culture was once well described by my friend Joe Rosenfield as he said, \u201cThey asked me if I wanted\nto become a director of Northwest Bell, and it was the last thing they ever asked me.\u201d\n\nIn advertising and sales promotion, social-proof tendency is about as strong a factor as one could imagine. \u201cMonkey see, mon-\nkey do\u201d is the old phrase that reminds one of how strongly John will often wish to do something or have something just because\nJoe does or has it. One interesting consequence is that an advertiser will pay a lot to have its soup can instead of someone else\u2019s ina\nmovie scene involving soup consumption only in a peripheral way.\n\nSocial-proof tendency often interacts in a perverse way with envy/jealousy and deprival-superreaction tendency.

And everyone who has taken Psych 101 knows that stress makes social-proof tendency more\npowerful. In a phenomenon less well recognized but still widely known, light stress can slightly improve performance\u2014say, in ex-\naminations\u2014whereas heavy stress causes dysfunction.\n\nBut few people know more about really heavy stress than that it can cause depression. For instance, most people know that an\n\u201cacute stress depression\u201d makes thinking dysfunctional because it causes an extreme of pessimism, often extended in length and\nusually accompanied by activity-stopping fatigue. Fortunately, as most people also know, such a depression is one of mankind\u2019s\nmore reversible ailments. Even before modern drugs were available, many people afflicted by depression, such as Winston\nChurchill and Samuel Johnson, gained great achievement in life.\n\nMost people know very little about non-depressive mental breakdowns influenced by heavy stress. But there is at least one\nexception, involving the work of Pavlov when he was in his 70s and 80s. Pavlov had won a Nobel Prize early in life by using dogs to\nwork out the physiology of digestion. Then he became world-famous by working out mere-association responses in dogs, initially\nsalivating dogs\u2014so much so that changes in behavior triggered by mere association, like those caused by much modern advertise-\nment, are today often said to come from \u201cPavlovian\u201d conditioning.\n\nWhat happened to cause Pavlov\u2019s last work was especially interesting. During the great Leningrad flood of the 1920s, Pavlov\nhad many dogs in cages. Their habits had been transformed, by a combination of his Pavlovian conditioning plus standard reward\nresponses, into distinct and different patterns. As the waters of the flood came up and receded, many dogs reached a point where\n\nthey had almost no airspace between their noses and the tops of their cages. This subjected them to maximum stress.

The unanticipated, extreme changes in Pavlov\u2019s dogs would have driven any good experi-\nmental scientist into a near-frenzy of curiosity. That was indeed Pavlov\u2019s reaction. But not many scientists would have done what\nPavlov next did\u2014which was to spend the rest of his long life giving stress-induced nervous breakdowns to dogs, after which he\nwould try to reverse the breakdowns, all the while keeping careful experimental records.\n\nHe found that 1) he could classify dogs so as to predict how easily a particular dog would break down, 2) the dogs hardest to\nbreak down were also the hardest to return to their pre-breakdown state, 3) any dog could be broken down, and 4) he couldn't re-\nverse a breakdown except by reimposing stress.\n\nNow, practically everyone is revolted by such experimental treatment of man\u2019s friend, the dog. Moreover, Pavlov was Russian\nand did his last work under the Communists. Maybe those facts account for the present extreme widespread ignorance of Pavlov\u2019s\nlast work. The two Freudian psychiatrists with whom I tried many years ago to discuss this work had never heard of it. And the\ndean of a major medical school actually asked me, several years ago, if any of Pavlov\u2019s experiments were \u201crepeatable\u201d in the experi-\nments of other researchers. Obviously, Pavlov is now a sort of forgotten hero in medical science.\n\nI first found a description of Pavlov\u2019s last work in a popular paperback, written by some Rockefeller-financed psychiatrist, when\nI was trying to figure out 1) how cults worked their horrible mischief and 2) what the law should say about what parents could do\nto \u201cdeprogram\u201d children who had become brainwashed zombies. Naturally, mainstream law objected to the zombies being physi-\ncally captured by their parents and next subjected to stress that would help to deprogram the effects of the stress they had endured\nin cult conversions.\n\nInever wanted to get into the legal controversy that existed about this subject. But I did conclude that the controversy couldn\u2019t\nbe handled with maximized rationality without considering whether, as Pavlov\u2019s last work suggests, the heavy-handed imposition\n\nof stress might be the only reversal method that would work to remedy one of the worst evils imaginable: a stolen mind.

So the mind overweighs what is easily available and thus displays avail-\nability-misweighing tendency.\n\nThe main antidote to miscues from availability-misweighing tendency often involve procedures, including the use of check-\nlists, which are almost always helpful. Another antidote is to behave somewhat like Darwin did when he emphasized disconfirm-\ning evidence: What should be done is to especially emphasize factors that don\u2019t produce reams of easily available numbers instead\nof drifting mostly or entirely into considering factors that do produce such numbers. Still another antidote is to find and hire some\nskeptical, articulate people with far-reaching minds to act as advocates for notions that are opposite to the incumbent notions.\n\nOne consequence of this tendency is that extra-vivid evidence, being so memorable and thus more available in cognition,\nshould often consciously be underweighed, while less vivid evidence should be overweighed. Still, the special strength of extra-\nvivid images in influencing the mind can be constructively used 1) in persuading someone else to reach a correct conclusion or\n2) as a device for improving one\u2019s own memory by attaching vivid images, one after the other, to many items one doesn\u2019t want to\nforget.

His learning capacity will also shrink as he creates gaps in the lat-\nticework of theory he needs as a framework for understanding new experience. It is also essential for a thinking man to assemble\nhis skills into a checklist that he routinely uses. Any other mode of operation will cause him to miss much that is important.\n\nSkills of a very high order can be maintained only with daily practice. The pianist [Ignacy Jan] Paderewski once said that if he\nfailed to practice for a single day, he could notice his performance deterioration, and that after a week\u2019s gap in practice, the audi-\nence could notice it as well.\n\nThe hard rule of use-it-or-lose-it tendency tempers its harshness for the diligent. If a skill is raised to fluency, instead of merely\nbeing crammed in briefly to enable one to pass some test, then the skill 1) will be lost more slowly and 2) will come back faster\nwhen refreshed with new learning.

This example shows how powerful is the tendency to go along with an authority figure and how it can\nturn one\u2019s brain into mush.\n\nMy final example comes from business. A psychology PhD once became a CEO of a major company and went wild, creating an\nexpensive new headquarters, with a great wine cellar, at an isolated site. At some point, his underlings remonstrated that money\nwas running short. \u201cTake the money out of the depreciation reserves,\u201d said the CEO. Not too easy, because a depreciation reserve is\na liability account. So strong is undue respect for authority that this CEO, and many even worse examples, have actually been al-\nlowed to remain in control of important business institutions for long periods after it was clear they should be removed.\n\nThe obvious implication: Be careful whom you appoint to power, because a dominant authority figure will often be hard to re-\n\nmove, aided as he will be by authority-misinfluence tendency.\n\nTWENTY-THREE\n\nTwaddle tendency\n\nMan, asa social animal who has the gift of language, is born to prattle and pour out twaddle that does much damage when serious\nwork is being attempted. Some people produce copious amounts of twaddle, and others very little.\n\nTrouble from the honeybee version of twaddle was once demonstrated in an interesting experiment. A honeybee normally goes\nout and finds nectar and then comes back and does a dance that communicates to the other bees where the nectar is. The other\nbees then go out and get it. Well, some scientist\u2014clever, like B. F. Skinner\u2014decided to see how well a honeybee would do witha\nhandicap. He put the nectar straight up. Way up. Well, in a natural setting, there is no nectar a long way straight up, and the poor\nhoneybee doesn\u2019t have a genetic program that is adequate to handle what she now has to communicate. You might guess that this\nhoneybee would come back to the hive and slink into a corner, but she doesn\u2019t. She comes into the hive and does an incoherent\n\ndance.\n\f"}, "004087.png": {"text": "Well, all my life I\u2019ve been dealing with the human equivalent of that honeybee. It\u2019s a very important part of wise administration\nto keep prattling people pouring out twaddle far away from the serious work.\n\nArightly famous Caltech engineering professor, exhibiting more insight than tact, once expressed his version of this idea as\nfollows: \u201cThe principal job of an academic administration is to keep the people who don\u2019t matter from interfering with the work of\nthe people who do.\u201d\n\nlinclude this quotation partly because I long suffered from backlash caused by my version of this professor\u2019s conversational\nmanner.

This accounts\nfor the widespread popularity of crossword puzzles, other puzzles, and bridge and chess columns, as well as all games requiring\nmental skill.\n\nThis tendency has an obvious implication. It makes man especially prone to learn well when a would-be teacher gives correct\nreasons for what is taught instead of simply laying out the desired belief ex cathedra with no reasons given. Few practices, there-\nfore, are wiser than not only thinking through reasons before giving orders but also communicating these reasons to the recipient\nof the order.\n\nNo one knew this better than Carl Braun, who designed oil refineries with spectacular skill and integrity. He had a very simple\n\nrule, one of many in his large, Teutonic company: You had to tell who was to do what, where, when, and why. And if you wrote acom-\n\f"}, "004088.png": {"text": "munication leaving out your explanation of why the addressee was to do what was ordered, Braun was likely to fire you, because\nBraun well knew that ideas got through best when the reasons for the ideas were meticulously laid out.\n\nIn general, learning is most easily assimilated and used when, lifelong, people consistently hang their experience, actual and\nvicarious, on a latticework of theory answering the question \u201cWhy?\u201d Indeed, the question \u201cWhy?\u201d is a sort of Rosetta stone open-\ning up the major potentiality of mental life.\n\nUnfortunately, reason-respecting tendency is so strong that even a person\u2019s giving of meaningless or incorrect reasons will\nincrease compliance with his orders and requests. This has been demonstrated in psychology experiments wherein compliance\npractitioners successfully jump to the head of the lines in front of copying machines by explaining their reason: \u201cI have to make\nsome copies.\u201d\n\nThis sort of unfortunate byproduct of reason-respecting tendency is a conditioned reflex based on a widespread appreciation\nof the importance of reasons. Naturally, the practice of laying out various claptrap reasons is much used by commercial and cult\n\ncompliance practitioners to help them get what they don\u2019t deserve.\n\nTWENTY-FIVE\nLollapalooza tendency\u2014the tendency to get extreme consequences from confluences of psychological ten-\n\ndencies acting in favor of a particular outcome\n\nThis tendency was not in any of the psychology texts I once examined, at least in any coherent fashion, yet it dominates life.

How could anyone who had\ntaken a freshman course in physics or chemistry not be driven to consider, above all, how psychological tendencies combine and\nwith what effects? Why would anyone think his study of psychology was adequate without his having endured the complexity\ninvolved in dealing with intertwined psychological tendencies? What could be more ironic than professors using oversimplified\nnotions while studying bad cognitive effects grounded in the mind\u2019s tendency to use oversimplified algorithms?\n\nI will make a few tentative suggestions. Maybe many of the long-dead professors wanted to create a whole science from one\nnarrow type of repeatable psychology experiment that was conductible in a university setting and that aimed at one psychological\ntendency at a time. If so, these early psychology professors made a massive error in so restricting their approach to their subject. It\nwould be like physics ignoring 1) astrophysics, because it couldn\u2019t happen in a physics lab, plus 2) all compound effects.\n\nWhat psychological tendencies could account for early psychology professors adopting an over-restricted approach to their\nown subject matter? One candidate would be availability-misweighing tendency grounded in a preference for easy-to-control\ndata. And then the restrictions would eventually create an extreme case of man-with-a-hammer tendency. Another candidate\nmight be envy/jealousy tendency, through which early psychology professors displayed some weird form of envy of a physics that\nwas misunderstood. This possibility tends to demonstrate that leaving envy/jealousy out of academic psychology was never a\ngood idea.\n\nInow quitclaim all these historical mysteries to my betters.\n\nWell, that ends my brief description of psychological tendencies.\n\f"}, "004090.png": {"text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n\nNow, as promised, I will ask and answer a few general questions.\n\nMy first is acompound question: Isn\u2019t this list of psychological tendencies tautological to some extent compared to the system\nof Euclid? That is, aren\u2019t there overlaps in the tendencies? And couldn\u2019t the system be laid out just as plausibly in a somewhat\ndifferent way? The answers are yes, yes, and yes, but this matters only moderately. Further refinement of these tendencies, while\ndesirable, has a limited practical potential because a significant amount of messiness is unfixable in a soft science like psychology.\n\nMy second question is: Can you supply a real-world model, instead of a Milgram-type controlled psychology experiment, that\nuses your system to illustrate multiple psychological tendencies interacting in a plausibly diagnosable way? The answer is yes. One\nof my favorite cases involves the McDonnell Douglas airliner evacuation test.\n\nBefore a new airliner can be sold, the government requires that it pass an evacuation test, during which a full load of passengers\nmust get out in some short period of time. The government directs that the test be realistic, so you can\u2019t pass by evacuating only\n20-year-old athletes. So McDonnell Douglas scheduled such a test in a darkened hangar using a lot of old people as evacuees. The\npassenger cabin was, say, 20 feet above the concrete floor of the hangar and was to be evacuated through moderately flimsy rub-\nber chutes. The first test was made in the morning. There were about 20 very serious injuries, and the evacuation took so long it\nflunked the time test. So what did McDonnell Douglas next do? It repeated the test in the afternoon, and this time there was an-\nother failure, with about 20 more serious injuries, including one case of permanent paralysis.\n\nWhat psychological tendencies contributed to this terrible result? Well, using my tendency list as a checklist, I come up with\nthe following explanation:\n\nReward-superresponse tendency drove McDonnell Douglas to act fast. It couldn\u2019t sell its airliner until it passed the test. Also\n\npushing the company was doubt-avoidance tendency, with its natural drive to arrive at a decision and run with it. Then the\n\f"}, "004091.png": {"text": "government's direction that the test be realistic drove authority-misinfluence tendency into the mischief of causing McDonnell\nDouglas to overreact by using what was obviously too dangerous a test method. By now the course of action had been decided, so\ninconsistency-avoidance tendency helped preserve the near-idiotic plan. When all the old people got to the dark hangar, with its\nhigh airline cabin and concrete floor, the situation must have made McDonnell Douglas employees very queasy, but they saw other\nemployees and supervisors not objecting. Social-proof tendency, therefore, swamped the queasiness. This allowed continued ac-\ntion as planned, a continuation that was aided by more authority-misinfluence tendency.\n\nThen came the disaster of the morning test with its failure, plus serious injuries. McDonnell Douglas ignored the strong discon-\nfirming evidence from the failure of the first test because confirmation bias, aided by the triggering of a strong deprival-superre-\naction tendency, favored maintaining the original plan. McDonnell Douglas\u2019s deprival-suppereaction tendency was now like that\nwhich causes a gambler, bent on getting even after a huge loss, to make his final big bet. After all, McDonnell Douglas was going to\nlose a lot if it didn\u2019t pass its test as scheduled.\n\nMore psychology-based explanation can probably be made, but the foregoing discussion is complete enough to demonstrate the\nutility of my system when used in a checklist mode.\n\nMy third question is also compound: In the practical world, what good is the thought system laid out in this list of tendencies?\nIsn't practical benefit prevented because these psychological tendencies are so thoroughly programmed into the human mind by\nbroad evolution\u2014the combination of genetic and cultural evolution\u2014that we can\u2019t get rid of them?\n\nWell, the answer is that the tendencies are probably much more good than bad. Otherwise, they wouldn't be there, working\npretty well for man, given his condition and his limited brain capacity. So the tendencies can\u2019t be simply washed out automatically,\nand shouldn't be. Nevertheless, the psychological thought system described, when properly understood and used, enables the\nspread of wisdom and good conduct and facilitates the avoidance of disaster. Tendency is not always destiny, and knowing the ten-\ndencies and their antidotes can often help prevent trouble that would otherwise occur.\n\nHere is a short list of examples reminding us of the great utility of elementary psychological knowledge:\n\f"}, "004092.png": {"text": ".

The rules of the US Constitutional Convention: totally secret meetings, no recorded vote by name until the final vote, votes\nreversible at any time before the end of the convention, then just one vote on the whole Constitution.

I said, \u201cThey\u2019re teaching 28-year-old people that high school algebra works in real life?\u201d But later, I wised up\nand realized that it was very important that they do that to counter some bad effects from psychological tendencies.

In social psychology, the more people learn about the system, the less it is true, and this is what\ngives the system its great value as a preventer of bad outcomes and a driver of good outcomes. This result is paradoxical and\ndoesn\u2019t remind one of elementary physics, but so what. One can\u2019t get all the paradox out of pure math, so why should psychology\nbe shocked by some paradox?\n\nThere is also some paradox in cognition change that works even when the manipulated person knows he is being manipulated.\nThis creates a sort of paradox in a paradox, but again, so what.\n\nTonce much enjoyed an occasion of this sort. I drew this beautiful woman as my dinner partner many years ago. I\u2019d never seen\nher before. She was married to a prominent Los Angeles man. She sat down next to me, turned her beautiful face up, and said,\n\u201cCharlie, what one word accounts for your remarkable success in life?\u201d I knew I was being manipulated by a practiced routine, and\nIjust loved it. Inever see this woman without a little lift in my spirits. And, by the way, I told her I was rational. You'll have to judge\nyourself whether that\u2019s true. I may be demonstrating some psychological tendency I hadn't planned on demonstrating.\n\nMy fifth question is: Don\u2019t we need more reconciliation of psychology and economics? My answer is yes, and I suspect that some\nslight progress is being made. I have heard of one such example: Colin Camerer of Caltech, who works in experimental economics,\ndevised an interesting experiment in which he caused high-IQ students, playing for real money, to pay price A + B for a \u201csecurity\u201d\nthey knew would turn into A dollars at the end of the day. This foolish action occurred because the students were allowed to trade\nwith each other in a liquid market for the security. Some students then paid price A + B because they hoped to unload on other stu-\ndents at a higher price before the day was over.\n\nWhat I will now confidently predict is that, despite Camerer\u2019s experimental outcome, most economics and corporate finance\nprofessors who still believe in the hard-form efficient-market hypothesis will retain their original belief. If so, this will be one more\nindication of how irrational smart people can be when influenced by psychological tendencies.\n\nMy sixth question is: Don\u2019t moral and prudential problems come with knowledge of these psychological tendencies? The an-\n\nswer is yes. For instance, psychological knowledge improves persuasive power, and, like other powers, it can be used for good or ill.\n\f"}, "004094.png": {"text": "Captain Cook once played a psychology-based trick on his seamen to cause them to eat sauerkraut and avoid scurvy. In my opinion,\nthis action was both ethical and wise under the circumstances, despite the deliberate manipulation involved.\n\nBut ordinarily, when you try to use your knowledge of psychological tendencies in the artful manipulation of someone whose\ntrust you need, you will be making both a moral and a prudential error. The moral error is obvious. The prudential error comes\nbecause many intelligent people, targeted for conscious manipulation, are likely to figure out what you are trying to do and resent\nyour action.\n\nMy final question is: Aren\u2019t there factual and reasoning errors in this talk? The answer is yes, almost surely yes.

I even hope that more psychology professors will join me in 1) making heavy use of inversion, 2) driving for a\ncomplete description of the psychological system so that it works better as a checklist, and 3) especially emphasizing effects from\ncombinations of psychological tendencies.\n\nWell, that ends my talk. If in considering what I have said you had 10 percent the fun I had in saying it, you were lucky recipi-\n\nents.\n\nTALK ELEVEN REVISITED\n\nIn this talk, made in 2000, I gave favorable mention to Judith Rich Harris's strong-selling book The Nurture Assumption. You will\nrecall that this work demonstrated that peer pressure on the young is far more important, and parental nurture much less impor-\n\ntant, than had been commonly recognized.\n\f"}, "004095.png": {"text": "The success of the book, with its vast practical implications, has an interesting story behind it. Long before the book was\npublished, Harris was kicked out of Harvard's PhD program in psychology because Harvard believed that she lacked qualities ideal\nin psychological research. Then later, out of illness and obscurity, as she was pretty much housebound throughout adult life by\nunfixable autoimmune disease, she published an academic paper on which her subsequent book was based. And for that paper she\nwon a prestigious medal, named after the man who signed her dismissal notice from Harvard, awarded annually by the American\nPsychological Association for distinction in published writing.\n\nWhen I learned from her impressive book that this ironic result had occurred, I wrote to Harvard, my alma mater, urging it to\naward Harris, whom I did not know, an honorary PhD\u2014or, better yet, a real PhD. I cited the example of Oxford. That great univer-\nsity once allowed its best student, Samuel Johnson, to leave without a degree because he was too poor to continue paying tuition.\nBut Oxford later made gracious amends. It gave Johnson a doctorate after he conquered sickness and became famous in a tough\nclimb once described in his own words: \u201cSlow rises worth, by poverty oppressed.\u201d\n\nI failed utterly in my effort to convince Harvard to imitate Oxford in this way. But Harvard did later recruit from MIT one of\nthe most famous living psychology professors, Steven Pinker, and Pinker is a big admirer of Harris. From this step, we can see one\nreason why its liberal arts division is more highly regarded than most others. The division\u2019s extreme depth often allows partial cor-\nrection of bonehead errors that would flourish unopposed elsewhere.\n\nIn 2006, Harris, struggling further through her unfixable illness, published another book, No Two Alike. The title is apt because\none central question the author assaults is why identical twins turn out to be so different in important aspects of personality. Her\ndogged curiosity and rigor in dealing with this question remind me of both Darwin and Sherlock Holmes. And her solution is very\nplausible, as she collects and explains data from professional literature, including an interesting case wherein one of two identical\ntwins became a success in business and family life while the other twin went to Skid Row.\n\nI won't here disclose Harris's desirably generalized answer to her central question, because it would be better for Almanack\nreaders to first guess the answer, then read her book. If Harris is roughly right, which seems very likely to me, she has twice, from\n\navery handicapped position, produced academic insights of great practical importance in child-rearing, education, and much else.\n\f"}, "004096.png": {"text": "How could this rare and desirable result happen? Well, by Harris\u2019s own account, she was \u201cimpertinent and skeptical, even as a\nchild,\u201d and these qualities, plus patient, determined skill, have obviously served her truth-seeking well, all the way through to age\n67. No doubt she was also assisted by her enthusiasm in destroying her own ideas, as she now demonstrates by apologizing for her\nformer work as a textbook writer who repeated wrong notions, now outgrown.\n\nIn this talk I displayed some impertinency of my own by delivering an extreme-sounding message. It claims nothing less than\nthat 1) academic psychology is hugely important; 2) even so, it is usually ill-thought-out and ill-presented by its PhD denizens;\nand 3) my way of presenting psychology often has a large superiority in practical utility compared to most textbooks. Naturally, I\nbelieve these extreme claims are correct. After all, I assembled the material contained in this talk to help me succeed in practical\nthinking and not to gain advantage by making public any would-be clever notions.\n\nIf 1 am even partly right, the world will eventually see more psychology in roughly the form of this talk.

In general, the energy in a gas mol-\necule is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy per molecule increases.\nAsa gas is heated, its molecules move more rapidly. This movement produces increased pressure if the gas is confined in a space of\n\nconstant volume, or increased volume if the pressure remains constant.\n\n73 N.

His wealth\nallowed him to retire young, and he secured a seat in Parliament. He became interested in economics after reading Adam Smith\u2019s\nThe Wealth of Nations and made many significant contributions to the field. Ricardo is often credited with the theory of compara-\ntive advantage, which explains why it can be beneficial for two countries to trade even though one of them may be able to produce\nevery kind of item more cheaply than the other. The concept was first described by Robert Torrens in 1815 in an essay on the\n\nwheat trade, but Ricardo explained it more clearly in his 1817 book The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation.\n\n80 Adam Smith recorded in An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) his observations at a pin factory.\nHe found that only 10 workers were able to produce 48,000 pins per day because of divided and specialized labor. If each worker\nhandled all the steps required to make a pin, he could only make 20 per day, for a total factory output of 200 pins daily. Smith\nrecognized and extolled the great productivity gains and economic progress represented by the pin factory and its embrace of spe-\n\ncialized labor.\n\n81 Ronald Coase (1910-2013), born ina suburb of London, graduated from secondary school at age 12 and enrolled in the Univer-\nsity of London only two years later. He earned degrees in law and economics and began research into transaction costs. He came to\nthe United States in 1951 for an academic career that started at the University of Buffalo.

However, the relative costs of producing those two goods are different in the two countries. In Eng-\nland it is very hard to produce wine, but only moderately difficult to produce cloth. In Portugal both are easy to produce. Therefore,\nwhile it is cheaper to produce cloth in Portugal than England, it is cheaper still for Portugal to produce excess wine and trade it for\nEnglish cloth. Conversely, England benefits from this trade because its cost for producing cloth has not changed but it can now\nget wine at closer to the cost of cloth.\u201d Frequently overlooked is that Ricardo\u2019s comparative advantage in delegating tasks among\nnations is equally applicable for managers delegating work. Even if a manager can perform the full range of tasks better himself, it\n\nis still mutually advantageous to divide them up.\n\n84 Fra Luca de Pacioli (1445-1517) in 1494 published his seminal work, The Collected Knowledge of Arithmetic, Geometry, Propor-\ntion, and Proportionality. In one section of the book, Pacioli described a novel concept, double-entry accounting. This invention\n\nrevolutionized business practice and made Pacioli a celebrity.

Mandeville\u2019s philosophy suggests that altruism harms the state and its intellectual\nprogress, and that self-interested human vice is the real engine of progress.

The\nfirst theorem holds that one can use the mathematical system to construct a statement that can be neither proved nor disproved\nwithin that system. The second theorem, arrived at by proving the first, states that no consistent system can be used to prove its\n\nown consistency.\n\n88 In 1978, nearly two-thirds of California voters passed Proposition 13, which limits property taxes to 1 percent of a property\u2019s\nmarket value and to 2 percent per year any increase in the property\u2019s valuation assessment unless the property is sold. Prior to\nProposition 13, there were no real limits on increases either for the tax rate or property value assessments in the state of California.\nProp 13 set the stage for a broader taxpayer revolt that contributed to Ronald Reagan\u2019s election as president in 1980. In the 2003\nCalifornia gubernatorial recall election in which Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected, Schwarzenegger adviser Warren Buffett sug-\ngested that Proposition 13, still very popular with many homeowners, be repealed or changed to help balance the state\u2019s budget.\n\nPolitically, Buffett\u2019s suggestion proved to be highly charged.\n\f"}, "004122.png": {"text": "Talk Ten: USC Gould School of Law Commencement Address\n\n89 In Confucian thought, filial piety\u2014a love and respect for one\u2019s parents and ancestors\u2014is a virtue to be cultivated.

Mozart\u2019s sickly wife, Constanze, required regular cures at spring baths used only by the\nwealthy.
