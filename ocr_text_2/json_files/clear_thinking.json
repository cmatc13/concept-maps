How can we get better at reason-\ning? Why do people make bad decisions? Why do some people consistently get better results than others who have the same infor-\nmation? How can I be right more often, and decrease the probability of a bad outcome when lives are on the line?\n\nUp until that point in my career, I\u2019d been fairly lucky, and while I wanted that luck to continue, I also wanted to depend on it\nless. If there was a method for clear thinking and good judgment\u2014I wanted to harness it.\n\nIf you're like me, no one ever taught you how to think or make decisions. There\u2019s no class called Clear Thinking 101 in school.\nEveryone seems to expect you to know how to do it already or to learn how on your own. As it turns out, though, learning about\nthinking\u2014thinking clearly\u2014is surprisingly hard.\n\nFor the next several years, I devoted myself to learning how to think better. I watched how people acquired information,\nreasoned, and acted in practice, and how their actions unfolded into positive or negative outcomes. Were some people just smarter\nthan others? Or did they have better systems or practices in place? In the moments that mattered, were people even aware of the\nquality of their thinking? How could I avoid the obvious errors?\n\nI followed the most senior people around to meetings. I\u2019d sit there quietly\u2122! listening to what they thought was important\nand why. I read anything I could on cognition and talked to anyone who would pick up the phone.\n\nIsought out the titans of industry\u00ae2 who seemed to consistently think clearly even when others couldn\u2019t. They seemed to\nknow something that was not commonly known, and I was determined to find out what.\n\nWhile the rest of us are chasing victory, the best in the world know they must avoid losing before they can win. It turns out\nthis is a surprisingly effective strategy.\n\nTo catalog my learning, I created an anonymous website called Farnam Street, found at fs.blog, named in honor of Charlie\nMunger and Warren Buffett,2 two people who exercise judgment for a living and who have had a profound impact on how I see\nthe world.=4\n\nT\u2019ve been fortunate over the years to talk to my heroes Charlie Munger and Daniel Kahneman about thinking and decision-\n\nmaking, along with other master practitioners like Bill Ackman, Annie Duke, Adam Robinson, Randall Stutman, and Kat Cole.\n\f"}, "000933.png": {"text": "Many of these conversations are public on The Knowledge Project podcast. Others, like my time spent with Munger, must remain\nprivate. Among all the people I\u2019ve spoken with, though, no one has influenced my thinking and ideas more than my friend Peter D.\nKaufman.\n\nThousands of conversations have yielded a key insight.\n\nIn order to get the results we desire, we must do two things. We must first create the space to reason in our thoughts, feelings,\nand actions; and second, we must deliberately use that space to think clearly. Once you have mastered this skill, you will find you\nhave an unstoppable advantage.\n\nDecisions made through clear thinking will put you in increasingly better positions, and success will only compound from\nthere.\n\nThis book is a practical guide to mastering clear thinking.\n\nThe first half of the book is about creating space for it. First, we identify the enemies of clear thinking. You will learn how most\nof what we consider to be \u201cthinking\u201d is in fact reacting without reasoning, prompted by biological instincts that evolved to pre-\nserve our species. When we react without reasoning, our position is weakened, and our options get increasingly worse. When we\nritualize a response to our biological triggers, we create the space to think clearly, and strengthen our position. Then, we identify a\nnumber of practical, actionable ways to both manage your weaknesses and build your strengths so that space is consistently cre-\nated when you're under pressure.\n\nThe second half of the book is about putting clear thinking into practice. Once you are in a place where you've shored up your\nstrengths and managed your weaknesses\u2014when you've created the pause between thought and action\u2014you can turn clear think-\ning into effective decisions. In Part 4 I share the most practical tools you can use to solve problems.\n\nFinally, once you have mastered the skills of making your defaults work for instead of against you and maximizing the tool\nthat is your rational mind, I\u2019ll turn to perhaps the most important question of all: the question of what your goals are in the first\nplace. All the successful execution in the world is worthless if it\u2019s not in service of the right outcome, but how do you decide what\n\nthat is?\n\f"}, "000934.png": {"text": "Along the way, I\u2019ll show you the most effective approaches to thinking in a way few people talk about. We won't use fancy\njargon, spreadsheets, or decision trees. Instead, we'll focus on the practical skills I\u2019ve learned from others, discovered on my own,\nand tested on thousands of people from various organizations, cultures, and industries.\n\nTogether we'll uncover the missing link between behavioral science and real-world results and turn ordinary moments into\nextraordinary results.\n\nThe lessons in this book are simple, practical, and timeless. They draw heavily on the wisdom of others and my own lived ex-\nperience putting them into practice. I relied on these lessons and insights to make better decisions inside the intelligence agency,\nbuild and scale multiple businesses, and surprisingly become a better parent. How you use them is up to you.\n\nIf there is a tagline to my life, it is \u201cMastering the best of what other people have already figured out,\u201d and this bookis a tribute\nto that belief. I\u2019ve done my best to attribute those ideas to the people who deserve the credit. I\u2019ve probably missed some, and for\nthat I apologize. When you put things into practice, they become part of you.

Yet\nthese ordinary moments often matter more to our success than the big decisions. This can be difficult to appreciate.\n\nWe think that if only we get the big things right, everything will magically fall into place. If we choose to marry the right\nperson, it\u2019ll all be okay. If we choose the right career, we'll be happy. If we pick the right investment, we'll be rich. This wisdom is, at\nbest, partially true. You can marry the most amazing person in the world, but if you take them for granted, it will end. You can pick\nthe best career, but if you don\u2019t work your butt off, you won't get opportunities. You can find the perfect investment, only to look at\nyour savings account and have nothing to invest. Even when we get the big decisions directionally right, we\u2019re not guaranteed to\nget the results we want.\n\nWe don\u2019t think of ordinary moments as decisions. No one taps us on the shoulder as we react to a comment by a coworker to\ntell us that we're about to pour either gasoline or water onto this flame. Of course, if we knew we were about to make the situation\n\nworse, we wouldn\u2019t. No one tries to win the moment at the expense of the decade, and yet that is often how it goes.\n\f"}, "000936.png": {"text": "The enemies of clear thinking\u2014the more primal parts of our nature\u2014make it hard to see what\u2019s happening and instead just\nmake our lives more challenging. When we react with emotion to a colleague in a meeting, we must make amends. When we make\na decision to prove we're right rather than get the best outcome possible, we only end up with a mess to clean up later. If we start\nbickering with our partner on Friday, the entire weekend can be lost. No wonder we have less energy, more stress, and feel busy all\nthe time.\n\nIn most ordinary moments the situation thinks for us. We don\u2019t realize it at the time because these moments seem so insignifi-\ncant. However, as days turn into weeks and weeks into months, the accumulation of these moments makes accomplishing our\ngoals easier or harder.\n\nEach moment puts you in a better or worse position to handle the future. It\u2019s that positioning that eventually makes life easier\nor harder. When our ego takes over and we show someone we're the boss, we make the future harder. When we are passive-aggres-\nsive with a colleague at work, our relationship becomes worse. And while these moments don\u2019t seem to matter much at the time,\nthey compound into our current position. And our position determines our future.\n\nA good position allows you to think clearly rather than be forced by circumstances into a decision. One reason the best in the\nworld make consistently good decisions is they rarely find themselves forced into a decision by circumstances.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be smarter than others to outperform them if you can out-position them. Anyone looks like a genius when\nthey\u2019re in a good position, and even the smartest person looks like an idiot when they\u2019re in a bad one.\n\nThe greatest aid to judgment is starting from a good position. The company with cash on the balance sheet and low debt has\nnothing but good options to choose from. When bad times come, and they always do, their options go from good to great. On the\nother hand, a company with no cash and high debt has nothing but bad options to choose from. Things quickly go from bad to\nworse. And this example easily extends beyond the boardroom as well.\n\nTime is the friend of someone who is properly positioned and the enemy of someone poorly positioned.

Bookstores are full of books that assume the problem is our ability to reason. They list the steps we should take\nand the tools we should use to exercise better judgment. If you know you should be thinking, these can be helpful.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned from watching real people in action is that, just like the angry CEO, they\u2019re often unaware circumstances are\nthinking for them. It\u2019s as if we expect the inner voice in our head to say, \u201cSTOP! THIS Is AMOMENT WHEN YOU NEED TO THINK!\u201d\n\nAnd because we don\u2019t know we should be thinking, we cede control to our impulses.\n\nIn the space between stimulus and response, one of two things can happen. You can consciously pause and apply reason to the\nsituation. Or you can cede control and execute a default behavior.\n\nThe problem is, our default behavior often makes things worse.\n\nWhen someone slights us, we lash out with angry words.\n\f"}, "000942.png": {"text": "When someone cuts us off, we assume malice on their part.\n\nWhen things go slower than we want, we become frustrated and impatient.\n\nWhen someone is passive-aggressive, we take the bait and escalate.\n\nIn these moments of reaction, we don\u2019t realize that our brains have been hijacked by our biology, and that the outcome will go\nagainst what we seek. We don\u2019t realize that hoarding information to gain an advantage is hurting the team. We don\u2019t realize we\u2019re\nconforming to the group\u2019s ideas when we should be thinking for ourselves. We don\u2019t realize our emotions are making us react in\nways that create problems downstream.\n\nSo our first step in improving our outcomes is to train ourselves to identify the moments when judgment is called for in the\nfirst place, and pause to create space to think clearly. This training takes a lot of time and effort, because it involves counterbalanc-\ning our hardwired biological defaults evolved over many centuries. But mastery over the ordinary moments that make the future\n\neasier or harder is not only possible, it\u2019s the critical ingredient to success and achieving your long-term goals.\n\nThe High Cost of Losing Control\n\nReacting without reasoning makes every situation worse.\n\nConsider a common scenario that I\u2019ve seen countless times. A coworker slights a project you're leading in a meeting. Instinc-\ntively you hit back with a comment that undermines them or their work.

The derailed\nmeeting needs to be rescheduled. You might need to talk to the other people in the meeting to clear the air. And even after all of\nthis, you might still be worse off than you were before.

When someone chal-\nlenges our beliefs, we stop listening and go on the attack. No thoughts, just pure animal instinct.\n\nWe're naturally wired to organize the world into a hierarchy. We do this to help make sense of the world, maintain our\nbeliefs, and generally feel better. But when someone infringes on our place in the world and our understanding of how it works, we\nreact without thinking. When someone cuts you off on the highway and road rage kicks in, that\u2019s your unconscious mind saying,\n\u201cwho are you to cut me off?\u201d You're reacting to a threat to your inherent sense of hierarchy.

The emotion default: we tend to respond to feelings rather than reasons and facts.\n\n2. The ego default: we tend to react to anything that threatens our sense of self-worth or our position in a group hierarchy.\n3. The social default: we tend to conform to the norms of our larger social group.\n\n4. The inertia default: we\u2019re habit forming and comfort seeking.

Each on their own is enough to cause unforced errors,\nbut when they act together, things quickly go from bad to worse.\n\nPeople who master their defaults get the best real-world results.

The list goes\non.\n\nEmotions can multiply all of your progress by zero. It doesn\u2019t matter how much you've thought about or worked at something,\nit can all be undone in an instant. No one is immune. The Olympian Matthew Emmons, for instance, was a prodigy who\u2019d come to\ndominate the field of competitive rifle shooting. He was poised to win his second Olympic gold when the emotion default worked\nits mischief. Emmons was in the final round. He aimed. He fired. Bullseye. The only problem: he shot at the wrong target!

Sometimes, it comes from a track record of applying deep knowledge successfully, and other\ntimes it comes from the shallowness of reading an article. It\u2019s amazing how often the ego turns unearned knowledge into reckless\nconfidence.\n\nA little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, as one of my kids learned the hard way. Not wanting to write out his homework\nin French, which would take a lot of time and effort, he realized he could write it out in English and put it through an online trans-\nlator. When I asked him how he finished so quickly, he told me it was easy and left it at that. Of course, his French teacher realized\nwhat he had done and gave him a zero.\n\nOur ego tempts us into thinking we\u2019re more than we are. Left unchecked, it can turn confidence into overconfidence or even\narrogance. We get a bit of knowledge on the internet and suddenly we are full of hubris. Everything seems easy. As a result, we take\nrisks that we may not understand we're taking. We must resist this kind of unearned confidence, though, if we are to get the re-\nsults we desire.\n\nRecently, after a talk I attended on the growing homeless population, the person sitting next to me commented on how easy\nit would be to solve this deep and complex issue.

Having them depend on us makes us feel not only necessary but powerful. The more people who\ndepend on us the more powerful we feel. However, this position is often self-defeating.

We're prone to being less concerned with\nactual greatness than with exuding the appearance of greatness.

He had a jealous disposition and\nfrequently complained about Congress promoting younger, less competent officers ahead of him. He was quick to react to social\nslights, both real and imagined.

Around this time, Arnold sought the hand of Peggy Shippen, the daughter of\na wealthy Philadelphia family.\n\nThe Shippens were loyalist sympathizers interested in making connections only with similarly wealthy people. Arnold, how-\never, was not wealthy. His alcoholic father had squandered the family fortune when Arnold was a boy.

It turned out, however, that Arnold had been using his position as military governor to benefit himself\nfinancially. Eventually, his case was brought before a court martial. General Washington gave Arnold only a light reprimand, yet\nArnold felt that Washington had betrayed him.\n\nAshort while later, he would go on to betray his country.\n\nArnold\u2019s pride had been wounded.

He\u2019d drive up in his fancy car, park it illegally outside, and run in\nto get something. When there was a line, he\u2019d rudely comment and raise his voice telling everyone to hurry up.

One measure of a\nperson is the degree to which they'll do the right thing when it goes against the popular belief. However, it is easy to overestimate\nour willingness to diverge from the crowd, and underestimate our biological instinct to fit in.\n\nThe social default encourages us to outsource our thoughts, beliefs, and outcomes to others.

I was\nlucky to get out before it became apparent to everyone else\u2014I came awfully close to losing a whole lot of money.=2\n\nThe inertia default pushes us to maintain the status quo. Starting something is hard but so too is stopping something.! We\nresist change even when change is for the best.\n\nThe Latin word inertia means literally \u201cinertness\u201d: that is, laziness or idleness. In physics, \u201cinertia\u201d refers to an object resisting\nachange in its state of motion. Hence, a popular way of stating Newton's first law of motion\u2014the law of inertia\u2014is this: \u201cA body in\nmotion tends to stay in motion, and a body at rest tends to stay at rest.\u201d\n\nObjects never change if they\u2019re left alone. They don\u2019t start moving on their own, nor do they stop moving till something stops\nthem.\u21222 This law of physics can also be applied to human behavior and our instinct to resist even beneficial change. The physicist\nLeonard Mlodinow sums it up this way: \u201cOnce our minds are set in a direction, they tend to continue in that direction unless acted\nupon by some outside force.\u201d2 This cognitive inertia is why changing our minds is hard.\n\nInertia keeps us in jobs we hate and in relationships that don\u2019t make us happy, because in both cases we know what to expect\nand it\u2019s comforting to have our expectations reliably met.\n\nOne reason we resist change is that keeping things the way they are requires almost no effort. This helps explain why we get\ncomplacent. It takes a lot of effort to build momentum but far less to maintain it. Once something becomes \u201cgood enough,\u201d we can\nstop the effort and still get decent results. The inertia default leverages our desire to stay in our comfort zone, relying on old tech-\nniques or standards even when they\u2019re no longer optimal.\n\nAnother reason we tend to push back against change is that doing something different might lead to worse results. There is an\nasymmetry to change\u2014we take negative results to heart more than positive ones. Worse results make us stand out for the wrong\nreasons. Why risk looking like an idiot when you can remain average? We'd rather be average than risk the possibility of landing\n\nsomewhere below average.\n\f"}, "000963.png": {"text": "Inertia is evident in many of our daily habits, such as when we stick to the same grocery store brand even if a new, superior one\nappears on the market. This reluctance to try new products is often due to the uncertainty and effort involved in evaluating them.\nTo combat this, companies often offer free samples to customers, which serves as a low-risk way for them to try a new product and\nevaluate its quality without the fear of disappointment.\n\nWe like to think we\u2019re open-minded and willing to change our beliefs when the facts change, but history has shown otherwise.\nWhen the automobile was first introduced, many critics dismissed it as a mere fad, arguing that horses and carriages were a more\nreliable mode of transportation. Similarly, when the airplane was first invented, people were skeptical of its practicality and safety.\nThe radio, television, and internet all faced similar initial skepticism, yet despite this, each of these inventions has had a profound\nimpact on the way we live today.\n\nThe \u201czone of average\u201d is a dangerous place when it comes to inertia. It\u2019s the point where things are working well enough that\nwe don\u2019t feel the need to make any changes. We hope things will magically improve. Of course, they rarely do. For example, staying\nin a relationship that is too good to leave and too bad to stay is a perfect example of the zone of average. If things were much worse,\n\nwe would act, but since they\u2019re not terrible, we stay, and hope things get better.\n\nDoubling Down When You're Wrong\n\nAs the famous quote often falsely attributed to Charles Darwin goes, \u201cIt\u2019s not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the\nmost intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.\u201d2 Even though it\u2019s a misquotation, it\u2019s not useless just\nbecause it\u2019s not Darwin.\n\nWhen circumstances change, we need to adapt. But inertia closes minds and stifles the motivation to change how we've been\ndoing things. It makes it harder to imagine alternative methods, and discourages experimentation and course correction.\n\nFor instance, public statements can create inertia. Putting something on the record establishes expectations along with social\n\npressure to meet those expectations. When new information challenges one of our statements, we might instinctively dismiss it\n\f"}, "000964.png": {"text": "and emphasize the old information that supported it. We want to be consistent with what we said. Changing our minds becomes\nincreasingly difficult. We witness how, say, people label a politician a \u201cflip-flopper\u201d instead of \u201cintelligent\u201d when they change their\nposition in response to the facts, and our fear of the social implications of changing our minds continues to grow.\n\nInertia also prevents us from doing hard things. The longer we avoid the hard thing we know we should do, the harder it be-\ncomes to do. Avoiding conflict is comfortable and easy. The longer we avoid the conflict, however, the more necessary it becomes to\ncontinue avoiding it. What starts out as avoiding a small but difficult conversation quickly grows into avoiding a large and seem-\ningly impossible one. The weight of what we avoid eventually affects our relationship.\n\nGroups create inertia of their own. They tend to value consistency over effectiveness, and reward people for maintaining the\nstatus quo. Inertia makes deviating from group norms difficult. The threat of standing out in a negative way too often keeps people\nin line. As a result, group dynamics end up favoring people who don\u2019t deviate from the defaults.\n\nGroup inertia is partly responsible for why a friend of mine, and I suspect a host of others, got married in the first place.\nAccording to him, in hindsight, \u201cAll the signs were there that it might not work out, but it seemed like a lot to start over with some-\none new, and everyone around us was getting engaged, so that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nThe influence of inertia isn\u2019t just troubling in our work and relationships, it can also be bad for our health. In 1910, America\u2019s\nleading expert on industrial toxicology, Alice Hamilton, was appointed to head a survey on industrial illness in the state of Illinois.\nOver the next few years, she provided definitive evidence of the dangers of lead exposure in the workplace and of lead-tainted ex-\nhaust fumes from automobiles. But despite the evidence, General Motors and other car manufacturers continued producing lead-\nfueled vehicles. It wasn\u2019t until the 1980s that the US finally banned leaded fuel. Even today, lead continues to be used for other ap-\nplications, despite the availability of nontoxic options at a similar price.4\n\nInertia keeps us doing things that don\u2019t get us what we want. It operates in our subconscious largely undetected until its\neffects are too hard to counter. Later I\u2019ll discuss more examples of the inertia default at work and how to combat it.

If we want to improve our behavior, accomplish more of our goals, and\nexperience greater joy and meaning in our lives, we need to learn to manage our defaults.\n\nThe good news is that the same biological tendencies that make us react without reasoning can be reprogrammed into forces\nfor good.\n\nThink of your default patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting as algorithms you\u2019ve been programmed to run unconsciously\nin response to inputs from other people or the environment. We don\u2019t think about moving our knee when the doctor hits it with\na reflex hammer. It just moves. The same thing happens with your thoughts and actions. We receive some type of input from the\n\nworld and then execute an algorithm that processes that input and automatically produces an output.\n\f"}, "000967.png": {"text": "Many of the algorithms you're running have been programmed into you by evolution, culture, ritual, your parents, and your\ncommunity. Some of these algorithms help move you closer to what you want; others move you further away.\n\nYou unconsciously adopt the habits of the people you spend time with, and those people make it easier or harder for you to\nachieve progress toward what you want to achieve. The more time you spend with people, the more likely you start to think and\nact as they do.\n\nEventually, almost everyone loses the battle with willpower; it\u2019s only a matter of time. Consider my parents. Neither of them\nsmoked when they joined the armed forces, but it didn\u2019t take long for them to follow the lead of their smoking coworkers. At first,\nthey resisted, but as the days turned into weeks, the grind of constantly saying no wore them down. Decades later, quitting proved\nnearly impossible because everyone around them smoked. The very same force that encouraged them to start was now preventing\nthem from stopping. They were only able to kick their habit when they changed their environment. They had to find new friends\nwhose default behavior was their desired behavior.\n\nThat\u2019s just how it goes sometimes when we're forming or breaking habits. What may look like discipline often involves a care-\nfully created environment to encourage certain behaviors. And what may look like poor choices is often just someone trying their\nbest to use willpower and bumping up against their defaults. The people with the best defaults are typically the ones with the best\nenvironment. Sometimes it\u2019s part of a deliberate strategy, and sometimes it\u2019s just plain luck. Either way, it\u2019s easier to align yourself\nwith the right behavior when everyone else is already doing it.\n\nThe way to improve your defaults isn\u2019t by willpower but by creating an intentional environment where your desired behavior\nbecomes the default behavior.\n\nJoining groups whose default behaviors are your desired behavior is an effective way to create an intentional environment. If\nyou want to read more, join a book club. If you want to run more, join a running club. If you want to exercise more, hire a trainer.\nYour chosen environment, rather than your willpower alone, will help nudge you toward the best choices.\n\nIt\u2019s easier said than done, though. Reprogramming a computer is simply a matter of rewriting lines of code, while reprogram-\n\nming yourself is a longer and more involved process. It\u2019s this process that I describe in the chapters that follow.\n\f"}, "000968.png": {"text": "PART 2\n\nBUILDING STRENGTH\n\nCriticizing others is easier than coming to know yourself.\n\n\u2014BRUCE LEE\n\f"}, "000969.png": {"text": "COUNTERACTING THE ENEMIES of clear thinking requires more than willpower.\n\nOur defaults work off deeply ingrained biological tendencies\u2014our tendencies for self-preservation, for recognizing and\nmaintaining social hierarchies, and for defending ourselves and our territory. We can't simply know these tendencies exist\nand then will them out of existence. On the contrary, the feeling that willpower is all it takes to remove these forces is one of\nthe tricks they use to keep us under their control.\n\nTo stop our defaults from impeding good judgment, we need to harness equally powerful biological forces. We need to\ntake the same forces that the defaults would use to ruin us and turn them to our advantage. Chief among them is the force\nof inertia.\n\nInertia is a double-edged sword. We saw earlier that inertia is a tendency to maintain the status quo. If the status quo is\nsub-optimal or dysfunctional, inertia works against us. But the status quo doesn\u2019t have to be sub-optimal. If you train your-\nself to consistently think, feel, and act in ways that further your most important goals\u2014f, in other words, you build strength\n\u2014then inertia becomes a nearly unstoppable force that unlocks your potential.\n\nEstablishing rituals is the key to creating positive inertia. Rituals focus the mind on something other than the moment.\nThey can be as simple as taking a quick pause before responding to someone's point of contention at work. One of my old\nmentors used to tell me, \u201cWhen someone slights you in a meeting, take a deep breath before you speak and watch how\noften you change what you're about to say.\u201d\n\nRituals are hidden in plain sight anywhere temperament matters for performance. The next time you watch a basketball\ngame or tennis match, notice how the players always bounce the ball the same number of times before shooting a free\nthrow or serving. It doesn\u2019t matter if the previous play was the best or worst of your career. Rituals force the mind to focus\non the next play, not the last one.\n\nStrength is the power to press pause on your defaults and exercise good judgment. It doesn\u2019t matter what's going on\nin the world, or how unfair things may seem. It doesn\u2019t matter that you feel embarrassed, threatened, or angry.

I had all of these meetings and got pulled into this other project the director said\nwas top priority. And ... I planned to work on it Friday morning, but the bus got stuck in the snow, and it took two hours to get to\nwork.\u201d\n\nIthought I kept my composure pretty well, but my inner dialogue was even more defensive. It went something like this: \u201cDude!\nCut me some slack. It\u2019s Sunday. I haven\u2019t had a vacation in years. I spend way more time with you than with my girlfriend. I\u2019m\ndoing the best I can, and nothing I do ever seems to be enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you're telling me this wasn't your fault?\u201d he said innocently, setting a trap I didn\u2019t see.\n\n\u201cLook, a lot of stuff came up that I couldn't control,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll get it done today.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit! It is your fault.

It\u2019s Your Fault\n\nWhen people's actions have outcomes that don\u2019t line up with how they see themselves, they tend to insulate their egos by blaming\nother people or unfavorable circumstances. Psychologists even have a term for this tendency. They call it self-serving bias, a habit\nof evaluating things in ways that protect or enhance our self-image. Statements like \u201cIt was a great idea just poorly executed,\u201d \u201cWe\ndid the best we could,\u201d and \u201cWe never should\u2019ve been in this situation in the first place\u201d are often manifestations of this bias.\u00a92\nHere\u2019s the thing: It might be true. Maybe it really wasn\u2019t a bad idea, just bad execution. Maybe you really did do the best you\ncould. Maybe you never should have been in that situation in the first place.

People suffer misfortune all the time for reasons beyond their control: stray bullets, diseases,\ngetting struck by a drunk driver.\n\nComplaining does nothing to change the present situation you find yourself in, though.

All the energy you put toward things you don\u2019t control\ncomes out of the energy you can put toward the things you can.\n\nWhile no one chooses difficult circumstances, adversity provides opportunity. It allows us to test ourselves, and see who we've\nbecome. The test isn\u2019t against other people, though; it\u2019s against our former selves. Are we better than we were yesterday? When\ncircumstances are easy, it\u2019s hard to distinguish ordinary people from extraordinary ones, or to see the extraordinary within our-\nselves. As the Roman slave Publilius Syrus once said, \u201cAnyone can steer the ship when the sea is calm.\u201d=4\n\nThe path to being exceptional begins when you decide to be responsible for your actions no matter the situation.

You're focused on your ego\nnot the outcome.\n\nSolutions appear when you stop bargaining and start accepting the reality of the situation.

You're better than you were in that moment.\u201d\n\nThen he didn\u2019t say another word to me until the next day.\n\nThe lesson was an important one: the things you choose not to do often matter as much as the things you choose to do. The\nreal test of a person is the degree to which they are willing to nonconform to do the right thing.\n\nIt took a while for me to realize that he was more disappointed in me for not stopping the others than for being there in the\nfirst place.2 He didn\u2019t want me to become a passive person\u2014the kind of person whose behavior is dictated by the people and events\naround him. He didn\u2019t want me to become a chronic victim of circumstances.\n\nNo successful person wants to work with a chronic victim. The only people who want to work with victims are other victims.\n\nIf you pay attention to chronic victims, you'll notice how fragile they are\u2014how dependent their attitudes and feelings are on\nthings they don\u2019t control. When things go their way, they\u2019re happy; when things don't, they\u2019re defensive, passive-aggressive, and\noccasionally aggressive-aggressive. If their spouse is in a bad mood, they\u2019re in a bad mood too. If they hit traffic on the way to work,\nthey bring their anger and frustration to work with them. If a project they\u2019re leading isn\u2019t on track, they blame someone on their\nteam.\n\nSelf-accountability is the strength of realizing that even though you don\u2019t control everything, you do control how you respond\nto everything. It\u2019s a mindset that empowers you to act and not just react to whatever life throws at you. It transforms obstacles\ninto opportunities for learning and growth. It means realizing that the way you respond to hardship matters more to your happi-\n\nness than the hardship itself.

Other people, however, decide to take command of their life.\nThey seize the helm, decide where they want to go, and steer the ship in that direction despite the waves. They still experience ups\nand downs like everybody else; they just don\u2019t allow those waves of emotion to determine the direction of their life. Instead, they\nturn the wheel as needed using good judgment to keep themselves on course.\n\nSelf-control is about creating space for reason instead of just blindly following instincts. It\u2019s about being able to view and\nmanage your emotions as if they were inanimate objects\u2014things that don\u2019t have the power to determine what you do unless you\nlet them. It\u2019s about putting distance between yourself and your emotions, and realizing that you have the power to determine how\nyou respond to them. You can react when they prompt you, or instead think clearly and consider whether they\u2019re worth following.\n\nThe emotion default tries to remove any distance between you and your emotions, triggering a reaction in the absence of any\ndeliberation. It wants to win the present moment, even if it means sabotaging the future. Self-control empowers you to keep emo-\ntion in check, though.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen a toddler throw a tantrum, you've seen what the emotion default can do with someone who hasn\u2019t learned\nself-control. What's truly frightening is that some adults are only marginally better than a toddler at fending it off. These are peo-\nple who lack self-control and are routinely carried away by their emotions.\n\nA large part of achieving success is having the self-control to do whatever needs to be done, regardless of whether you feel\nlike doing it at the moment. Emotional intensity is far less important in the long run than disciplined consistency. Inspiration\nand excitement might get you going, but persistence and routine are what keep you going until you reach your goals. Anyone can\nmaintain excitement for a few minutes, but the longer a project takes, the fewer the people who can maintain their excitement for\n\nit.

Confident people\nhave the strength to admit weaknesses and vulnerabilities, to acknowledge that other people might be better at something than\nthey are, and to ask when they need help.\n\nIt\u2019s only human to have doubts about whether you are up to a given task. Even the most capable people have doubts about this\nfrom time to time. But those who have self-confidence never give in to feelings of despair or worthlessness. That\u2019s just another ego\ntrap. Instead, confident people stay focused on completing the task at hand, even if it involves relying on the help of others to do so.\n\nEvery successful task only further serves to deepen your trust in yourself, and that\u2019s how confidence is earned.\n\nConfidence also Comes from How You Talk to Yourself\n\nMore dreams die from a lack of confidence than a lack of competence.

That wasn't possible, however, because the climb down was\nfar more dangerous than the jump\u2014one small error and he would have landed on a bed of sharp rocks. The more he looked down,\nthe more nervous he became. I had to do something to help him help himself out of this situation.\n\nThe first thing we did was to focus on our breathing. Your breath is a powerful tool that helps you calm your mind. We started\ntaking a normal inhale and then immediately inhaling again with a smaller breath. It\u2019s the same way we naturally breathe when\nwe're sobbing, and the results are similarly soothing. Only once we had relaxed our physical bodies could we change our inner\ndialogue.\n\nIasked him how he was talking to himself at that moment\u2014and it wasn\u2019t good. He was beating himself up, telling himself\nhow dumb it had been to climb up in the first place, how he should have known better, and how scared he was. This is the same\nway we all tend to talk to ourselves sometimes\u2014or at least it is in my experience.\n\nThe second thing we did was change the conversation he was having inside his head. We know how the words we say to other\npeople impact how they feel, but we rarely think of how the words we say to ourselves impact us. I asked him to list off some of the\nthings he\u2019d already done that he had feared before doing them. The question was barely out of my mouth when he started to tell\nme about snowboarding and the time we \u201cmistakenly\u201d ended up on a double black diamond and the first time he went wakeboard-\ning. The list went on. There was no shortage of situations he\u2019d been in that had required courage.\n\nOnce he realized he had done difficult things before for the first time, he went back to focusing on his breathing. Then he\njumped.

We all have to deal with the world as it is, not as we want it to be. The\nquicker you stop denying inconvenient truths and start responding to difficult realities, the better.\n\nWe all have something that we're denying right now because accepting it is hard, and we want to avoid the pain.

But there was an alternative\u2014a solution that was simpler, lower cost, and\ncarried less risk. It was objectively a better solution. The only problem was that it was her rival\u2019s.\n\nAs she detailed some of her thinking, she spent a lot of time and effort defending herself, trying to prove her solution was the\nbetter one. She only succeeded in making it clear that she knew her own solution wasn\u2019t the best. She was on the wrong side of\nright. She just didn\u2019t want to admit it.\n\nMany people feel the same way: they think they\u2019ll be worthless if they\u2019re not right. I myself used to feel the same way. Rather\nthan let her figure out her mistake the hard way, I shared some of the harsh and expensive lessons I\u2019d learned about that mindset\nand about being on the wrong side of right.\n\nItold her that for the longest time, I thought if the best idea wasn\u2019t my idea, I\u2019d be nothing.

Why wouldn't you?

On numerous occasions, for instance, you've been\ncajoled into buying things you didn\u2019t want from pushy salespeople, and you've agreed to take on jobs you didn\u2019t have the band-\nwidth for by pushy colleagues. You don\u2019t trust yourself to do better in the future using sheer willpower alone.\n\nTo protect yourself from the influence of the social default, you decide to implement a safeguard. You form a rule for yourself:\nnever say yes to something important without thinking it over for a day.\n\nPracticing this safeguard isn\u2019t very enjoyable. Putting someone on hold for a day might be uncomfortable in the moment, but\nthe long-term results of implementing this safeguard are worth it. As simple as they seem, automatic rules for common situations\nget results. We'll explore automatic rules in the next chapter.\n\nImplementing this plan illustrates all four of the strengths I\u2019ve mentioned.

Not only that, but they also did it with a salary\ncap designed to level the playing field and make dynasties like theirs impossible. When all-star cornerback Darrelle Revis, who was\nthe best in the game at his position, was a few minutes late for a practice one day, Coach Belichick sent him home immediately.\nBelichick didn\u2019t make a big deal about it, but he was firm. Revis wouldn't be treated differently from other players. Coach didn\u2019t\n\ncare what star players got away with on other teams. Revis was a New England Patriot, and he had to rise to the team\u2019s standards.\n\f"}, "000997.png": {"text": "The best teachers expect more from their students and from themselves.

This tactic takes advantage of one of our\ndefaults: we love correcting people. If someone does something wrong, we almost can\u2019t help but tell them how to do it the right\nway.

But\nlazy.\n\nIdidn\u2019t want to spend the rest of the evening (or my career) correcting this guy\u2019s work for him. I needed a way of changing his\nbehavior. But how?\n\nIremembered a story I'd read about Henry Kissinger. A staffer had drafted a memo and left it on Kissinger\u2019s desk for him to\nread. A while later Kissinger approached him and asked if it was his best work. The staffer said no and rewrote the entire memo.\nThe next day the staffer ran into Kissinger again and asked what he thought. Kissinger asked him again if this was the best he\ncould do. The staffer took the memo and rewrote it yet again. The next morning the same scenario played out, only this time the\npoor staffer stated that yes indeed it was his best work. Kissinger replied, \u201cOkay, now I'll read it.\u201d\n\nI decided to adopt Kissinger\u2019s approach.

We tell ourselves it\u2019s\ngood enough, or the best we can manage given our time constraints. But the truth is, at least in this particular thing, we\u2019re not\ncommitted to excellence.\n\nWhen we accept substandard work from others, it\u2019s for the same reason: we're not all in. When you're committed to excel-\nlence, you don\u2019t let anyone on your team half-ass it. You set the bar, you set it high, and you expect anyone working with you to\nwork just as hard and level up to what you expect or above. Anything less is unacceptable.\n\nWhen Zhang Ruimin took over as CEO at the Qingdao Refrigerator Plant, the precursor to the appliance company Haier, the\ncompany was close to failure. To send a clear signal to his new employees, Ruimin gathered them outside to witness seventy-six\nsubstandard refrigerators smashed to pieces by a sledgehammer. Ruimin kept a sledgehammer in a glass case in the boardroom for\n\nthe remainder of his tenure, as a symbol of the high standard he expected from the company.2\n\nExcellence Demands Excellence\n\nMasters of their craft don\u2019t merely want to check off a box and move on. They\u2019re dedicated to what they do, and they keep at it.\n\nMaster-level work requires near fanatical standards, so masters show us what our standards should be.

Exemplars can be people you work with, people you admire,\nor even people who lived long ago. It doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is they make you better in a certain area, like a skill,\ntrait, or value.\n\n(b) Practice imitating them in certain ways. Create space in the moment to reflect on what they'd do in your position, and\n\nthen act accordingly.\n\nLet\u2019s consider these components one at a time.\nIn the previous section, we discussed something most people never think about: if you don\u2019t curate the people in your life, the\npeople who end up surrounding you will be there by chance and not by choice. That group includes your parents, your friends,\n\nyour family, your coworkers. Sure, your high school friends might be great examples of character and acumen, but odds are they\u2019re\n\f"}, "001001.png": {"text": "average. Sure, your parents might be some of the smartest businesspeople in the world, but odds are they\u2019re not. It\u2019s not that you\nshould remove these people from your life, though; controlling your environment just means intentionally adding exemplars into\n\nthe mix.\n\nYour Exemplars\n\nShow me your role models and I\u2019ll show you your future.\n\nWhen | first started working at a three-letter intelligence agency, I looked up to my colleague Matt. He was one of the best in\nthe world at understanding how operating systems work and the various ways you can use them to your advantage. What struck\nme most about Matt was his incredibly high standards. Like Michael Jordan, Matt combined natural talent with a first-class work\nethic. And he demanded perfection. (Is it any wonder that he was one of the best in the world?)\n\nYou couldn\u2019t say anything around Matt unless you really knew what you were talking about, or he\u2019d correct you. He raised the\nbar for the entire team. Not only did he work harder than anyone else, but he consistently came up with elegant solutions to com-\nplicated problems. Matt was an exemplar: someone who modeled an exemplary way of being. He showed you what was possible.\n\nI got lucky. Chance could\u2019ve given me an average boss. Instead, it gave me Matt. The thing is, though, you don\u2019t have to rely on\nluck. It\u2019s possible for you to choose the people whose behavior you emulate\u2014your exemplars\u2014rather than merely hope you end up\nworking with one of them.\n\nWhen you choose the right exemplars\u2014people with standards higher than yours\u2014you can transcend the standards you've\ninherited from parents, friends, and acquaintances. Your exemplars show you what your standards should be. As Peter Kaufman\nonce told me, \u201cNo technique has been more responsible for my success in life than studying and adopting the good models of\nothers.\u201d\n\nThis wisdom has been around for a long time. In his letters to Lucilius, Seneca urges him to choose a role model or exemplar to\n\nprovide a standard to live by:\n\f"}, "001002.png": {"text": "The mind should have someone whom it can respect\u2014someone whose authority might make even its inner shrine\nmore hallowed .... Happy is he who can so respect a man that the very memory of that man can calm and direct him!\nHe who can thus respect another will quickly be respected himself. Therefore, choose a Cato, or if this seems too strict\nfor you, choose a gentler spirit\u2014a man like Laelius. Choose someone whose life and speech pleases you, and who\ndisplays outwardly the same character he has. Present him to yourself always as your guardian or exemplar. There is\nneed, I insist, for someone against whom to measure our way of life; unless you have a ruler, you can\u2019t straighten what\n\nis crooked.t\n\nThe people we choose as our exemplars exhibit the principles, the resolve, and the overall patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting\nthat we want to make our own. Their example helps us navigate the world. It becomes our North Star.\n\nMost people didn\u2019t want to adopt Matt\u2019s standards because those standards were so exacting. Yet if you were willing to put in\nthe work, Matt was a shortcut to excellence hiding in plain sight. People at the far right of the bell curve (the positive outliers) can\nteach you tips, tricks, and insights that might otherwise take a lifetime to learn. They\u2019ve done the heavy lifting. They\u2019ve already\npaid for the lessons, so you don\u2019t have to. Learning from and attempting to live up to Matt\u2019s standards helped me become proficient\nmuch faster than I would have become otherwise.\n\nLook around, find the best examples you can of people with the attributes you want to cultivate\u2014the people whose default\nbehavior is your desired behavior, those who inspire you to raise the bar and make you want to be a better version of yourself.\n\nYour exemplars needn't be alive. They can be either dead or fictional, as well. We can learn from both Atticus Finch and Warren\n\nBuffett, along with Genghis Khan and Batman. It\u2019s up to you.\n\nYour Personal Board of Directors\n\nPut all of your exemplars on your \u201cpersonal board of directors,\u201d a concept that originates with author Jim Collins:\n\f"}, "001003.png": {"text": "Back in the early \u201980s, I made Bill [Lazier] the honorary chairman of my personal board of directors. And when I chose\nmembers ... they were not chosen for their success. They were chosen for their values and their character .... They\u2019re\n\nthe sorts of people I wouldn\u2019t want to let down.2\n\nThe exemplars on your personal board can be a mix of high accomplishment and high character. The only requirement is that they\nhavea skill, attitude, or disposition you want to cultivate in yourself. They don\u2019t have to be perfect. All people have flaws, and your\npersonal board will be no different. But everyone is better than us at something. Our job is to figure out what that something is and\nlearn from it while ignoring the rest.\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes that I see people make is they don\u2019t want to learn from someone who has a character blemish or a\nworldview that doesn\u2019t align with theirs. Seneca captured the right approach when he said in On the Tranquility of the Mind, \u201cI shall\nnever be ashamed of citing a bad author if the line is good.\u201d Or, as Cato the Elder put it, \u201cBe careful not to rashly refuse to learn from\nothers.\u201d2 Don\u2019t throw away the apple because of a bruise on the skin.\n\nYour personal board of directors isn\u2019t static. People come and go. You're always curating the list. To take it back to The Godfa-\nther, sometimes you want the peacetime consigliere and sometimes you want the wartime consigliere. Sometimes you've learned\nwhat you can from someone, and you want to replace them with someone else. Each person tends to lead you to the next.\n\nMasters have a different standard\u2014often one of elegance and beauty. And when you put masters on your board, you raise the\nbar for yourself. What seemed good enough before doesn\u2019t seem good enough anymore.\n\nOne of my exemplars is Charlie Munger, the billionaire business partner of Warren Buffett. He raised my standard for holding\nan opinion. One night at dinner, he commented, \u201cI never allow myself to have an opinion on anything unless I know the other\nside\u2019s argument better than they do.\u201d\n\nTalk about raising the bar! Many people have opinions, but very few have done the work required to hold them. Doing that\n\nwork means you can argue against yourself better than your real opponents can. It forces you to challenge your beliefs because you\n\f"}, "001004.png": {"text": "have to argue from both sides. It\u2019s only when you put in the work that you come to really understand an argument. You understand\nthe reasons for and against it. Through that work you earn the confidence to endorse it.4\n\nThere is no better way to learn than working directly with your heroes. The benefit of working with someone in person is that\nit allows for a natural back-and-forth\u2014more a coaching relationship than a mere model. A personal relationship also allows you\nto ask for help\u2014to reach out when you need it. But working in person with someone you admire isn\u2019t always possible. Still, that\ndoesn\u2019t mean you have to accept the lot of people around you.\n\nThe phone in your pocket literally gives you access to the smartest people who've ever existed, alive or dead. Even if you don\u2019t\nhave direct contact with them, you can often listen to them talk in their own words\u2014unfiltered! Think about that for a second. For\nthe first time in history, you have the opportunity to listen to your exemplars explain things in their own way, without someone\ngetting in the middle.\u2122\n\nIf your hero is Tobi Liitke, who started Shopify, one of the most successful companies in the history of the world, you can find\ncountless interviews with him on the internet. You can sit at the feet of the master and learn as he shares how he thinks, how he\nmakes decisions, how he runs his company. The same goes for Peter D. Kaufman, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Tom Brady, Simone\nBiles, Serena Williams, or Katie Ledecky.\n\nYou can choose among the greats of history: Richard Feynman, George Washington, Charles de Gaulle, Winston Churchill,\nCoco Chanel, Charlie Munger, Marie Curie, Marcus Aurelius. All of them are ready to accept your invitation to be on your personal\nboard. All you need to do is collect the best of them together and unite them in your mind. As Montaigne put it, \u201cI have gathered a\ngarland of other men\u2019s flowers, and nothing is mine but the cord that binds them.\u201d>\n\nYou're never alone if you have a personal board of directors. They\u2019re always there. You can imagine them watching you make\ndecisions and power moves. And once you imagine them watching, your behavior is bound to reflect this new audience. They will\nhelp set the standards that you strive to live up to, and give you a ruler against which to measure yourself. You're not a failure if you\ncome up short\u2014if you don\u2019t write a bestselling book, or become a billionaire, or work out every day. You're not in competition with\n\nyour exemplars. The only person you\u2019re competing with is the person you were yesterday. Victory is being a little better today.\n\f"}, "001005.png": {"text": "Your Repository of Good Behavior\n\nChoosing the right exemplars helps create a repository of \u201cgood behavior.\u201d As you read what people have written, as you talk to\nthem, as you learn from their experiences, as you learn from your own experiences, you begin to build a database of situations and\nresponses. Building this database is one of the most important things you'll ever do because it helps create space for reason in your\nlife. Instead of reacting, and simply copying those around you, you think, \u201cHere\u2019s what the outliers do.\u201d\n\nWhen you face a new situation, you have a catalog of the responses that people on the far right of the bell curve have had in\nsimilar situations. Your baseline response moves from good to great\u2014from reaction to reason.\n\nYour board can pull you in the right direction despite your instincts.\n\nIf we have our board stacked with high-character people, we'll end up wanting to be the highest-character version of ourselves.\n\u2018We'll have the confidence to take a moral stand, and to act alone when the social tide goes the wrong way. We needn't passively fol-\nlow its ebbs and flows. Our personal board gives us the courage and insight to swim in the direction that\u2019s best.\n\nA final note on exemplars: just as other people serve on your personal board of directors, you serve on other people\u2019s boards.\nDenzel Washington reminds us of this point: \u201cYou never know who you touch. You never know how or when you'll have an impact,\nor how important your example can be to someone else.\u201d\u00b0\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the new employee down the hall. Maybe it\u2019s your kids. Maybe it\u2019s your cousin. It doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is\nthere\u2019s someone out there looking up at you and using your behavior as their North Star. Everything you do has the power to\nchange someone else\u2019s life for the better. As Seneca said, \u201cHappy is he who can improve others not just when he is in their presence,\n\nbut even when he is in their thoughts!\u201d2\n\f"}, "001006.png": {"text": "Practice, Practice, Practice\n\nStrengths of character result from habit ....

You also have to follow their example\u2014not just\nonce or twice, but again and again. Only then will you internalize the standards they embody, and become the kind of person you\nwant to be.\n\nImitating your exemplars involves creating space in the moment to exercise reason and evaluate your thoughts, feelings,\nand possible courses of action. Doing this retrains past patterns of behavior so they align more closely with the patterns of your\nexemplars.\n\nOne way of creating space for reason in your thinking is to ask yourself what your exemplars would do if they were in your po-\nsition. It\u2019s the natural next step. Once you imagine them watching, you make decisions and put them into action. If, for instance,\nyou're making an investment decision, ask yourself, \u201cWhat would Warren Buffett do?\u201d Likewise, ask yourself, \u201cHow would I pitch\nthis idea to my personal board of directors? What kinds of factors would they care about? What kinds of factors would they dis-\nmiss as irrelevant?\u201d\n\nIf you imagine your exemplars watching you, you'd tend to do all the things you know they\u2019d want you to do and avoid the\n\nthings you know would get in the way.\n\f"}, "001007.png": {"text": "It\u2019s important to engage in this thoughtful exercise often. You have to keep doing it until you acquire a new pattern of think-\ning, feeling, and acting. Keep practicing until the pattern becomes second nature: an element of who you are, rather than just who\nyou want to be.\n\nOne strategy for building strength is to practice in a sandbox. As you may have guessed, the sandbox is metaphorical\u2014a\nsituation in which any mistakes you make are relatively inconsequential and easily reversed. A sandbox allows you to make and\nlearn from mistakes while containing their cost. Practicing in a sandbox increases the likelihood that you'll be successful when the\nstakes are higher and the outcomes more consequential and less reversible.\n\nOne reason why you usually start out managing just one other person or a small team, rather than an entire organization, is\nthat your failures are contained. Starting with a small-scale management role is one example of a sandbox. When you're running a\nwhole organization, mistakes are costlier and harder to contain than when you're managing a team.\n\nThere's no substitute for practicing with the real thing, yet sandboxes can remove the downside of the mistakes you inevitably\nmake when practicing. At the intelligence agency, we\u2019d always practice and rehearse before an operation in an environment in\nwhich it was safe to fail. We treated the practice as if it were the operation itself; we'd do all the things we planned on doing during\nthe operation, and tried to predict and respond to all the things that could conceivably happen. If something didn\u2019t go as planned,\nwe would adapt. And sometimes we'd fail. Failing in that sandbox, though, provided a learning opportunity with few real-world\n\nconsequences, whereas failing in a real operation could cost people their lives.\n\f"}, "001008.png": {"text": "PART 3\n\nMANAGING WEAKNESS\n\nLife gets easier when you don\u2019t blame other people and focus on what you can control.\n\n\u2014JAMES CLEAR\n\f"}, "001009.png": {"text": "PART OF TAKING command of your life is controlling the things you can.

The cognitive capacities we\u2019ve inherited\nfrom natural selection weren't designed to achieve maximum accuracy, but only enough to increase our chances of survival and\nreproduction. In fact, some of these capacities weren\u2019t designed for accuracy at all.

They\u2019re differ-\nent from shortcomings like, say, lacking a technical skill, because they feel like a referendum on the kind of person we think we are.\nWe are territorial about how we see ourselves and tend to dismiss information that challenges our self-image.\n\nThird, we have a limited perspective. It is very hard to understand a system that we are a part of. Just as you look back on your\nsixteen-year-old self and wonder what you were thinking, your future self will look back on your current self and think the same\nthing. Your present self is blind to the perspective of your future self.\n\nPerspective and human nature make it hard to see our own flaws, and yet it\u2019s easy to see the flaws in others. We are practically\nexperts about where our colleagues and friends are weak and where they are strong. It\u2019s hard to accept, however, that others might\nsee us just as clearly in kind. When we get feedback about our own weaknesses from the world, it\u2019s a rare opportunity for getting\n\nbetter and getting closer to the kind of people we really want to be. Use these opportunities wisely!\n\nBlind Spots on the USS Benfold\n\nThe story of the USS Benfold provides an important example of how to recognize and overcome blind spots.2\n\f"}, "001015.png": {"text": "The Benfold was one of the worst-performing warships in the entire US Navy. Commissioned in 1996 for duty in the Pacific\nFleet, it housed one of the Navy\u2019s most advanced arsenals of missiles and technology at the time. Its radar system was so advanced\nthat it could track a bird from fifty miles. Its mission was to be prepared for war at all times. But it was falling short.\n\nDespite otherwise brilliant military careers, previous commanders had been unable to turn its performance around. So much\nof a ship\u2019s performance comes down to people, not technology.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing more important for a leader than getting the most out of your crew. Often that comes down to removing ob-\nstacles that limit potential. All the technology in the world isn\u2019t going to make you better if the people using it are checked out.\n\nThe destiny of the USS Benfold changed the day Michael Abrashoff was named commander. He was in his mid-thirties when\nthe Navy offered him the Benfold, his first sea command. At the time, he said, the \u201cdysfunctional ship had a sullen crew that re-\nsented being there and could not wait to get out of the Navy.\u201d And yet, in under twenty months, Abrashoff turned the Benfold into\none of the highest-performing ships in the Navy. And he did it within a stifling hierarchy.\n\nBut how?\n\nWhat\u2019s incredible is how he didn\u2019t do it. He didn\u2019t fire or demote anyone. He didn\u2019t change the hierarchy. He didn\u2019t change any\ntechnology. The only real change was within himself. He started to identify his potential blind spots, and to look at the world from\nthe crew\u2019s perspective.\n\nAbrashoff observed one of the ship\u2019s usual Sunday afternoon cookouts shortly after assuming command, and noticed a long\nline of sailors waiting to get their lunch while officers cut to the head of the line to get their food. Not only that, but after getting\ntheir food, the officers went to a private deck to eat apart from the sailors. Imagine you're a sailor on the ship and your boss comes\nand hops the line in front of you. What message does this send? Does it make you want to go all in on your job? Does it make you\nwant to come up with new ideas to help the ship?\n\n\u201cThe officers weren't bad people,\u201d Abrashoff recalls, \u201cthey just didn\u2019t know any different. It\u2019s always been that way.\u201d Rather\nthan approaching the officers and telling them what to do (a typical command-and-control approach that rarely works in the long\n\nterm), Abrashoff simply went to the end of the line.\n\f"}, "001016.png": {"text": "A supply officer approached him and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. You go to the head of the line.\u201d Abrashoff shrugged this off,\nsaying it didn\u2019t seem right to him. He waited in line, got his food, and then sat down with the sailors. The next weekend everyone\nwaited in line and ate together. No command was ever issued.\n\nFrom the start, Abrashoff knew you can\u2019t simply order people to be better. Even if that appears to work, the results are short\nterm and the consequences enormous. It doesn\u2019t matter if you're on a ship or running a manufacturing company. You don\u2019t tap\ninto people's resourcefulness, intelligence, and skills by command-and-control.\n\n\u201cShow me an organization in which employees take ownership, and I will show you one that beats its competitors,\u201d says\nAbrashoff. \u201cCaptains need to see the ship from the crew\u2019s perspective. They need to make it easy and rewarding for crew members\nto express themselves and their ideas.\u201d2\n\nThere is a gap in our thinking that comes from believing that the way we see the world is the way the world really works. It\u2019s\nonly when we change our perspective\u2014when we look at the situation through the eyes of other people\u2014that we realize what we're\n\nmissing. We begin to appreciate our own blind spots and see what we've been missing.\n\f"}, "001017.png": {"text": "CHAPTER 3.2\n\nProtecting Yourself with Safeguards\n\n\u2018THERE ARE MANY INBUILT BIOLOGICAL VULNERABILITIES that can impede good judgment: sleep deprivation, hunger, fatigue, emotion,\ndistraction, stress from feeling rushed, and being in an unfamiliar environment are just some examples. We can\u2019t avoid finding\nourselves in these conditions from time to time. But we can implement safeguards to protect us from our defaults when we are.\n\nSafeguards are tools for protecting ourselves from ourselves\u2014from weaknesses that we don\u2019t have the strength to overcome.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple example. Suppose you want to start eating a healthier diet. You make this task exponentially harder on yourself\nif you inhabit an unhealthy environment\u2014if, say, your pantry and fridge are full of junk food. Purging your home of all junk food is\na safeguard. It protects you against impulsively ripping open a bag of potato chips when you're feeling hungry or bored. Of course,\nyou can still go to the store and buy chips, but that\u2019s a lot of work. You have to think, plan, and act. In the time it takes you to do all\nthat, you might think better of your options, and choose to eat something more in line with your health goals.\n\nPurging your home of all junk food is an example of one safeguarding strategy: increasing the amount of \u201cfriction\u201d required\n\nto do something that\u2019s contrary to your long-term goals. There are lots of safeguard strategies, though. My favorites include pre-\n\f"}, "001018.png": {"text": "vention, creating rules for yourself, making checklists, shifting your frame of reference, and making the invisible visible. Let\u2019s talk\n\nabout each strategy.\n\nSafeguard Strategy 1: Prevention\n\nThe first kind of safeguard aims at preventing problems before they happen. One way to do this is to avoid decision-making in un-\nfavorable conditions. Stress, for instance, is a big contributor to bad decisions. Some studies have shown that stress short-circuits\nthe deliberation process\u2014it undermines the systematic evaluation of alternatives that\u2019s needed for effective decision-making.1\n\nAlcoholics Anonymous has a helpful safeguard for its members. They call it HALT\u2014an acronym that stands for Hungry,\nAngry, Lonely, and Tired. When you feel like having a drink, they say, ask yourself whether any of these conditions apply. If so, deal\nwith the real problem\u2014hunger, anger, loneliness, or fatigue\u2014instead of reaching for a drink.\n\nYou can use the principles behind HALT as a safeguard for decision-making in general. If you have an important decision to\nmake, ask yourself: \u201cAm I hungry? Am I angry or otherwise emotional? Am I lonely or otherwise stressed by my circumstances,\nsuch as being in an unfamiliar environment or pressed for time? Am I tired, sleep-deprived, or physically fatigued?\u201d If the answer\nis yes to any of these questions, avoid making the decision if you can. Wait for a more opportune time. Otherwise, your defaults\n\nwill take over.\n\nSafeguard Strategy 2: Automatic Rules for Success\n\nReactive choices are automatic responses to a stimulus. Most of these responses are below the level of consciousness: We're not\neven aware of them. Sometimes we're able to slow down enough to override our ingrained responses, but this requires a lot of\nconscious effort on our part. Fortunately, there\u2019s an easier way: creating new behaviors that help you get what you want. Think of\n\nthem as automatic rules for success.\n\f"}, "001019.png": {"text": "Nothing forces you to accept the ingrained behaviors and rules from your upbringing and life circumstances. You can decide\nto eliminate them at any time, and replace them with better ones.\n\nIn my conversation with Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, the godfather of cognitive biases and thinking errors, he revealed\nan unexpected way we can improve our judgment: replacing decisions with rules.2 It turns out that rules can help us automate\nour behavior to put us in a position to achieve success and accomplish our goals.\n\nWhen we make decisions, we often think of the goals we want to achieve and work backward to identify the means of achiev-\ning them. If you want to get in shape, you start going to the gym and eating healthier. If you want to save more money, you might\nhide part of your paycheck from yourself every week. We use our willpower to accomplish these goals. Once they\u2019re accomplished,\nwe often go back to the default behavior we had before. Eventually we realize we\u2019re back where we don\u2019t want to be, so we begin the\nentire process again.\n\nThis approach is flawed. It involves constant decision-making and effort. Choosing goals is necessary but not sufficient for ac-\ncomplishing them. You also need to pursue those goals consistently. That means continuing every day to make choices in pursuit\nof your goals. Every day, you have to choose to work out or to skip dessert. As these choices add up, it becomes harder, not easier, to\nconsistently make choices that move you toward your goals and not away from them.\n\nMaking all these choices requires a lot of sustained effort. When we cave into something we didn\u2019t want to do, we offer our-\nselves convenient excuses: \u201cI had a long day,\u201d or \u201cI forgot my gym clothes,\u201d or \u201cI have a lot of prep for tomorrow\u2019s meeting.\u201d Eventu-\nally it becomes easier to make those excuses than to make the choices that lead us to our goals.\n\nWhen it comes to your health, just like many other elements of your life, environment determines behavior. Your environ-\nment makes one path easier than another.\u2122! It\u2019s easier to make healthy food choices if the only foods available to you are good for\nyou. It\u2019s also easier to stick to a consistent pattern of choices if you're in your familiar operating environment. When you're in an\nunfamiliar environment, it\u2019s harder to maintain your familiar patterns of behavior, which is why a lot of people stop exercising or\n\neating healthy when they travel.\n\f"}, "001020.png": {"text": "Your environment isn\u2019t just your physical surroundings. It also includes people. Sometimes it\u2019s hard saying no to someone.\n\u2018We're wired in a way that makes us want to be liked by others, and we're afraid that saying no to someone will make them like us\nless. Saying no to someone repeatedly can be even more difficult. We might say no when our friend offers us a sugary beverage\nafter a workout one day, but if he does it three days in a row, we cave. That\u2019s only human.\n\nWe're also wired to want to fit in with other people. Think of how often you have ended up having a social drink when you\nreally just wanted water. Your friends or colleagues ordered first\u2014a glass of wine, say\u2014and you somehow felt guilty about not or-\ndering a drink yourself. So, you order wine too and compromise on what you really want.\n\nWhy not bypass individual choices altogether and create an automatic behavior\u2014a rule\u2014that requires no decision-making in\nthe moment and that gets no pushback from others? Why not set a rule that you order a social drink only when you actually feel\nlike one, and never just to fit in with what the group is doing?\n\nSimilarly, suppose your goal is to drink less soda.\u21222 Rather than deciding on a case-by-case basis whether you're going to\ndrink soda\u2014something that requires a lot of effort and that is prone to error\u2014make a rule instead. For example, \u201cI only drink soda\nat dinner on Friday,\u201d or maybe, \u201cI don\u2019t drink soda at all.\u201d Having a rule means not having to decide at every meal. The execution\npath is short, and less error prone.\n\nIna quirk of psychology, people typically don\u2019t argue with your personal rules. They just accept them as features of who you\nare. People question decisions, but they respect rules.\n\nKahneman told me his favorite rule was never to say yes to a request on the phone. He knows that he wants people to like him,\nso he wants to say yes in the moment, but after filling up his schedule with things that didn\u2019t make him happy, he decided to be\nmore vigilant about what he agrees to do and why. When people ask him for things over the phone now, he says something along\nthe lines of, \u201cI'll have to get back to you after I think about it.\u201d Not only does this give him time to think without the immediate so-\ncial pressure, but it also allows a lot of these requests to just drop away because people choose not to follow up. He rarely gets back\n\nto any of these people and says yes.\u21223\n\f"}, "001021.png": {"text": "After speaking with Kahneman, I spent some time thinking about what automatic rules I could create for myself so that my\ndesire in the moment didn\u2019t overpower my ultimate desire.\n\nThe way I did this was to imagine a film crew following me around documenting how successful I was.\u21224 Regardless of\nwhether I was a success or not, how would I act to show someone I deserved my success? What would I want them to see? What\nam I doing that I would want them not to see because I\u2019m embarrassed or ashamed?\n\nWhen I run this experiment by people, I am constantly surprised. We all know something we could do to improve our odds of\nsuccess. And we all know something we can stop doing that would also improve our odds of success.\n\nJust because I can\u2019t control all the things I need to do doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t control when I do them. The version of me that I'd\nwant the film crew to see focused on what mattered.\n\nUsing this prompt, I decided to create space every day to work on the biggest opportunities. I imagined the film crew watching\nme make breakfast for the kids and then going to work. While the crew would be expecting to see meetings and people asking me\nfor things, what they\u2019d see is no calls or meetings until lunch so I could spend time working on the most important opportunity.\nThis is where my no-meetings-before-lunch rule came from.\n\n\u2018We're taught our whole lives to follow rules, and yet no one ever told us about how we can create powerful rules that help us\nget what we want. I find it hard to go to the gym three days a week, so my rule is I go every day. I do not feel like going to the gym\nevery day. In fact, some days I hate it. I also know it\u2019s easier to follow my rule than to break it. When it comes to the gym, going\nevery day is easier than going some days.\n\nCreating personal rules is a powerful technique for protecting yourself from your own weaknesses and limitations. Sometimes\n\nthose rules have surprising benefits.\n\nSafeguard Strategy 3: Creating Friction\n\nAnother safeguarding strategy is to increase the amount of effort it takes to do things that are contrary to your goals. I used to find\n\f"}, "001022.png": {"text": "myself checking my email whenever I have a second. I\u2019d check it before I got out of bed, on the walk home from work, in line at the\ngrocery store.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to tell myself that I\u2019m not the only one, that everyone does this too. The dopamine hit of something new prevents\nmany of us from working on our priorities. It isn\u2019t just that I was spending too much time on email, though, it\u2019s that email could hi-\njack my time from what\u2019s important. The scary thing is, I often wanted it to take me away from what I was supposed to be doing.\n\nConsider a major report I needed to complete early in my career. I would get to work and rather than write the report, which\nwas clearly the most important thing for me to do, I\u2019d check my email. If there was anything in my inbox that required even a\nmodicum of attention, I\u2019d tell myself I needed to do that before starting on the report. And, of course, by the time I was done with\nthat first email, more had come in that needed attention. It didn\u2019t take much to convince myself I needed to do that before I started.\nOnly near the end of the workday would I finally sit down to write the report, mentally exhausted.\n\nWhen you step back and think about it for a second, I was giving one of the most important things I wanted to do the worst\nof myself. Email, which I dread on the best of days, was getting my most energetic and creative self. Many of us do this with our\npartners too. By the time everything we need to do over the course of a long day is finished, we're exhausted. And this is the time\n\u2018we give to our spouse, the most important person in our lives!\n\nIf there were a recipe for accumulated disaster, it would be giving the best of ourselves to the least important things and the\nworst of ourselves to the most important things.\n\nThe path to breaking bad habits is making your desired behavior the default behavior. To get on track with the report, I told\nmy colleagues that until the report was submitted, I\u2019d buy them all lunch if they caught me with my email open before 11:00 a.m.\nMy being competitive and not wanting to buy them lunch created enough friction to keep me from checking it first thing in the\nmorning.\n\nTd work free from distraction all morning. In the afternoon, I\u2019d do email, take calls, and attend or conduct meetings. It\u2019s incred-\n\nible how much I got done.\n\f"}, "001023.png": {"text": "It\u2019s easy to underestimate the role ease plays in decision-making. Since behavior follows the path of least resistance, a surpris-\n\ningly successful approach is to add friction where you find yourself doing things you don\u2019t want to do.\n\nSafeguard Strategy 4: Putting in Guardrails\n\nAnother safeguarding strategy is to formulate operating procedures for yourself because you know from hard experience when\nyour defaults tend to override your decision-making. The defaults prevent us from seeing what\u2019s actually happening and from re-\nsponding in ways aligned with our best self-image.\n\nWe've already discussed setting automatic rules such as Kahneman\u2019s resolution to not say yes to things on the phone, and\navoiding making important decisions under unfavorable conditions. There are other effective safeguarding procedures, though,\nthat also force you to slow down in the moment, creating a pocket of time in which to think more clearly about any situation.\nThese procedures make us take a step back and ask, \u201cWhat am I trying to achieve?\u201d and \u201cIs this moving me closer to that or further\naway?\u201d These seem like basic questions, but they\u2019re often forgotten in the heat of the moment.\n\nChecklists, for instance, offer a simple way to override your defaults. Pilots go through a preflight checklist every time they fly.\nSurgeons go through preoperative checklists every time they operate. You might have a packing checklist every time you travel. In\neach of these cases, the checklist acts as a safeguard, forcing us to slow down whatever we're doing and go back to basics: \u201cWhat\nam I trying to accomplish? And what are the things I need to accomplish it?\u201d Questions like these are the guardrails that will keep\n\nyou on the road to success.2&\n\nSafeguard Strategy 5: Shifting Your Perspective\n\nEach of us sees things only from a particular point of view. Nobody can possibly see everything. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that\n\nwe can\u2019t shift the way we see things in any given situation.\n\f"}, "001024.png": {"text": "In physics, a frame of reference is a set of coordinates for observing events. Different observers occupy different frames of ref-\nerence, and what\u2019s visible from one isn\u2019t necessarily visible from another. For example, you occupy one frame of reference if you're\nseated in a traveling train car, while I occupy a different one if I\u2019m standing at the station, watching your train pass by. Within your\nframe of reference, you and the bench on which you're sitting are stationary. From mine, though, you and the bench are both mov-\ning fast.\n\nImagine now that it were possible for you to shift your frame of reference. What if, for instance, I were live streaming the\napproach of your train to you? You would then be able to see yourself and your position from my perspective, giving you more\ninformation about your situation that wasn\u2019t visible from your frame of reference. Suppose your train were on a collision course\nwith an obstacle on the tracks ahead that was only visible from my frame of reference. Within your view, everything would seem\nfine. You wouldn't know you were headed toward disaster. Shifting your frame of reference and seeing things from my perspective\nwould give you crucial information and enable you to take steps to avoid a catastrophe.\n\nWhat applies in the train example applies to many other cases. While you might be seated on your couch reading this book and\nnot moving at all, from the sun\u2019s point of view, you're moving at sixty-seven thousand miles per hour around it. Having an outside\nperspective on your situation allows you to see more of what\u2019s actually happening. Changing your perspective changes what you\nsee.\n\nShifting your frame of reference is a powerful safeguard against blind spots. Earlier, we saw that Michael Abrashoff was able\nto turn around the performance of the USS Benfold by shifting his frame of reference. Rather than continuing to see things from\nthe Benfold\u2019s established frame of reference\u2014a frame in which it was normal for officers to treat sailors as second-class citizens\n\u2014Abrashoff shifted his frame of reference and looked at things instead from the perspective of ordinary sailors and ordinary\nfairness.\n\nTonce had a coworker who was also a friend. One day he walked into my office with some news. \u201cI figured out what I\u2019m doing\n\nwrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so busy trying to prove to everyone I\u2019m right that I can\u2019t see the world from their point of view.\u201d\n\f"}, "001025.png": {"text": "The problem wasn\u2019t that he wasn\u2019t smart. He was. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t work hard. He did. The problem was that he couldn\u2019t\nrelate to other people because he hadn't even made any effort to see things through their eyes. Now he\u2019d come to realize it himself\nand started to change his behavior.\n\nFrom that point on, whenever he discussed something with anyone at work, he would start by offering his impressions of how\nthe other person saw things. Then he would ask, \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d\n\nAsking this question is a clever move. It implies that he\u2019s open to correction and gives the other person a chance to correct him.\nOne of the deepest-rooted human instincts is to correct other people, so by asking this question, he makes it easy for the other\nperson to engage with him. Then, if the other person does in fact correct him, it reveals to him which factors are most important to\nthat person.\n\nWhen the other person is done answering that first question, my friend still doesn\u2019t offer his own thoughts right away. He first\nasks a follow-up: \u201cWhat else did I miss?\u201d\n\nThis approach to interpersonal communication is an example of a reference-shifting safeguard. Asking the two questions, and\nlistening to the answers people give him, forces him to see things through other people's eyes. Taking the time to do that protects\nhim against a tendency that he identified as a weakness.\n\nA few months after making the change, he became a conduit between his team and the rest of the organization. As time\nwent on, people started asking that he accompany his boss to meetings. When his boss eventually moved to a new role, everyone\n\nwanted him to fill the vacancy.

EVEN THE most skilled people make mistakes, because there are so many factors beyond our\nknowledge and control that impact our success.

When you repeatedly don\u2019t get the\noutcomes you want, though, the world is telling you to update your understanding.\n\nMany people don\u2019t want to hear that their ideas are wrong. They don\u2019t want to be conscious of the flaws in their thinking and\nwould prefer instead to sleepwalk through life. They do this in part because recognizing that their ideas are wrong is a blow to\ntheir self-image: it\u2019s proof that they\u2019re not as smart or knowledgeable as they\u2019ve believed themselves to be.

More than a few of us choose the latter.\n\nThe biggest mistake people make typically isn\u2019t their initial mistake. It\u2019s the mistake of trying to cover up and avoid responsi-\nbility for it. The first mistake is expensive; the second one costs a fortune.\n\nMy kids learned this the hard way. One day, I came home to find a weird piece of broken glass on the floor. I held it up and asked\nwhat had happened, and they pleaded ignorance. When I opened the garbage, though, and moved a sheet of paper that seemed\nto have been carefully placed on top, I found the remains of a shattered vase. I gave my kids one final opportunity to change their\nstory. With all the confidence preteens could muster, they stuck to it. When the consequences came, it wasn\u2019t for breaking the\nvase, it was for lying.\n\nThere are three problems with covering up mistakes. The first is that you can\u2019t learn if you ignore your mistakes. The second is\nthat hiding them becomes a habit. The third is that the cover-up makes a bad situation worse.\n\nAdmitting error and correcting course is a time-saver that empowers you to avoid making more mistakes in the future. How-\never, mistakes also provide rare opportunities for getting closer to the kind of person you want to be, should you choose to heed\ntheir lessons. Use those opportunities wisely! Don\u2019t squander them.\n\nThe four steps to handling mistakes more effectively are as follows: (1) accept responsibility, (2) learn from the mistake, (3)\n\ncommit to doing better, and (4) repair the damage as best you can.\n\nStep 1: Accept Responsibility\n\nIf you've taken command of your life, you need to acknowledge any contribution you\u2019ve made to a mistake and take responsibility\n\f"}, "001029.png": {"text": "for what happens afterward. Even if the mistake isn\u2019t entirely your fault, it\u2019s still your problem, and you still have a role to play in\nhandling it.\n\nWhen mistakes happen, the emotion default works hard to usurp control over the situation. It will take over if you let it. This\nis the opposite of taking command, leaving your life\u2019s direction up to an emotional whim. It\u2019s essential to keep your emotions in\ncheck. If you haven\u2019t worked on building that strength, then there\u2019s not much you can do. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to practice\n\ncontinually.\n\nStep 2: Learn from the Mistake\n\nTake time to reflect on what you contributed to the mistake, by exploring the various thoughts, feelings, and actions that got you\nhere. If it\u2019s an emergency, and you don\u2019t have time to reflect at the moment, be sure to come back to it. If you don\u2019t identify the\nproblem\u2019s causes, after all, you can\u2019t fix them. And if you can\u2019t fix them, you can\u2019t do better in the future. Instead, you'll be doomed.\nto repeat the same mistake over and over.\n\nIf you reach this stage and you find yourself blaming other people or saying things like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair!\u201d or \u201cWhy did this hap-\n\npen to me?\u201d then you haven't accepted responsibility for the mistake. You need to go back to Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Commit to Doing Better\n\nFormulate a plan for doing better in the future. It could be a matter of building a strength like greater self-accountability or greater\nself-confidence. Or it could be a matter of installing a safeguard like my friend and coworker did when he realized he\u2019d been fail-\ning to see things from other people\u2019s points of view. Either way, you need to make a plan for doing better in the future, and follow\n\nthrough on that plan. Only then will you be able to change how you do things, and avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.\n\f"}, "001030.png": {"text": "Step 4: Repair the Damage as Best You Can\n\nMost times it\u2019s possible to repair the damage caused by a mistake. The longer your relationship with a person and the more consis-\ntent your behavior has been, the easier it is to repair. That doesn\u2019t mean it happens instantly, though. Just as it takes a while for a\nwound to heal, it takes a while for a relationship to heal. It\u2019s not enough to accept the impact of your behavior and sincerely apolo-\ngize. You need to be consistent in doing better going forward. Any immediate deviation quickly reverses any repair.\n\nNot all mistakes are like this. Some mistakes have consequences that are irreversible. The key here is not letting a bad situation\nbecome a worse situation.\n\nA friend of mine is the general manager of a major sports team. When talking about mistakes, he told me about a mentor of his\nwho had made a \u201cbad trade\u201d based on impulse, not reason. After the paperwork was signed, he couldn't take it back. His mentor\nknew it was a mistake before the player suited up for their first game. His inner voice, the inner saboteur we all have, told him he\nwas an imposter and now the whole world knew it. It told him he was an idiot. That little voice undid years of exceptional player\nmanagement, eroding his confidence and paralyzing him, rendering him unable to make effective decisions under uncertainty. He\nkept thinking that gathering more data would help him remove uncertainty. It wasn\u2019t long before he lost his job.\n\nMistakes turn into anchors if you don\u2019t accept them. Part of accepting them is learning from them and then letting them go.\n\u2018We can\u2019t change the past, but we can work to undo the effects it\u2019s had on the future.\n\nThe most powerful story in the world is the one you tell yourself. That inner voice has the power to move you forward or an-\n\nchor you to the past. Choose wisely.\n\f"}, "001031.png": {"text": "PART 4\n\nDECISIONS: CLEAR THINKING IN ACTION\n\nIf you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.\n\n\u2014NEIL PEART\n\f"}, "001032.png": {"text": "ONCE YOU HAVE reprogrammed your defaults to create space for clear thinking, you must master the skill of decision-\nmaking.\n\nDecisions are different from choices. If you casually select an option from a range of alternatives, you've made a choice.\nIf you react without thinking, you've made an unconscious choice. But neither of these is the same as a decision. A decision is\n\na choice that involves conscious thought.\n\nThe decision = the judgment that a certain option is the best one\n\nOften what seems like poor judgment in hindsight doesn\u2019t even register as a decision in the moment. When the defaults\nconspire, we react without thinking. And that reaction doesn\u2019t even count as a decision. Once we register the opportunity to\nmake a conscious choice, the question becomes: How can we make the best decision possible?\n\nThe decision itself should represent the outcome of the decision-making process. That process is about weighing your\noptions with the aim of selecting the best one, and it\u2019s composed of four stages: defining the problem, exploring possible\nsolutions, evaluating the options, and finally making the judgment and executing the best option.

Sometimes adults do too. Perhaps it's because we\nhave to make a choice so quickly that we don't have time to evaluate the options. Or maybe it's because we let habit choose\nfor us, the inertia of past choices carrying us through the present moment without exploring our options. Or maybe it\u2019s just\nthat we let our emotions make choices without even realizing it\u2014momentary anger, fear, or desire preempting evaluation\nand pushing us to act without thinking or reason.\n\nNone of these examples count as decisions. That doesn\u2019t mean we're not responsible for them. We are! It simply means\nwe're not reasoning. We're not consciously thinking. Instead, we're reacting, and giving up our deciding moment to our\ndefaults. It\u2019s in these moments that we often do something contrary to what we'd decide is best if we reasoned instead of\nreacted. When we react without reason, we cause more problems than we solve. If only we had the hindsight of our future\nselves as our foresight now!\n\nNot every bad decision is rushed, nor is every good one made slowly. It\u2019s not that simple.\n\nPeople mistake choosing for decisiveness and the decision-making process for waffling. Part of what makes slowing\ndown and reasoning through a problem difficult is that, to the outside observer, it might look like inaction. But inaction is a\nchoice.\n\nWhen the stakes are low, inaction hurts you more than speed. Sometimes it's better just to make a quick choice and not\nspend time deliberating. Why waste time evaluating if an action is inconsequential and its effects are easily reversed? For\nexample, if there are two identical squat racks in the gym and both are momentarily open, it makes no difference which one\nyou take. If you wait and decide, they'll both be taken by someone else. Just choose either one.\n\nWhen the stakes are higher, though, speed can hurt you.

Otherwise, you end up solving the wrong problems. As the old adage says, \u201cIf the only tool you have is a hammer,\nyou tend to see every problem as a nail.\u201d\n\nKnowing how to use these tools depends on keeping your defaults in check so you can reason. If you can't, you'll just\nreact with one of your defaults. While you might get the outcomes you desire for a while, it's only a matter of time before\nlack of thinking catches up to you. It's only after you've mastered the defaults that the tools | describe become useful.\n\nIf you can\u2019t keep those in check\u2014if you're easily swayed by emotion, if you can't adapt to change, if you value being\nright more than doing what's best\u2014then all the tools in the world aren't going to help you.

If you\u2019re not the one making the decision, you\ncan suggest the problem that needs to be solved, but you don\u2019t get to define it. Only the person responsible for the outcome does.\nThe decision-maker can take input from anywhere\u2014bosses, subordinates, colleagues, experts, etc. However, the responsibility to\nget to the bottom of the problem\u2014to sort fact from opinion and determine what's really happening\u2014rests with them.\n\nDefining the problem starts with identifying two things: (1) what you want to achieve, and (2) what obstacles stand in the way\nof getting it.\n\nUnfortunately, people too often end up solving the wrong problem.\n\nPerhaps you can relate to this scenario, which I\u2019ve seen thousands of times over the years. A decision-maker assembles a\ndiverse team to solve a critical and time-sensitive problem. There are ten people in the room all giving input about what\u2019s happen-\ning\u2014each from a different perspective. Within a few minutes someone announces what they think the problem is, the room goes\n\nsilent for a microsecond ... and then everyone starts discussing possible solutions.\n\f"}, "001037.png": {"text": "Often the first plausible description of the situation defines the problem that the team will try to solve.\u21222 Once the group\ncomes up with a solution, the decision-maker feels good. That person then allocates resources toward the idea and expects the\nproblem to be solved. But it isn\u2019t. Because the first lens into an issue rarely reveals what the real problem is, so the real problem\ndoesn\u2019t get solved.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening here?\n\nThe social default prompts us to accept the first definition people agree on and move forward. Once someone states a problem,\nthe team shifts into \u201csolution\u201d mode without considering whether the problem has even been correctly defined. This is what hap-\npens when you put a bunch of smart, type A people together and tell them to solve a problem. Most of the time, they end up miss-\ning the real problem and merely addressing a symptom of it. They react without reasoning.\n\nMany of us have been taught that solving problems is how we add value. In school, teachers give us problems to solve, and at\nwork our bosses do the same. We've been taught our whole lives to solve problems.\n\nBut when it comes to defining problems, we have less experience. Things are often uncertain. We seldom have all the informa-\ntion. Sometimes, there are competing ideas about what the problem is, competing proposals to solve it, and then lots of interper-\nsonal friction. So we\u2019re much less comfortable defining problems than solving them, and the social default uses that discomfort. It\nencourages us to react instead of reason, in order to prove we're adding value. Just solve a problem\u2014any problem!\n\nThe result: organizations and individuals waste a lot of time solving the wrong problems. It\u2019s so much easier to treat the\nsymptoms than find the underlying disease, to put out fires rather than prevent them, or to simply punt things into the future.\nThe problem with this approach is that the fires never burn out, they flare up repeatedly. And when you punt something into the\nfuture, the future eventually arrives.\n\nWe're busier than ever at work, but most of the time what we're busy doing is putting out fires\u2014fires that started with a poor\n\ninitial decision made years earlier, which should\u2019ve been prevented in the first place.\n\f"}, "001038.png": {"text": "And because there are so many fires and so many demands on our time, we tend to focus on just putting out the flames. Yet as\nany experienced camper knows, putting out flames doesn\u2019t put out the fire. Since all our time is spent running around and putting\nout the flames, we have no time to think about today\u2019s problems, which can create the kindling for tomorrow\u2019 fires.\n\nThe best decision-makers know that the way we define a problem shapes everyone's perspective about it and determines the\nsolutions. The most critical step in any decision-making process is to get the problem right. This part of the process offers invalu-\nable insight. Since you can't solve a problem you don\u2019t understand, defining the problem is a chance to take in lots of relevant infor-\nmation. Only by talking to the experts, seeking the opinions of others, hearing their different perspectives, and sorting out what\u2019s\nreal from what\u2019s not can the decision-maker understand the real problem.\n\nWhen you really understand a problem, the solution seems obvious. Later, we'll talk about the tells that reveal when people are\nsolving a problem they don\u2019t fully understand.\n\nThese two principles follow the example of the best decision-makers:\n\nTHE DEFINITION PRINCIPLE: Take responsibility for defining the problem. Don't let someone define it for you. Do the work to under-\n\nstand it. Don't use jargon to describe or explain it.\n\nTHE ROOT CAUSE PRINCIPLE: Identify the root cause of the problem. Don't be content with simply treating its symptoms.\n\nIonce took over a department where the software would regularly freeze. Solving the problem required physically rebooting the\nserver. (The drawback of working in a top secret facility was our lack of connectivity to the outside world.)\nAlmost every weekend, one of the people on my team would be called into work to fix the problem. Without fail, he\u2019d have the\n\nsystem back up and running quickly. The outage was small, the impact minimal. Problem solved.

We were\naddressing the symptom without solving the problem. Fixing the real problem required a few weeks of work, instead of a few min-\n\u2018utes on the weekend. No one wanted to solve the real problem because it was painful. So we just kept putting out flames and letting\nthe fire reignite.\n\nA handy tool for identifying the root cause of a problem is to ask yourself, \u201cWhat would have to be true for this problem not to\nexist in the first place?\u201d Here\u2019s another example of this tool put to use:\n\nThe ASPCA is one of the largest animal-welfare groups in the United States. It estimates that more than 3 million dogs enter\nshelters each year and are put up for adoption. Roughly 1.4 million of them are successfully adopted, but that leaves more than 1\nmillion unadopted dogs in the US each year.\u21222\n\nThere are only so many people willing to adopt a pet, and only so many pets a given family can handle, so the question facing\nmost shelters is, \u201cHow can we get more people to adopt?\u201d But answering that question doesn\u2019t make any progress toward a long-\nterm solution.\n\nOne shelter took a different approach. The founder of Downtown Dog Rescue in Los Angeles, Lori Weise, asked instead, \u201cWhat\nwould have to be true for there to be fewer dogs to adopt in the first place?\u201d!. Weise dug into the data and found that 30 percent\nof dogs entering a shelter were owner surrenders\u2014pets voluntarily given up by their owners. She found that many times caring\nowners surrendered their pets because they couldn\u2019t afford to feed them and thought someone else could better care for the ani-\nmal. With this insight, a better and more permanent solution became apparent.\n\nWeise started a new program: Whenever a family came in to surrender a pet, the staff asked if they would prefer to keep the\npet. If the answer was yes, the staff used their network to help resolve the problem\u2014whether it was just a matter of a ten-dollar\nrabies shot, or long-term access to pet food. Weise and her team found that it was actually cheaper to help a family feed and keep a\npet than to house it at the shelter. More important, the program enabled 75 percent of the families who came in intending to sur-\n\nrender pets to keep them permanently instead.\n\f"}, "001040.png": {"text": "Identifying the root cause of a problem applies in business too. A company might think that its problem is getting too few new\nsales, so it marshals resources to get new leads. But what if getting new sales isn\u2019t the root of the problem? What if there's an issue\nwith, say, the product itself? The root cause of any problem like this is customer satisfaction, and that\u2019s not necessarily the same as\ngetting new customers. It could also be keeping existing customers happy. The way you define a problem changes what you see.\n\nYour defaults are always present, and despite your efforts to follow the Definition Principle and the Root Cause Principle, it\u2019s\n\nstill possible to get sidetracked.\n\nHow to Safeguard the Problem-Defining Stage\n\nThere are two ways to safeguard this stage of the decision process against our defaults: create a firewall and use time to your\n\nadvantage.\n\nsareGuaro: Build a problem-solution firewall. Separate the problem-defining phase of the decision-making process from the prob-\n\nlem-solving phase.\n\nAmentor of mine once taught me that the best way to avoid finding the perfect solution to the wrong problem at work, when time\nallows, is to hold two separate meetings: one to define the problem, and one to come up with the solution.\n\nThe most precious resources in any organization are time and the brainpower of your best employees. Asking for two separate\nmeetings to come up with a solution to a problem that seemed obvious to everyone is not an easy sell. But it\u2019s worth it. I\u2019ve used\nthis safeguard for many years, and I\u2019ve seen it used over and over by people who consistently make good decisions. As soon as they\nstart implementing it, they learn that having a single meeting for both tasks only makes them vulnerable to the social default\u2014\n\neither their action-oriented teams will likely spend only a moment or two defining the problem and the rest of the meeting trying\n\f"}, "001041.png": {"text": "to solve it, or everyone will start suggesting solutions to their version of the problem. Either way the meeting won't be as useful as\nit should be.\n\nWhen you spend time trying to understand the problem, you realize that you have a room full of people who have insight that\nyou don\u2019t have. One way to keep meetings short and avoid the signaling that comes from repeating information that everyone\nknows is simply asking everyone, \u201cWhat do you know about this problem that other people in the room don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\nThat question makes people think. They stop filling the air with ideas everyone already knows and start explaining how they\nthink about the problem.\n\nNot only do you start learning from each other, but you come to understand the problem at a deeper level because you start\nto see (and hopefully appreciate) different perspectives. Later, when you reconvene at the second meeting, the solutions often\nbecome obvious to everyone. And because everyone understands the problem, each person knows how to move their part of the\norganization in a way that solves it for everyone, not just themselves. An apocryphal quote often attributed to the philosopher\nLudwig Wittgenstein sums up this idea: \u201cTo understand is to know what to do.\u201d\u21224\n\nPeople go fast in operational environments. If you insert too much process into decisions, you miss the expiring windows of\nopportunity. But fast-paced environments are a feast for defaults. You need to slow down\u2014but not too much\u2014and use a combi-\nnation of judgment, principles, and safeguards to make sure you're getting to the best answer possible and thinking clearly. Prob-\ning and asking deeper questions slows down the process just enough to dramatically improve your chances of solving the right\nproblem.\n\nCreating space between the definition of a problem and the solution to it works at a personal level too. Give yourself time to get\nclear on what the problem is before you jump into solving it. More often than not, you'll discover that your first attempt to define\n\nthe underlying issue is rarely the most accurate.\n\f"}, "001042.png": {"text": "tip: Remember that writing out the problem makes the invisible visible. Write down what you think the problem is, and then look\nat it the next day. If you find yourself using jargon in your description, it's a sign that you don't fully understand the problem.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t understand it, you shouldn't be making a decision about it.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to the second way of safeguarding this stage of the decision-making process.\n\nsareGuaro: Use the test of time. Test whether you're addressing the root cause of a problem, rather than merely treating a symp-\ntom, by asking yourself whether it will stand the test of time. Will this solution fix the problem permanently, or will the problem\n\nreturn in the future? If it seems like the latter, then chances are you're only treating a symptom.\n\nSuppose, for example, that Downtown Dog Rescue in Los Angeles had tried to solve its problem with overcrowding by hosting a\nspring dog-adoption campaign, rather than addressing one of the root causes: pet owners\u2019 inability to continue caring for their\ndogs. The campaign might have succeeded in reducing the number of dogs the rescue housed at the time, but only temporarily. A\nfew months later, the facility would have once again been overcrowded.\n\nShort-term solutions might make sense in the moment, but they never win in the long term. You feel like you're moving\nforward when you're actually just going in circles. People gravitate toward them because finding a short-term fix signals to others\nthat they\u2019re doing something. That\u2019s the social default at work. It fools people into mistaking action for progress, the loudest voice\nfor the right one, and confidence for competence. Time eventually reveals short-term solutions to be Band-Aids that cover deeper\nproblems. Don\u2019t be fooled!\n\nYou can put your energy into short-term solutions or long-term solutions but not both.

The point isn\u2019t to worry about problems; it\u2019s to fortify and prepare\nfor them.\n\nThe hardest setbacks to deal with are the ones we\u2019re not prepared for and don\u2019t expect. That\u2019s why you need to anticipate them\nbefore they happen and act now in order to avoid them.\n\nMany people think they\u2019re bad problem solvers when in fact they\u2019re bad problem anticipators. Most of us don\u2019t want to think\nabout more problems; we have enough already. We think that before bad things happen, we'll get a warning, we'll have time to pre-\npare, we'll be ready. But the world doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nBad things happen to good people all the time. We get laid off without warning. We get into a car accident. Our boss comes into\nour office and lays into us. A pandemic spreads throughout the world. No warnings. No time to prepare.\n\nPerforming a premortem might not save you from every disaster, but you'll be surprised by how many it can save you from.\n\nHere's how it works.\n\nWhat Could Go Wrong?\n\nImagining what could go wrong doesn\u2019t make you pessimistic. It makes you prepared. If you haven\u2019t thought about the things that\ncould go wrong, you will be at the mercy of circumstances. Fear, anger, panic\u2014when emotion consumes you, reason leaves you.\nYou just react.\n\nThe antidote is this principle:\n\f"}, "001047.png": {"text": "THE BAD OUTCOME PRINCIPLE: Don't just imagine the ideal future outcome. Imagine the things that could go wrong and how you'll\n\novercome them if they do.\n\nIf you've got a presentation to the board next week, imagine all the ways it could go wrong: What if technology fails? What if they\ncan\u2019t find the presentation? What if the audience isn\u2019t engaged?\n\nLeave nothing out of consideration. Nothing should surprise you. As Seneca said, \u201cWe need to envisage every possibility and...\nstrengthen the spirit to deal with the things which may conceivably come about.\u201d2\n\nWhen bad things happen, there is no two-minute warning where you get a commercial break to prepare. You have to deal with\nit as it happens. The best decision-makers know that bad things happen, and that they\u2019re not immune. They don\u2019t just wing it and\nreact. They anticipate and make contingency plans. And because they\u2019re ready, their confidence doesn\u2019t crack. The venture capital-\nist Josh Wolfe likes to say, \u201cFailure comes from a failure to imagine failure.\u201d2\n\nThe bottom line: people who think about what\u2019s likely to go wrong and determine the actions they can take are more likely to\nsucceed when things don\u2019t go according to plan.\n\nAsmart way to assess your options is by using the following principle.\n\n\u2018THE SECOND-LEVEL THINKING PRINCIPLE: Ask yourself, \u201cAnd then what?\u201d\n\nWhen you solve a problem, you make a change in the world. That change can be either in line with your long-term objectives or\nnot. For example, if you're hungry and you eat a chocolate bar, you've solved the immediate hunger problem, but that solution\nhas consequences: the inevitable sugar crash an hour or two later. If your longer-term goal is to be productive that afternoon, the\n\nchocolate bar is not the best solution to your immediate problem.\n\f"}, "001048.png": {"text": "It\u2019s true that eating a chocolate bar once won\u2019t ruin your diet or your day. But repeating that seemingly small error in judgment\ndaily over the course of your lifetime will not put you in a position for success. Tiny choices compound. That\u2019s why second-level\n\nthinking is needed.\n\nSecond-Level Thinking\n\nInside us all, there is a competition between our today self and our future self.@! Our future self often wants us to make different\nchoices than our today self wants to make. While today you cares about winning the present moment, future you cares about\nwinning the generation. Each of these personalities offers a different perspective on problems. Our future self sees the benefits or\nconsequences of the accumulation of our seemingly insignificant choices.\n\nYou can think of first-level thinking as your today self and second-level thinking as your future self.\n\nFirst-level thinking looks to solve the immediate problem without regard to any future problems a solution might produce.\nSecond-level thinking looks at the problem from beginning to end. It looks past the immediate solution and asks, \u201cAnd then\nwhat?\u201d\u21222 The chocolate bar doesn\u2019t seem so tempting when you answer this question.\n\nYou can\u2019t solve a problem optimally unless you consider not just whether it meets your short-term objectives but whether it\nmeets your long-term objectives as well. A failure to think of second-order consequences leads us unknowingly to make bad deci-\nsions. You can\u2019t ensure the future is easier if you only think about solving the current problem and don\u2019t give due consideration to\nthe problems created in the process. This idea is evident when looking back at the US war in Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to a report issued by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction,\n\nMany of the institutions and infrastructure projects the United States built were not sustainable .... Every mile of road\nthe United States built and every government employee it trained was thought to serve as a springboard for even more\n\nimprovements and to enable the reconstruction effort to eventually end.

Ideally, she wants to work for a company committed to social responsibility.\nShe has $100k in the bank, and wants to have a job within two years, but can wait as long as four. She currently has two job offers\nfor less money than she wants, and neither job excites her very much. She\u2019s considering going back to school for her master\u2019s in the\nhopes that it\u2019ll open up more employment options, but she knows she won't be able to do schoolwork while holding a full-time po-\nsition and still have time for her family.\n\nLet\u2019s now consider some possible solutions. Maria\u2019s options include:\n\n+ Going back to school for a master\u2019s degree\n+ Accepting one of the full-time positions she\u2019s been offered at $90k per year\n+ Doing some consulting work\n\n+ Continuing to look for other full-time opportunities\n\f"}, "001050.png": {"text": "Next, consider the immediate outcomes of these options:\n\n+ If Maria goes back to school, it could mean thirty-plus hours a week doing school-related things.

It won't!\n\nHow to Safeguard the Solution-Exploring Stage\n\nJust because you've thought of a couple solutions, though, doesn\u2019t mean you've eliminated your blind spots. Binary thinking is\nwhen you consider only two options to a problem. When you first look at the choice, it seems simple: We launch the product or\nwe don\u2019t. We take the new job or we don\u2019t. We get married or we don't. It\u2019s black and white: \u201cdo\u201d or \u201cdo not.\u201d There isn\u2019t any middle\n\nground.\n\f"}, "001053.png": {"text": "Most of the time, though, this type of thinking is limiting. Some decisions might seem to come down to a choice between this\nor that, but there\u2019s often another option. The best decision-makers know this, and see binary thinking as a sign that we don\u2019t fully\nunderstand a problem\u2014that we're trying to reduce the problem\u2019s dimensions before fully understanding them.\n\nWhen we start exploring a problem in detail, things become more complicated before we understand it well enough to see the\nalternatives.\n\nProblem-solving novices try to reduce a decision to just two options because it creates the false sense that they\u2019ve gotten to the\nproblem\u2019s essence. In reality, they\u2019ve just stopped thinking. And you never want to stop thinking! Novices fail to see the complexi-\nties of a problem that are apparent to a master. Masters see the simplicity hiding in the complexity. As Frederic Maitland purport-\nedly once wrote, \u201cSimplicity is the end result of long, hard work, not the starting point.\u201d When we reduce the problem to black-\nand-white solutions, we need to check to make sure we're the master and not the novice.\n\nThis brings us to the next principle of effective problem-solving:\n\nTHE 3+ PRINCIPLE: Force yourself to explore at least three possible solutions to a problem. If you find yourself considering only two\n\noptions, force yourself to find at least one more.\n\nBinary framing is as comfortable as it is passive. Doing the work to add a third option forces us to be creative and really dig into the\nproblem. Even if we don\u2019t choose the third option, forcing ourselves to develop it helps us understand the problem better. It gives\n\u2018us more opportunities to align our decisions with our goals, offers more optionality in the future, and increases the chances that\nwe'll be happier with our decision down the road.\n\nThere are two safeguards against binary thinking. The first is this:\n\f"}, "001054.png": {"text": "saFEGuARD: Imagine that one of the options is off the table. Take each of the options you're considering, and one at a time, ask\n\nyourself, \u201cWhat would | do if that were not possible?\u201d\n\nSuppose you're considering what to do about a job where you don\u2019t get along with a coworker. Binary thinking tells you to stay or\nleave. Imagining that one option is off the table forces you to see the problem differently. Imagine that, for some reason, there is\nabsolutely no way to quit your job: You must stay. Now you are forced to see things through a new lens. What could you do to make\ngoing to work every day more enjoyable, despite the problem with your coworker? What could you do to remain at your job and\nstill move closer to your goals? What could you do to give yourself more options in the future so you're not stuck feeling powerless?\nMaybe staying means having a hard conversation with your boss and your coworker that you haven't had yet. Maybe it means\nputting in for a transfer to another department. Maybe it means asking your boss if you can work remotely.\n\nNow try looking at this situation the other way. Imagine that, for some reason, there is absolutely no way you can stay at your\njob: You have to leave. What would you do? Would you call up old clients and see if they need help? Would you get hold of people\nin your network to see if they could make an introduction at their company? Would you pursue every possibility until you found\nyourself in a better position?\n\nSometimes we can\u2019t do what we want when we want, like leaving a job that\u2019s become difficult to endure. But that doesn\u2019t mean\nwe're stuck. We can always do something to move forward, putting ourselves in a better position to get more of what we want and\nless of what we don't. If we can\u2019t leave our job, we can at least improve it. If we can\u2019t stay, we can prepare to leave. Reframing the\nproblem shows us the next step.\n\nRemember: Limiting ourselves to binary thinking before fully understanding a problem is a dangerous simplification that\ncreates blind spots. False dualities prevent you from seeing alternative paths and other information that might change your mind.\n\nOn the other hand, taking away one of two clear options forces you to reframe the problem and get unstuck.\n\f"}, "001055.png": {"text": "Here\u2019s the second safeguard against binary thinking:\n\nSAFEGUARD: Come up with Both-And options. Try to find ways of combining the binary. Think not in terms of choosing either X or Y,\n\nbut rather having both X and Y.\n\nRoger Martin, former dean of the Rotman School of Management in Toronto, refers to this technique as integrative thinking.>\nRather than grappling with seemingly opposed binary options, combine them. Simplistic Either-Or options become integrative\nBoth-And options. You can keep costs down and invest in a better customer experience. You can stay at your job and start a side\nhustle. You can deliver for your shareholders and protect the environment.\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald once said, \u201cThe test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same\ntime, and still retain the ability to function. One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined\nto make them otherwise.\u201d\n\nUnlike Fitzgerald, though, I don\u2019t think you need to have first-rate intelligence to come up with Both-And options. The\ncapacity for combinatorial solutions isn\u2019t reserved for the gifted. It\u2019s a skill that can be learned and used; it\u2019s just a skill that goes\nuntaught. The key is learning to live with the uncomfortable tension between opposing ideas long enough to see that there\u2019s a so-\nlution that combines the best elements of both. And that\u2019s what integrative thinking is all about.\n\nIt can be challenging to think this way, yet it\u2019s almost always possible. One area where we tend to be pretty good at integrative\nthinking is vacation planning. We ask everyone involved what they want to do, and then try to find a place that has it all. This is\nwhy resorts or cruises offer a long list of activities: the more variety, the more attractive they are to groups with diverse interests.\nGuests in such places rarely face a hard choice between, say, the beach or the pool. They can have both.\n\nYou can apply the same thinking to other areas of your life, including your career. The solution to an unfulfilling job is rarely\n\njust one option in the stay-or-go binary, even if it seems that way at first. You can both stay and begin reaching out to your network.\n\f"}, "001056.png": {"text": "You can both apply for jobs and go to school in the evenings to acquire a new skill. You can both start a creative project and do more\nat your current job to give you the creative outlet you need.\n\nRoger Martin put it this way: \u201cThinkers who exploit opposing ideas to construct a new solution enjoy a built-in advantage over\nthinkers who can consider only one model at a time.\u201d He\u2019s right. Not only do integrative thinkers build an advantage, they also tend\nto capture exponential upside because they break free of traditional ways of thinking.\n\nConsider Isadore Sharp, who created the luxurious Four Seasons hotel chain. Sharp\u2019s first property was a small roadside hotel\nin the Toronto suburbs. His second was a large convention hotel in the heart of the city. Each property represented one of the con-\nventional operating models of the time: either going small and focusing on personal service or going large and focusing on ameni-\nties. The hotel industry was stuck in binary thinking. Rather than choose between them, though, Sharp combined the intimacy\nof a small hotel with the amenities of a large one. In the process he created a new way of operating and one of the most successful\nhotel chains of all time.\n\nOur personal lives also benefit from Both-And thinking. For example, we often expect our partners to fulfill 100 percent of\nour emotional needs. That\u2019s a lot to ask of anyone, and many of us experience relationship challenges when disappointments\ninevitably result. But instead of asking, \u201cShould I stay or leave?\u201d ask instead, \u201cIs there anyone else that could meet some of the emo-\ntional needs that my partner can\u2019t? Is there a colleague that I could vent to at work? Do I have a friend who shares this interest or\nwho will take this class with me?\u201d\n\nWhen we think of adding people to our lives, we start to open up Both-And options for ourselves. So instead of the usual rela-\ntionship binary, \u201cShould I stay or leave?\u201d we start to say, \u201cWhom else can I include in my life to help with everything beyond what\nmy partner does well?\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t need a lot of additional options, just a few really good ones. When you hear yourself say, \u201cEither X or Y,\u201d it means\nyou're entering the narrow pathway between a rock and a hard place\u2014a binary decision. Digging in and forcing yourself to add\n\ncredible alternative options allows you to see solutions you may not have considered before.\n\f"}, "001057.png": {"text": "Opportunity Costs\n\nThinking better isn\u2019t about filling your brain with answers to questions you've seen before. It\u2019s not about memorizing what to do\nand when. It\u2019s not about letting other people think for you either. It\u2019s about looking beyond the things that are obvious and seeing\nthe things that are hidden from view.\n\nThe real world is full of trade-offs, some of which are obvious, and others that are hidden. Opportunity costs are the hidden\ntrade-offs that decision-makers often have trouble assessing. Every decision has at least one of them. Because we can\u2019t always do\neverything we want, picking one thing usually means forgoing another. The ability to size up hidden trade-offs is part of what sep-\narates great decision-makers from the rest. It\u2019s also a core element of leadership.\n\nCharlie Munger put it this way: \u201cIntelligent people make decisions based on opportunity costs ... it\u2019s your alternatives that\nmatter. That\u2019s how we make all of our decisions.\u201d>\n\nImproving our thinking isn\u2019t just about having the answers to questions we\u2019ve encountered before.

It\u2019s about delving deeper, beyond the sur-\nface level, and uncovering what lies hidden from our view.\n\nMany people focus solely on what they stand to gain by choosing an option and forget to factor in what they stand to lose by\nforgoing another. But the ability to size up these costs is one of the things that separates great decision-makers from the rest.\n\nOne of my favorite examples of this is a story about Andrew Carnegie. When Carnegie was young and relatively inexperienced\nin his job at the Pennsylvania Railroad, there was a bad train wreck that left train cars strewn across the tracks and gridlocked the\nentire system. Carnegie\u2019s boss was absent, so Carnegie himself had to decide how to handle the event. Cleaning up the cars would\nsave much of the cargo, but it would be a long and costly operation and would suspend all train traffic for days. Carnegie realized\n\nthat a multiday system-wide shutdown wasn\u2019t worth the cost of the cargo and the cars. He sent a bold note signed in his boss\u2019s\n\f"}, "001058.png": {"text": "name: \u201cBurn the cars!\u201d When Carnegie\u2019s boss learned of his choice, he instantly made it the routine method of dealing with similar\nemergencies in the future.2\n\nThinking through opportunity costs is one of the most effective things you can do in business and in life. The optimal way of\nexploring your options is to take all the relevant factors into account. You can\u2019t do this without considering opportunity costs.\n\nThere are two principles concerning opportunity costs. The first is this:\n\nTHE OPPORTUNITY-COST PRINCIPLE: Consider what opportunities you're forgoing when you choose one option over another.\n\nThe second principle is closely related:\n\nTHE 3-LENS PRINCIPLE: View opportunity costs through these three lenses: (1) Compared with what? (2) And then what? (3) At the\n\nexpense of what?\u2122\n\nFor most of us, the first lens is our default because the costs are direct and visible. For instance, think about purchasing a car. If\nyou're like most people, you can narrow the decision down to a few options pretty quickly: \u201cThe Tesla will look extra cool and be\nfuel efficient, but will it be good for road trips? A BMW looks great and has more cargo space, but is a gas-powered vehicle behind\nthe curve? Should I get the car that\u2019s $42,000 or $37,000?\u201d When we compare the two models, we focus on what the additional\n$5,000 gets us in terms of features, and forget to view the choice through the other two lenses.\n\nWhen we view the choice through the second lens, we consider the additional costs that will arise after we've selected an\noption\u2014for example, how we'll need to charge the Tesla, its anticipated yearly operating costs, its durability, and how many long\ndrives we'll go on annually. When we view the choice through the third lens, we consider what else we could do with that $5,000.\n\nAre we giving up a family vacation? What about the dividends we could get if we invested it? What about the savings if we pay\n\f"}, "001059.png": {"text": "down the mortgage? What about a rainy-day fund in case we lose our job? Looking through all three lenses helps us make a better\ndecision.\n\nMoney is not the only opportunity cost to consider. It\u2019s just the most direct and visible, and for that reason people tend to focus\nonit. They convince themselves that what's easy to see is all that matters. But in many cases, the real value to thinking through op-\nportunity costs is to understand the indirect hidden costs.\n\nTime is not as easy to see as money but it\u2019s just as important. Suppose your family is growing, and it\u2019s time to move. Relocating\nto the suburbs will get you a bigger house with a bigger yard for the kids, and it\u2019ll be cheaper than buying a smaller duplex down-\ntown with a backyard the size of a postage stamp. In this situation, many people think of how much money they\u2019ll save by moving\nto the suburbs, and get caught up in the happy thought of walking across the threshold of their new home for the first time. But\nthis way of thinking views the situation through only the first lens. It doesn\u2019t disclose the less obvious costs of living in the sub-\nurbs. When we apply the other two lenses, we start seeing those costs more clearly.\n\nLet\u2019s apply the second lens. Suppose you buy that house in the suburbs. Ask yourself, \u201cAnd then what?\u201d How will your circum-\nstances change if you choose that option? For one thing, your commute might be different. Perhaps it goes from a predictable half\nhour each way to an unpredictable hour and a half.\n\nNow apply the third lens. Ask yourself, \u201cAt the expense of what?\u201d What are you not going to be able to do because you're spend-\ning an extra two to three hours a day in transit? Will you spend less time with your kids and your partner? What will you miss\nout on by not being with them? Will you be able to spend the commute learning a new language or reading some great literature,\nor will you have to deal with the frustration and stress of driving? Over time, which option is better for your mental and physical\nhealth?\n\f"}, "001060.png": {"text": "tip: If you're having trouble assessing opportunity costs, it sometimes helps to put a price on them. For example, putting a price\n\non those extra two to three hours a day spent commuting will make them more visible and easier to assess.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that pricing things whose costs are difficult to assess is just a tool. Like any tool, it\u2019s useful for some jobs, but\nnot useful for all. It\u2019s an attempt to make the invisible visible. Sometimes there are important factors that you simply can\u2019t put a\nprice on without grossly distorting the trade-offs.

Some of my criteria included experience of the crew, availability, demonstrated pace\non past projects, and quality of craftmanship.\n\nIf you find yourself struggling to determine specific criteria, it\u2019s a sign either that you don\u2019t really understand the problem, or\n\nthat you don\u2019t understand the general features that criteria are supposed to have. Those features include the following:\n\f"}, "001062.png": {"text": "Clarity: The criteria should be simple, clear, and free of any jargon. Ideally, you should be able to explain them to a twelve-\n\nyear-old.\nGoal promotion: The criteria must favor only those options that achieve the desired goal.\n\nDecisiveness: The criteria must favor exactly one option; they can\u2019t result in a tie among several.\n\nCriteria that fail to satisfy these conditions often lead to decision-making errors. When criteria are too complicated, people have\ntrouble knowing how to apply them. When they are ambiguous, people have a green light to interpret them in whichever way suits\nthem. Asa result, people end up applying criteria in different ways based on what they want or how they feel at the moment. Their\ndecision-making process becomes a playground for the emotion default.\n\nWhen deciding at work, criteria that are ambiguous or jargon-laden lend themselves to endless debates as to their meaning.\n\u2018We assume that everyone has a shared understanding of what these words and phrases mean. They don\u2019t. We assume that our\nown definitions won\u2019t change. They might. What a word like \u201cstrategic\u201d means to one person is often different from what it means\nto another. As a result, ambiguous criteria rob decision-makers of their ability to distinguish who's right from who's wrong, and\nforce debates about semantics instead of which potential solution is the best.\n\nOther times the criteria don\u2019t promote the goal. This is often the social default\u2019s doing. One common example is when leaders\nmake decisions about hiring or promotion based not on someone's qualifications but on their likeable personality. Being nice is not\nthe same as being good at your job. Using niceness as a criterion in personnel decisions frequently doesn\u2019t promote the goals of the\norganization.\n\nSometimes criteria can promote the wrong goal\u2014steering a team toward what it can do soonest, perhaps, instead of what\u2019s\nbest for the company in the long run. A tragic example happened in January 1986.\n\nThe space shuttle Challenger was scheduled to take off in just a few short weeks. NASA had been trying to establish the space\n\nshuttle as a reliable way of conducting commercial and scientific missions in space, and adopted an incredibly ambitious launch\n\f"}, "001063.png": {"text": "schedule. NASA had coordinated with President Ronald Reagan to launch the shuttle the same day as his State of the Union ad-\ndress. The plan was for it to be a spectacular media event, with schools across the country lined up to receive their first science\nlessons from outer space.\n\nBut days before the launch, during a preflight meeting, engineers from Morton Thiokol, a contractor on the Challenger project,\nwere shouting and in tears. They knew that the temperatures predicted for the date of the launch were likely too cold for the shut-\ntle\u2019s O-rings to function successfully. If the O-rings failed, the result would be catastrophic. They wanted time to fix the problem\nor wait for warmer launch temperatures, and begged NASA to delay the launch. Their pleas were rejected. \u201cI am appalled by your\nrecommendation,\u201d one NASA official said. \u201cWhen do you want me to launch? Next April?\u201d said another. Most of us who lived\nthrough the \u201980s remember what happened next; the Challenger exploded seventy-three seconds after taking off. The criteria for\nthe launch date decision should obviously have been focused on promoting the goal of safety, not speed.\n\nThe inertia default can also inspire us to adopt criteria that aren\u2019t goal promoting. For example, upper management might\nfail to see that market conditions have changed. Rather than taking the time to understand the new conditions and adjust their\ncriteria accordingly, they continue using the criteria they\u2019ve used in the past even though those criteria aren't goal promoting in\nthe present.\n\nCriteria can also fail to be decisive. If they don\u2019t help you narrow the options, they\u2019re not useful. Indecisive criteria are another\nsign that you don\u2019t fully understand the problem and are operating out of fear that you'll be wrong. The social default preys on\npeople who don\u2019t want to take responsibility for outcomes or who don\u2019t have clear ideas of what they want.\n\nThink of choosing a restaurant for dinner with a group of friends. Someone will make an initial suggestion\u2014like eating Mex-\nican\u2014and inevitably someone else will say, \u201cI just had Mexican last night.\u201d Then you'll hear, \u201cWhat about salads?\u201d and someone\nwill say, \u201cI\u2019m too hungry for salad.\u201d On and on ad nauseam: people say what they don\u2019t want until the group is so hungry they pick\nwhatever is most convenient. I\u2019ve seen this situation play out the same way so often it\u2019s comical. (Pay attention the next time it\u2019s\n\nhappening to you!)\n\f"}, "001064.png": {"text": "The problem here is that in many cases, purely negative criteria aren\u2019t decisive: they don\u2019t narrow the field of options down to\none. As a result, people end up leaving the ultimate choice up to chance or circumstance. As the old saying goes, \u201cIf you don\u2019t know\nwhere you want to go, any road will take you there.\u201d\n\nSuppose, by contrast, that when you and your friends were deciding where to eat, each of you stated not what you didn\u2019t want\n\nbut rather what you did:\n\n-\u201cI want somewhere that serves salads within ten minutes\u2019 walking distance.\u201d\n-\u201cI want somewhere that serves burgers.\u201d\n\n+ \u201cTreally don\u2019t care; I just want to eat soon.\u201d\n\nMaking the decision would be much faster, and it would be more likely to get more people what they wanted.\n\nDefining the Most Important Thing\n\nNot all criteria are the same. There might be a hundred variables, but they are not equally important. When you're clear on what\u2019s\nimportant, evaluating options becomes easier. Many people are shy to pick out the most important thing because they don\u2019t want\nto be wrong.\n\nWhen you don\u2019t communicate what\u2019s most important, people are left guessing about what matters. They need you to solve the\nproblem for them. While you feel needed and important, you're also busy making all the decisions that your colleagues should be\nmaking.\n\nA lot of managers secretly enjoy being the bottleneck. They like the way it feels when their team is dependent on them. Don\u2019t\nbe fooled! This is the ego default at work, and it puts a ceiling on how far you will go. It tries to convince you that you're the best;\nthat you're so smart, so skilled, so insightful that only you can make the decisions. In reality, you're just getting in the way of the\n\nteam performing at its best.\n\f"}, "001065.png": {"text": "Tlearned this lesson the hard way. I had just taken over a team and was surprised that they would check in with me before\nmaking any decisions\u2014a pattern their previous manager had established.\n\nTo speed things up, I came up with a system for them to sort decisions into three boxes:\n\n1. decisions they could make without any input from me,\n2. decisions they could make after sharing their reasoning with me so I could double-check their judgment, and\n\n3. decisions I wanted to make myself.\n\nBut the problem persisted.\n\nAfter a few months, I consulted my mentor. \u201cDo they know what decisions they should make and what decisions you want to\nmake?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre the boxes clear?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I replied, \u201cbut due to the operational nature of our job, if I\u2019m not around, they have to make decisions in the third box\nwithout me. That\u2019s where we\u2019re running into the biggest problems. They seem incapable of doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they know the one thing that\u2019s most important?\u201d he probed.\n\n\u201c[\u2019m not sure what you mean,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s most important differs for each decision.\u201d I listed off a few different types of de-\ncisions and how the variables were different.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean,\u201d he replied. \u201cDo they know what you value most?\u201d I hesitated. He looked me square in the eye. \u201cShane,\ndo you know what you value most?\u201d I stared at him blankly. He sighed. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t your team. It\u2019s you. You don\u2019t know\nwhat's most important. Until you do, your team will never make decisions without you. It\u2019s too risky for them to figure out the\nmost important thing. Communicate that to your team, and they\u2019ll be able to make decisions on their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if they make the wrong decision?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as they make a decision based on the most important thing, they won't be wrong.\u201d He paused, then said slowly, \u201cA lot\n\nof people reach their ceiling in this job because they can\u2019t figure out this one thing.\u201d\n\f"}, "001066.png": {"text": "Ilearned three important lessons that day. First, I couldn\u2019t expect my team to make decisions on their own unless I told them\nhow I wanted them to make those decisions. That meant focusing on the single most important thing and not inundating them\nwith hundreds of variables to consider. Second, if they made the decision with the most important thing in mind, and it turned\nout wrong, I couldn\u2019t get upset with them. IfI did that, they\u2019d never make decisions without me. The third lesson was perhaps the\n\nmost revealing: I myself didn\u2019t know what the most important thing was. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t tell them.\n\nHow to Safeguard the Evaluation Stage\n\nThere is only one most important thing in every project, goal, and company. If you have two or more most important things, you're\nnot thinking clearly. This is an important aspect of leadership and problem-solving in general: you have to pick one criterion above\nall the others and communicate it in a way that your people can understand so they can make decisions on their own. This is true\nleadership. You need to be clear about what values people are to use when making decisions. If I tell you the most important thing\nis serving the customer, you know how to make decisions without me. If you make a bad judgment call, but it puts the customer\nfirst, I can\u2019t fault you. You did what I wanted.\n\nBut identifying what's most important is a skill. It takes practice. Here\u2019s how.\n\nIrecommend using sticky notes for this exercise. First, on each sticky note, write out one criterion\u2014one thing that\u2019s impor-\ntant to you\u2014in evaluating your options.\n\nFor example, before I decided to invest in Pixel Union\u2014one of the largest and best design agencies in the Shopify universe\u2014I\n\nwrote down some criteria that were important to me.\n\f"}, "001067.png": {"text": "They included:\n\n- A win-win for employees, customers, and shareholders\n+ Growing rather than shrinking the business\n\n+ Working with people I trust\n\n+ Not having to manage people or add more to my plate\n\n+ Not borrowing money\n\n- Ahigh probability of a decent return on investment\n\nThere are many more, but you get the idea. Place only one criterion on each sticky note because next, we're going to make your\ncriteria battle.\n\nChoose whichever criterion you think is the most important to you and place it on the wall. Then grab another criterion. Com-\npare each and ask, \u201cIf I absolutely had to choose between only these two, which matters more?\u201d\n\nSo to return to my example of investing in Pixel Union, the first battle might be this: earning a return on investment versus not\nhaving to manage people or add more to my plate.\n\nIf I could have only one of these\u2014if either earning a return on my investment required managing people, or not managing\npeople entailed making less money\u2014which would it be? I\u2019d choose earning more money even if it involved managing people. SoI\u2019'd\nmove that criterion higher.\n\nOf course, I'd be willing to manage people only up to a point. If doing that became too time-consuming, I might have to reverse\nthe order. That leads us to the next step: adding quantities. As your criteria battle one another, you'll find quantities make a differ-\nence. Add them to each criterion as they battle.\n\nSuppose I find that I\u2019m willing to spend five to ten additional hours per week managing people or being hands on, so long as\n\nmy ROlis at least 15 percent per year. If I\u2019d have to invest ten-plus hours per week, my ROI would have to be at least 20 percent per\n\f"}, "001068.png": {"text": "year, and if I\u2019d have to invest twenty-plus hours per week, it would no longer be worth it to me\u2014regardless of anticipated return\u2014\nbecause of the opportunity cost of that time.\n\nWhen you've finished ordering these two criteria, go to the next pair. Move from top to bottom, make your criteria battle one\nanother for priority, and add the quantities that matter to you along the way.\n\nWhen people do this exercise, they often look at a pair of criteria and think, \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily have to choose between those\ntwo.\u201d Make them battle anyway! The point isn\u2019t really to compare them, it\u2019s to find out which one is more important. Maybe in real\nlife you can satisfy both criteria\u2014maybe, for instance, you can get a high ROI while investing in a socially responsible company, or\nyou can get in shape while still eating out three times a week, or you can buy a house in a great location that fits your budget. But\noften, when we actually start pursuing an option, we find that we have to rank one criterion above another\u2014even if only slightly.\nMost of the time, making your criteria battle is about calibrating shades of gray. It\u2019s a mental exercise that takes you out of reactive\nmode and moves you toward deliberative thinking.\n\nAssigning quantitative values to your criteria often helps at this point. When you start comparing things and thinking how\nmuch you'll pay for them\u2014and whether in a currency of time, money, collective brain power\u2014you gain clarity about what matters\nmost to you and what doesn\u2019t. You're forced to think in terms of benefits and risks, and you start to see things you didn\u2019t see before\n\u2014previously invisible costs become visible. For all of these reasons, making your criteria battle moves you toward objectivity and\naccuracy, and helps reveal what you think is most important.\n\nOnce you've settled on your criteria and their order of importance, it\u2019s time to apply them to the options. Doing so requires that\n\nyou have information about those options that meets two conditions: it\u2019s relevant, and it\u2019s accurate.\n\nMost Information Is Irrelevant\n\nWhen it comes to getting information that\u2019s relevant to the decision, remember this:\n\f"}, "001069.png": {"text": "THE TARGETING PRINCIPLE: Know what you're looking for before you start sorting through the data.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what you're looking for, you're unlikely to find it, just as you're unlikely to hit the target if you don\u2019t know what\nyou're aiming at. When you don\u2019t know what's important, you miss things that are relevant and spend a lot of time on things that\nare irrelevant.\n\nMost information is irrelevant. Knowing what to ignore\u2014separating the signal from the noise\u2014is the key to not wasting\nvaluable time. Think, for example, of investment decisions. The best investors know which variables probabilistically govern the\noutcomes, and they pay attention to those. They don\u2019t ignore everything else, but focusing primarily on those variables allows\nthem to filter massive amounts of information very quickly.\n\nPeople who can quickly distinguish what matters from what doesn\u2019t gain a huge advantage in a world where the flow of infor-\n\nmation never stops.\nKnowing what to ignore allows you to focus on what matters. Follow the example of the best investors and know the variables\n\nthat matter for evaluating the options before you start sorting through information.\n\nGetting Accurate Information from the Source\n\nWhen it comes to getting information that\u2019s accurate, there are two principles you should know: the HiFi Principle and the HiEx\nPrinciple. The first will help you find the best intel possible from within any given situation, and the second will help you find the\n\nbest intel possible from outside of it.\n\f"}, "001070.png": {"text": "THE HIFI PRINCIPLE: Get high-fidelity (HiFi) information\u2014\n\ninformation that\u2019s close to the source and unfiltered by other people's biases and interests.\n\nThe quality of your decisions is directly related to the quality of your thoughts. The quality of your thoughts is directly related to\nthe quality of your information.\n\nMany people treat all sources of information as if they\u2019re equally valid. They\u2019re not. While you might value getting everyone\u2019s\nopinion, that doesn\u2019t mean each opinion should be equally weighted or considered.\n\nA lot of the information we consume is in the form of highlights, summaries, or distillations. It\u2019s the illusion of knowledge. We\nJearn the answer but can\u2019t show our work.\n\nConsider what happens when you consult a nutritionist. They take their years of experience and knowledge and compress it\ninto a list of foods to eat and behaviors to implement. If you just want the answer, they will tell you what to eat and how much.\nThis is an abstraction; it\u2019s like you\u2019re back in sixth-grade math class, copying answers from the person beside you. Sure, you got\nthe right answer, but you don\u2019t know why it\u2019s the answer. You lack understanding, and information without understanding is\ndangerous.\n\nIt\u2019s natural to think these abstractions will save us time and improve our decision-making, but in many cases they don\u2019t.\nReading a summary might be faster than reading a full document, but it misses a lot of details\u2014details that weren\u2019t relevant to the\nperson summarizing the information, but that might be relevant to you. You end up saving time at the cost of missing important\ninformation. Skimming inadvertently creates blind spots.\n\nInformation is food for the mind. What you put in today shapes your solutions tomorrow. And just as you are responsible for\n\nthe food that goes into your mouth, you are responsible for the information that goes into your mind. You can\u2019t be healthy if you\n\f"}, "001071.png": {"text": "feed yourself junk food every day, and you can\u2019t make good decisions if you\u2019re consuming low-quality information. Higher quality\ninputs lead to higher quality outputs.\n\nThe desire for abstractions is understandable. The amount of information that bombards us daily can feel overwhelming. But\nthe further the information is from the original source, the more filters it\u2019s been through before getting to you. Living on a diet of\nabstractions is like living on a diet of junk food: it has less nutritional value\u2014less information content, which means you're not\nlearning as much.\n\nReal knowledge is earned, while abstractions are merely borrowed. Too often decision-makers get their information and obser-\nvations from sources that are multiple degrees removed from the problem. Relying on these abstractions is a prime opportunity\nfor the ego default to work its mischief. It conjures the illusion of knowledge: we feel confident about what to do without really un-\nderstanding the problem.\n\nYou can\u2019t make good decisions with bad information. In fact, when you see people making decisions that don\u2019t make sense to\nyou, chances are they\u2019re based on different information than you\u2019ve consumed. Just as junk food eventually makes you unhealthy,\nbad inputs eventually produce bad decisions.\n\nHow do we get better information?\n\nThe person closest to the problem often has the most accurate information about it. What they tend to lack is a broader\nperspective. The person working on the line at McDonald\u2019s knows how to fix a recurring problem at their restaurant better than\na person merely analyzing some data. What they don\u2019t know is how it fits into the bigger picture. They don\u2019t know whether the\nproblem exists everywhere, or whether the solution would cause more harm than good if implemented globally, or how to roll the\nidea out to everyone.\n\nMy friend Tim Urban has a good metaphor to explain this concept. In the restaurant business, there are chefs and there are line\ncooks.2 Both can follow a recipe. When things go according to plan, there is no difference in the process or the result. But when\n\nthings go wrong, the chef knows why. The line cook often does not. The chef has cultivated depth of understanding through years\n\f"}, "001072.png": {"text": "of experience, experimentation, and reflection, and as a result, the chef, rather than the line cook, can diagnose problems when\nthey arise.\n\nHistory shows that the greatest thinkers all used information that they collected personally. They earned their knowledge the\nhard way either in the trenches of experience or through careful study of exemplars. They looked for raw, unfiltered information,\nand ventured out into the world to interact with it directly.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci is a great example. He kept journals throughout his life, and they contain notes about how he went about\ngetting the right information. He wrote things like, \u201cGet the master of arithmetic to show you how to square a triangle,\u201d and \u201cGet a\nmaster of hydraulics to tell you how to repair a lock, canal and mill in the Lombard manner.\u201d\n\nGreat thinkers understand the importance of high-quality information, and that other people's abstractions are often limited\nin their usefulness.\n\nAs information travels up an organization, it tends to lose quality and nuance. Remember that children\u2019s game, telephone:\nyou whisper a sentence to the next person, and that person whispers it to the next, and after it passes through half the class, the\nmessage is nothing like the original sentence. No single person necessarily changes it much, but the more people it passes through,\nthe more all those little changes accumulate. The same thing happens when information travels through an organization. It goes\nthrough multiple filters, including individual levels of understanding, political interpretation, and biases. Details are abstracted\nfrom the original, and the signal is lost. The various incentives people have when they communicate information end up compli-\ncating things even further.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t merely that people are unreliable transmitters of information; the problem is also that there are limitations\non the information that abstractions can represent. Think of a road map. It\u2019s an abstract representation of a real landscape. That\nlandscape includes rocks, plants, animals, cities, wind, and weather, along with many other things. We don\u2019t represent all of them.\nwhen we map the landscape, only those things that interest us\u2014for example, roads, rivers, and geographical boundaries. We pull\nthese features away from the original and represent them in a way that makes them stand out. (That\u2019s in fact what the word \u201cab-\n\nstract\u201d means: \u201cto pull away from.\u201d)\n\f"}, "001073.png": {"text": "Removing what doesn\u2019t serve our interests is what makes a map useful. But somewhere in the process, someone has decided\nwhat\u2019s useful and what isn\u2019t based on what interests them. What if we're interested in something else? What if we're interested in\npopulation densities or geological strata? A road map isn\u2019t designed to highlight these concepts, so it\u2019s not going to be very useful\ntous.\n\nWhat\u2019s true of maps is true of any other abstractions: by nature, they\u2019re designed to serve the interests of their designers. If\nthose designers don\u2019t have the same interests as you, their abstractions aren\u2019t going to give you the information you need. Simi-\nlarly, any information you may get from a secondhand source has likely been filtered through that source\u2019s interests. Since your\ninterests are likely different from theirs, their summaries, highlights, and descriptions are likely to leave out relevant information\nthat could help you with your decision.\n\nTlearned the importance of accurate information while working for the CEO of a large company. Nothing crossed his desk\nwithout going through me first. Early one morning I saw an email from one of his direct reports flagging a technical problem that\nwas affecting operations. After I told him what I\u2019d heard about the problem, he asked a simple question: \u201cWhere did you get this\ninformation?\u201d I replied that I\u2019d heard it from the VP in charge of the division. The look on his face instantly turned to disappoint-\nment. Moments passed in silence.\n\nFinally, he spoke softly, telling me that his decisions could only be as good as his information.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t getting the raw HiFi information. He knew that people in the organization had an incentive to convey things ina\nway that covered up mistakes or made themselves look good. And he knew that those filters would obscure rather than clarify the\nsituation.\n\nIf you want to make better decisions, you need better information. Whenever possible, you need to learn something, see some-\n\nthing, or do something for yourself. Sometimes the best information is the least transmissible.\n\f"}, "001074.png": {"text": "HiFi Information Reveals Better Options\n\nUnited States general George Marshall was a supremely competent and selfless leader. He never left the welfare of his troops to\nchance. He valued HiFi information and always went to the source.\n\nAt one point during World War II, the War Department ran into a difficult situation with the Air Force in the Pacific: pilots\nwere refusing to fly. The reports Marshall received suggested there was something wrong with the planes. It wasn\u2019t a matter of\nparts. They were getting all the parts they were asking for. Marshall asked if the pilots wanted the planes modified in some way.\nThe American planes were heavier and less maneuverable than the Japanese Zeros, so he had a plane stripped of its armor to reduce\nits weight. But that wasn\u2019t the problem. The pilots didn\u2019t want their planes stripped of armor.\n\nMarshall struggled to understand what was going on. Talking to the commander gave him no insight, so he did what he often\nwould: he sent someone \u201cto look around and see things that weren't being reported\u2014not just what they were yelling about.\u201d No\none likes the person sent from the head office to check on things\u2014neither the commander nor the line cook. Everyone is suspi-\ncious. But Marshall needed eyes and ears on the ground to get to the heart of the matter. He knew he'd only get answers by going\ndirectly to the source.\n\nWhat Marshall\u2019s direct report uncovered was that the Air Force ground crews didn\u2019t have any protection from mosquitoes.\nThey had to work on the planes at night under electric lights, which attracted insects, and those mosquitoes were feasting on\nthem. The mechanics had gotten so full of malaria or antimalarial medication that the pilots didn\u2019t trust their work and refused to\nfly.\n\nThe people back at headquarters, in mosquito-protected areas, had no idea what was really going on in the field. They were\nfocused on combat supplies\u2014ammunition, parts, food\u2014but not mosquito netting. With his HiFi information, though, Marshall\n\ndecided to override a portion of the tonnage they\u2019d allocated for combat supplies and get those nets. Problem solved!\n\f"}, "001075.png": {"text": "Marshall recognized that the only way to understand a problem and solve it was by going to the source.

Try something out to see what kinds of results it yields.\n\nAn experiment is a low-risk way of gathering important information. For example, if you want to know whether people will pay\nfor something, try to sell it before you even create it. That\u2019s what my friends at Tuft & Needle did. They were one of the first com-\npanies to ship foam mattresses directly to consumers\u2019 homes. They shared an incredible story with me over coffee one day, about\ntheir early days. In order to validate their idea, they set up a landing page, bought some Facebook ads, and started taking orders.\nThey didn\u2019t even have a product or a company yet; they just wanted to see if people would buy foam mattresses from them. After a\nfew days of receiving orders, they had all the proof they needed that people would buy their product. They refunded all the orders\nand officially started their company. While this example may be a bit unorthodox, there are many ways in which experimenting\n\ncan help determine whether there\u2019s sufficient demand for a product or service.\n\nSAFEGUARD: Evaluate the motivations and incentives of your sources. Remember that everyone sees things from a limited\n\nperspective.\n\f"}, "001076.png": {"text": "Evaluating people\u2019s motivations and incentives is especially important when you don\u2019t have the ability to go and confirm some-\nthing for yourself. If you absolutely must rely on someone else\u2019s information and opinions, you have a responsibility to think\nabout the lens through which they view the situation. Everyone has a limited perspective into the problem. Everyone has a blind\nspot. It\u2019s your job as the decision-maker to weave their perspective together with others to get closer to reality.\n\nA lot of what people consider information or fact is actually just opinion, or a few facts mixed with many opinions. For exam-\nple, if you're looking to sell your house, everyone who's involved will have a different idea of what you'll make on the sale: the bank,\nyour real estate agent, the buyer\u2019s agent, your friends, the home inspector, the internet, and the government. Each of them sees\nonly part of the situation. Each has different motivations and incentives that shape how they see the world. To get a clearer picture\nof the concrete reality, consider how each person stands to benefit from the information they give you, and weave those perspec-\ntives together.\n\nIt helps to think of each person\u2019s perspective as a lens onto the world. When you put their glasses on, you see what they see and\nhave better insight into what they might be feeling. But those glasses have blind spots, often missing important information or\nconfusing fact with opinion. By trying on all the glasses, you see what others miss.\n\nWhen you're getting information from other people, you need to keep an open mind. That means withholding your own\njudgment as long as possible. People often undermine the information-gathering process by subjecting others to their judgments,\nbeliefs, and perspective. The point isn\u2019t to argue or disagree, however. Judging people and telling them they\u2019re wrong only shuts\nthem down and prevents a free flow of information. When you're gathering information, your job is to see the world through other\npeople\u2019s eyes. You're trying to understand their experience and how they processed it.

How do those variables relate\n\nto one another?\n\nQuestion 2: What do you know about this problem that I (or other people) don\u2019t?

The word\n\u201crecent\u201d is an important nuance here. When you want specific advice from an expert, look for someone who recently solved the\nproblem you're trying to solve. Asking someone who solved your problem twenty years ago how they did it is not likely to offer spe-\ncific and effective insights. You want a current expert\u2014and no, I don\u2019t mean the talking heads on TV. They\u2019re rarely actual experts.\n\nExperts can increase the accuracy of your information and decrease the time it takes to get it.

Days went by. Then\nweeks. I couldn\u2019t understand what was happening.

In less than twenty minutes he diagnosed what was wrong: there was a subtle difference\nbetween what the documentation said would happen and what would actually happen in certain edge cases.

This person had faced and overcome the same\nproblem, though, and it had taken him a long time to solve. He was happy to share his hard-earned knowledge.

Let me share what I\u2019ve learned on both recruiting experts and working with\n\nthem.\n\nGetting Experts on Your Side\n\nMany people don\u2019t want to reach out to experts for help, either because they don\u2019t think it\u2019s an option, or because they\u2019re afraid of\n\nbeing a nuisance. Sometimes, if we know the expert, we\u2019re embarrassed. Maybe they\u2019Il discover we know less than we actually do!\n\f"}, "001080.png": {"text": "If you have any anxieties of this sort, the first thing to understand is that experts Jove sharing what they\u2019ve learned when they\nknow it'll make a difference. Helping others achieve their goals is one of the things that make life and work meaningful. To put it\nin perspective, think of a time in your life when someone asked you for help on something you excel at, and you came through for\nthem. How did it feel? For most of us, sharing expertise feels pretty good. We enjoy exercising an ability we have, and we also enjoy\ngaining recognition for having it.\n\nExperts don\u2019t treat all requests for help equally, though. Some requests really don\u2019t feel good to receive. Usually these are re-\nquests of the tell-me-what-I-should-do type. Often these people haven\u2019t done the work ahead of time, they just want you to decide\nfor them. I get hundreds\u2014if not thousands\u2014of these requests a year. People want me to solve their problems for them. They send\ntwenty pages of thoughts and say, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d=2\n\nRemember: the goal isn\u2019t to have someone tell you what to do; rather, it\u2019s to learn how an expert thinks about the problem,\nwhich variables they consider relevant, and how those variables interact over time. If you present a problem, and an expert simply\ntells you what to do, they\u2019re just giving you an abstraction. You might get the answer right, but you haven't learned anything. And\nif things go wrong, which they inevitably will, you won't have a clue as to why. You're the line cook masquerading as the chef. If\nyou ask them how they think about the problem, that\u2019s when you start deepening your understanding.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how to approach an expert in a way that will set your request apart and get people excited to help you. Here\n\nare five tips:\n\n+ Show that you have skin in the game: When you reach out to an expert, make them aware of the time, energy, and money\nyou've already invested in the problem. Let them know you've done the work and that you're stuck. When I see requests from\nsomeone who shows they\u2019re invested in solving a problem, and who demonstrates they\u2019ve done their research to craft a pitch\naround a very specific issue I can help with, I\u2019m happy and eager to respond. Contrast that with emails that say, \u201cHey Shane,\n\nwhat do you think of this investment opportunity?\u201d Which would you be more excited to answer?\n\f"}, "001081.png": {"text": "+ Get precise on your ask: Be very clear what you're looking for. Are you looking for them to review your plan and provide\nfeedback? Are you looking for them to introduce you to people who can solve the problem? Whatever it is that you want, just\nbe clear.\n\n+ Show respect for their time and energy: Explicitly stating that the person you're reaching out to is an expert whose time\nand energy you respect goes a long way to secure their goodwill. You should also demonstrate your respect for them, though.\nFor instance, do not ask for fifteen minutes to pick their brain; instead, ask if they offer one-off consulting sessions and how\nmuch they charge for them. Experts are expensive and most of the time for good reason. If you\u2019re paying $1,000 to $2,000 per\nhour for something, it forces you to get clear on what you want before you hop on the call. Paying for someone\u2019s time not only\ncompensates them for the value they bring to the table but forces you to make sure you're not mumbling through the call and\nwasting their time and yours.\n\n- Ask for their reasons and listen: As mentioned previously, don\u2019t just ask experts what they think, ask them how they think.\nUse them as a resource to train yourself how to evaluate things so that you can start embodying an expert way of operating.\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with what they\u2019re saying, but remember: your goal is to learn from them how to think better, not to\nhave them solve your problem for you.\n\n+ Follow up: If you want to build a network and make this more than a transactional request, follow up to report on your\nprogress no matter what the outcome is. Whether their advice helped you in this case or not, following up and keeping them\nupdated on your progress primes them to help you in the future. When they see that you took their advice seriously, they\u2019re\n\ngoing to want to help you again.\n\nOf course, most experts aren't able to respond to everyone who needs their help. It\u2019s much easier if you develop a personal relation-\nship with people before you need their help. That way the request isn\u2019t purely transactional. It\u2019s impossible to predict which fields\n\nyou might someday need an expert in, but that\u2019s one reason to cast a wide net socially and professionally.

But there are many people who claim to be experts (or\n\nwhom other people claim to be experts) who really aren't.\n\nsareGuaro: Take time to distinguish real experts from imitators. Not everyone who claims to be an expert is. Take the time to know\n\nthe difference.\n\nThink of all the money managers who borrow their talking points from Warren Buffett. They might sound like Buffett, but they\ndon\u2019t know how to invest the way Buffett does. They\u2019re imitators. Charlie Munger once commented on this: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to tell\nthe difference between a good money manager and someone who just has the patter down.\u201d\n\nBut what if you're not an expert yourself? How do you tell the difference between an expert and an imitator?\n\nExperts are usually enthusiastic about their area of expertise. That\u2019s why they\u2019re good at it: they spend even their spare time\nmastering and refining their knowledge and skills, and it shows. Imitators are less concerned with being great and more con-\n\ncerned with looking great. That concern makes it easy for the ego to take over.\n\f"}, "001083.png": {"text": "Here are some things to look for:\n\n+ Imitators can\u2019t answer questions at a deeper level. Specific knowledge is earned, not learned, so imitators don\u2019t fully under-\nstand the ideas they\u2019re talking about.\u21222 Their knowledge is shallow. As a result, when you ask about details, or first principles\nor nonstandard cases, they don\u2019t have good answers.\n\n+ Imitators can\u2019t adapt their vocabulary. They can explain things using only the vocabulary they were taught, which is often\nfull of jargon. Because they don\u2019t fully understand the ideas behind the vocabulary, they can\u2019t adapt the way they talk about\nthose ideas to express them more clearly to their audience.\n\n+ Imitators get frustrated when you say you don\u2019t understand. That frustration is a result of being overly concerned with the\nappearance of expertise\u2014which they might not be able to maintain if they have to really get into the weeds with an explana-\ntion. Real experts have earned their expertise and are excited about trying to share what they know. They aren't frustrated by\nyour lack of understanding; they instead love your genuine curiosity about something they care about.\n\n+ Experts can tell you all the ways they\u2019ve failed. They know and accept that some form of failure is often part of the learning\nprocess. Imitators, however, are less likely to own up to mistakes because they\u2019re afraid it will tarnish the image they\u2019re trying\nto project.\n\n+ Imitators don\u2019t know the limits of their expertise. Experts know what they know, and also know what they don\u2019t know.\nThey understand that their understanding has boundaries, and they\u2019re able to tell you when they\u2019re approaching the lim-\nits of their circle of competence. Imitators can\u2019t. They can\u2019t tell when they\u2019re crossing the boundary into things they don\u2019t\n\nunderstand.\n\nA final note on distinguishing experts from imitators: Many of us learn about a subject not by reading original research or listening\nto the expert for hours, but by reading something intended to be highly transmissible. Think again of the difference between\nreading an academic article and reading a newspaper article about it. While they know more than the layman, popularizers are not\n\nexperts themselves. Instead, they are good at clearly and memorably communicating ideas. As a result, popularizers often get mis-\n\f"}, "001084.png": {"text": "taken for experts.

If you want results, you need action.\n\nMaking a judgment and executing it is easier than it seems and harder than others imagine. One reason we fail to take action is\nthat we're scared to deal with the consequences. It\u2019s not so much that we don\u2019t know what to do as much as we don\u2019t want to deal\nwith the reality of doing it.

But first, let\u2019s discuss a helpful\n\nway of categorizing decisions by considering how consequential they are, and how reversible they are.\n\nConsequentiality and Reversibility\n\nConsequential decisions affect the things that matter most: whom you marry, where you live, which business you launch. The\nmore a decision affects what matters to you\u2014either in the short term or the long term\u2014the more consequential it is.\n\nReversible decisions can be undone by a later course of action. The harder or more costly it is to undo a decision\u2019s effects, the\nless reversible it is. It\u2019s easy to eat a chocolate bar, but once you've eaten it, it\u2019s done. You can\u2019t undo it. Having a baby is the same.\nOnce you have one, you can\u2019t undo it (nor would you want to!). At the other extreme would be a decision whose effects cost noth-\ning to undo. I can decide to sign up for a free fourteen-day trial of something, knowing full well it\u2019s easy to undo.\n\nWe can represent different kinds of decisions in terms of their degrees of consequence and reversibility on a graph (see the\nfollowing figure). Among these decisions, two types deserve special attention: decisions that are highly consequential and irre-\nversible, and decisions that are inconsequential and highly reversible.\n\nWhen a decision is highly consequential and irreversible, its effects ripple throughout your life, and there\u2019s no way to stop\nthem. Some people call these \u201clead dominoes.\u201d\n\nWhen decisions are like lead dominoes, the cost of a mistake is high. Exactly the opposite is true of a decision that\u2019s inconse-\nquential and easily reversed. The cost of a mistake is low: if you don\u2019t like the outcome, you can just reverse it. The biggest mistake\nin cases like these is wasting time and mental energy.

You finally decide on a mattress, and have it\ndelivered, only to find that it isn\u2019t what you dreamed of. So you exchange it for your fallback option anyway. You could have saved\nhours or days simply ensuring the store had a flexible return policy, deciding on a mattress within an hour, and moving on.

Just choose. Decide quickly,\nand learn by doing. You'll save time, energy, and resources that you can use for decisions that really matter.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the decision is highly consequential and irreversible, then the stakes are high. The biggest risk here is\nmoving too fast and missing something important. You want to gather as much information as you can before deciding. There-\n\nfore, the second principle is:\n\nTHE ALAP PRINCIPLE: If the cost to undo a decision is high, make it as late as possible.\n\f"}, "001089.png": {"text": "Remember to factor the cost of analysis into your decisions. This is something many people fail to do. Most decisions require an art\nthat balances speed and accuracy. When you move too slowly on small decisions, you waste time and energy, no matter how accu-\nrate you may be. When you go too fast, you miss crucial information, make assumptions, overlook the basics, rush to judgment,\nand often solve the wrong problem. When things are hectic, however\u2014even when speed matters\u2014you need to slow down, just a\nlittle.\n\nMichael Lewis gives an example of this in The Undoing Project about a woman who crashed head on into another car.1 Medics\nrushed her to Sunnybrook Hospital, which is located next to Canada\u2019s busiest stretch of highway. Sunnybrook had a reputation\nfor treating the emergencies and traumas that come from car crashes, yet the woman had so many broken bones, the physicians\nmissed some. Don Redelmeier was the Sunnybrook epidemiologist. His job was to \u201ccheck the understanding of the specialists for\nmental errors.\u201d He was there, in other words, to check other people\u2019s thinking. \u201cWherever there is uncertainty there has got to be\njudgment,\u201d said Redelmeier, \u201cand wherever there is judgment there is an opportunity for human fallibility.\u201d Doctors may be ex-\nperts, but they\u2019re still human, still fallible, and to complicate things further, their patients often give them unreliable information.\n\nWhen things move fast, and life-and-death decisions need to be made, we often see only the things we're specifically trained\nto see, and miss others that are nevertheless relevant. In this case, the woman presented another problem beyond all the broken\nbones: her heartbeat was highly irregular. Before she lost consciousness, she mentioned a history of an overactive thyroid, which is\na classic cause of an irregular heartbeat.\n\nRedelmeier entered as the team looking after her was preparing to administer the drugs for hyperthyroidism: \u201c[He] asked\neveryone to slow down. To wait. Just a moment. Just to check their thinking\u2014and to make sure they were not trying to force the\nfacts into an easy, coherent, but ultimately false story.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to slow things down because they had leaped to a conclusion that seemed to fit without considering other reasons:\n\u201cHyperthyroidism is a classic cause of an irregular heart rhythm, but hyperthyroidism is an infrequent cause of an irregular heart\n\nrhythm,\u201d he would say later. While it fit, it was unlikely\u2014possible but not probable.\n\f"}, "001090.png": {"text": "The staff began searching for other causes, and quickly determined she had a collapsed lung. \u201cLike her fractured ribs, her col-\nlapsed lung had failed to turn up on the X-ray. Unlike the fractured ribs, it could kill her.\u201d They ignored the thyroid and treated the\ncollapsed lung, and her heartbeat returned to normal. When her official thyroid tests came back the next day, they were normal. As\nRedelmeier said, \u201cYou need to be so careful when there is one simple diagnosis that instantly pops into your mind that beautifully\nexplains everything all at once. That\u2019s when you need to stop and check your thinking.\u201d\n\nWhen the stakes are high, and there are no take-backs, you want to decide at the last moment possible, and keep as many op-\ntions on the table as you can while continuing to gather information.\n\nIn driver\u2019s education, we learn that when you're on the freeway driving at high speeds, you need to keep a pocket open in front\nof you in case someone unexpectedly veers into your lane or stops abruptly. Keeping extra distance between cars allows you to\nkeep options open for whatever might happen. This is the same reason you should wait as long as possible when making an impor-\ntant decision. You want to give yourself as many options in the future so that if something changes, you have the space to maneu-\nver and reposition yourself along the path of greatest opportunity.\n\nHow do you know when it\u2019s finally time to act?\n\nWhen the cost of failure is cheap, the speed at which you come to a decision matters as much as the decision itself. When fail-\nure is expensive, it makes sense to learn more before taking action.\n\nDefaults can transform caution into an excuse not to act if you don\u2019t resist them.

If you\u2019ve ever struggled with analysis paralysis, a third principle can help you know when to stop deliberating and\n\nstart acting:\n\nTHE STOP, FLOP, KNOW PRINCIPLE: Stop gathering more information and execute your decision when either you Stop gathering useful\ninformation, you First Lose an OPportunity (FLOP), or you come to Know something that makes it evident what option you\n\nshould choose.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the Stop, FLOP, and Know conditions one at a time.\n\nFirst, when you've stopped gathering useful information, it\u2019s time to act. More information isn\u2019t always better, and there are\nsigns that you've gathered enough. When I interviewed The Princeton Review co-founder Adam Robinson,? for instance, he told\nme about a seminal study done by a psychologist named Paul Slovic back in 1974 that illustrates the folly of gathering too much\ninformation.\n\nSlovic put eight horse handicappers in the same room and told them he wanted to see how well they could predict the winners\n\nof forty horse races, over four rounds of ten races each. In the first round each handicapper was given any five pieces of informa-\n\f"}, "001093.png": {"text": "tion he wanted on each horse. One handicapper might want the height and weight of the jockey; another might want the highest\nfinish a horse had ever had. The handicappers also had to state how confident they were in their predictions.\n\nAt the end of the first round, with only five pieces of information, they were 17 percent accurate. Given there were ten horses\ntoa race, they were 70 percent better than the 10 percent chance they\u2019d have with zero information. They were 19 percent confi-\ndent in their predictions, which isn\u2019t too far from their actual results.\n\nEach round gave them more and more information. For round two they were given ten pieces of information, then twenty in\nround three, and forty in the fourth and final round.\n\nIn the final round, they were still only 17 percent accurate. The thirty-five additional pieces of information did, however, move\ntheir confidence level to 34 percent. All of the extra information made them no more accurate but a lot more confident.\n\nConfidence increases faster than accuracy. \u201cThe trouble with too much information,\u201d Robinson told me, \u201cis you can\u2019t reason\nwith it.\u201d It only feeds confirmation bias. We ignore additional information that doesn\u2019t agree with our assessment, and gain confi-\ndence from additional information that does.\n\nIn my life and in the lives of people I\u2019ve worked with, these are some signs you've hit the limit of useful information you can\n\ngather:\n\n+ You are able to argue credibly for and against the options you're considering from all angles.\n\n+ You're stretching for insight by asking people for advice who are more than one step removed from the problem or who don\u2019t\nhave experience solving problems of this sort.\n\n+ You feel like you need to learn more, but you've stopped learning new things, and are instead in a constant loop reviewing the\n\nsame information (or same arguments) over and over.\n\nWhen you've hit any of these points, you\u2019ve probably gotten all the useful information you're going to get. It\u2019s time to decide.\n\nThat\u2019s Stop, now let\u2019s move on to FLOP.\n\f"}, "001094.png": {"text": "If you're facing a highly consequential and irreversible decision, and you're waiting as long as possible to make up your mind,\nthe time to decide is when you start losing opportunities. For example, if you're selling a house, you might want to wait as long\nas possible to actually sell it. You go as far as listing it, setting a price, and getting offers, but when buyers start walking away, or\nyou're about to break a legal contract, then you're starting to lose options, and it\u2019s time to act.\n\nLikewise, suppose your partner wants to take your relationship to the next level\u2014be it going exclusive, living together, or get-\nting engaged. Those are big defining moments in your relationship, and if you're unsure, it makes sense to take your time deciding.\nBut eventually your partner is going to get fed up and walk away. Right before that happens, when your partner makes it clear that\nyou're on the threshold of losing options, it\u2019s time to decide.\n\nRemember, the rationale behind the ALAP Principle is to preserve optionality. When options start diminishing, it\u2019s time to act\nusing whatever information you have. That\u2019s FLOP: if you\u2019re waiting to decide, wait no longer than your First Lost Opportunity.\n\nIt\u2019s finally time to act when you come to know something that makes it clear what you should do. Sometimes you gather a\ncritical piece of information that makes your decision easy, perhaps a First Lost Opportunity. Other times, especially in more\nambiguous situations like relationships, it\u2019s just a gut feeling that doesn\u2019t go away or change.

Avoiding the worst outcomes maintains optionality and keeps you\nmoving forward.\n\nSometimes things fail for reasons beyond our control. A lot of tricky and highly consequential decisions, though, fail for pre-\nventable reasons. When we don\u2019t consider how things might go wrong and plan for them in advance, we're left flat-footed when\nthey do go wrong. Then we end up reacting instead of reasoning.

The problem is that you don\u2019t know in what year you'll need to make a claim, so you buy it every year. It\nmight seem like a waste of money in years when nothing happens, but it shows its real value in years when something does.\n\nBuilding a margin of safety means giving yourself as much cushioning and coverage in the future as possible. It\u2019s a way of\npreparing yourself for the widest range of possible future outcomes\u2014and protecting yourself against the worst ones. In the second\nscenario, for instance, you can prepare yourself for the various bad outcomes that 1998 might bring by investing only one tenth\nof your portfolio in the fund. As a result, when the 1998 financial crisis comes, you'll lose at most 10 percent of your investments.\nThat won't leave you happy, but it won\u2019t leave you financially ruined either.\n\nYour defaults are hard at work in the first scenario\u2014not just the social default that convinces you that you're better off follow-\ning the crowd, but the ego default as well. It convinces you that you don\u2019t need a margin of safety, because you know what\u2019s going\nto happen. You feel confident predicting the future\u2014predicting that the future is going to be like the past, that LTCM\u2019s fourth year\nis going to be like its first three.

It makes little sense if\nyou know what you are doing.\u201d The thing is, most of us rarely know what we are doing with the confidence required to go all in.\nWhen you don\u2019t know what you are doing, a margin of safety saves you from the worst outcomes.

The minute you convince yourself\nyou could have done better without a margin of safety is exactly when you need it most.\n\nWe can\u2019t prepare for everything. Some horrific events defy imagination, and no amount of preparation can ever give you\nenough optionality to deal with them. Yet we know from history that there are certain unfortunate events that we\u2019re guaranteed\n\nto experience and that we can in fact prepare for, even if we have no idea when they\u2019ll arrive. On a personal level, these include:\n\n+ Grief from losing a loved one\n+ Health issues\n\n+ Relationship changes\n\n+ Financial pressures\n\n+ Challenges in meeting our career goals\nOna more macro level, they include the following:\n\n+ War and political dissent\n\n- Natural disasters\n\n+ Environmental and ecological changes\n\n+ Economic fluctuations: both collapse and growth\n\n+ Technological advances and resistance to them\n\nHow do you build a margin of safety?\n\nLet\u2019s start with a very typical application. Engineers build margins of safety into everything they design. Suppose, for in-\nstance, that we're designing a bridge and calculate that on an average day it will need to support 5,000 tons at any one time.\n\nIf we build it to withstand 5,001 tons, we have no margin of safety: What if there\u2019s heavier traffic than usual one day? What\n\nif our calculations and estimates are a little off? What if the material weakens over time at a rate faster than we imagined? To\n\f"}, "001100.png": {"text": "account for all of these contingencies, we\u2019d need to design the bridge to withstand 10,000 or even 20,000 tons. Why? Because we\ndon\u2019t know what the future will bring. We don\u2019t know whether multiple trucks will ever get stuck on the bridge at the same time.\n\u2018We don\u2019t know whether vehicles in the future will be much heavier than they are now. We don\u2019t know many things about the fu-\nture. So we design the bridge in a way that protects travelers in the widest range of possible future outcomes.\n\nKeep in mind as you're preparing for the future that the worst outcomes in history have always surprised people at the time.\nYou can\u2019t use the historical worst case as your baseline. Engineers don\u2019t rely just on the historical use of current bridges. You have\nto really stretch your imagination to explore and anticipate what could potentially go wrong.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple heuristic for creating a margin of safety so you know when \u201cenough is enough.\u201d\n\ntip: The margin of safety is often sufficient when it can absorb double the worst-case scenario. So the baseline for a margin of\nsafety is one that could withstand twice the amount of problems that would cause a crisis, or maintain twice the amount of re-\n\nsources needed to rebuild after a crisis.\n\nFor example, if you want to feel financially secure even if you lose your job, you can estimate how long it will take you to gain em-\nployment again, and then save enough to live off savings for double that amount of time.\n\nThat\u2019s our baseline. But we need to adapt our margin of safety to the individual and situational circumstances. If the cost of\nfailure is high, and outcomes are more consequential, you want a large margin of safety. For instance, if you\u2019re worried about los-\ning your job, and you're in a sector or economy that\u2019s volatile, you'll want to increase the length of time you can take care of your-\nself while unemployed.\n\nIf the cost of failure is low, and outcomes are less consequential, you can often reduce or skip the margin of safety. The longer\nsomething exists and performs well, the higher the probability that its pattern of success will continue. Coca-Cola isn\u2019t going any-\n\nwhere in the near future; neither is Johnson & Johnson.\n\f"}, "001101.png": {"text": "Yet even established patterns aren\u2019t foolproof.

On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving,\nsomething unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief.\u201d Our outcomes can sometimes upend even our\nmost well-established expectations.\n\nHowever, if you have a lot of expertise and data, you can reduce your margin of safety yet further. Here\u2019s an example: Warren\nBuffett aims to buy stocks that are 30-50 percent less than their true value. So he has a 30-50 percent margin of safety on stocks.\nBut he\u2019ll pay close to a dollar on the dollar for stocks that he understands well. So there\u2019s only maybe a 20 percent margin of safety\non the stocks he\u2019s the most confident in.\n\nOne of Warren Buffett\u2019s core tenets for buying a business is that if he doesn\u2019t understand it, he doesn\u2019t buy it. In other words,\nif he doesn\u2019t have enough information to calculate a margin of safety, he doesn\u2019t invest at all. He also knows that not all margins of\nsafety will protect him\u2014the goal isn\u2019t to get it perfect for every stock he buys; it\u2019s to use the best possible strategy for all his stocks\nin the big picture.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: Predicting the future is harder than it seems. Things are great until they\u2019re not. If things are good, a\nmargin of safety seems like a waste. When things go wrong, though, you can\u2019t live without it. You need a margin of safety most at\n\nthe very moment you start to think you don't.\n\nBullets before Cannonballs\n\nIf you're still gathering information, don\u2019t get overinvested in just one option.

In Great by Choice, Morten Hansen and Jim Collins call\n\nthis approach shooting bullets before cannonballs:2\n\nPicture yourself at sea, a hostile ship bearing down on you. You have a limited amount of gunpowder. You take all your\ngunpowder and use it to fire a big cannonball. The cannonball flies out over the ocean ... and misses the target, off by\n40 degrees. You turn to your stockpile and discover that you're out of gunpowder. You die.\n\nBut suppose instead that when you see the ship bearing down, you take a little bit of gunpowder and fire a bullet.\nIt misses by 40 degrees. You make another bullet and fire. It misses by 30 degrees. You make a third bullet and fire,\nmissing by only 10 degrees. The next bullet hits\u2014ping!\u2014the hull of the oncoming ship. Now, you take all the remain-\n\ning gunpowder and fire a big cannonball along the same line of sight, which sinks the enemy ship. You live.2\n\nHere\u2019s an example of bullets before cannonballs that I witnessed in real life. A client of mine\u2014we'll call him Solomon\u2014was looking\nto hire someone to run his manufacturing business so he could step down and pursue other opportunities. He tried twice to\nchoose a CEO to replace him. But each time, while the candidate looked great on paper, they didn\u2019t work out in practice.\n\nIrecommended that instead of investing heavily in one candidate and turning down others, he should have two or three can-\ndidates perform a small test project lasting a couple weeks. These small simultaneous tests would maintain his optionality, and\nseeing the candidates perform in real life would be magnitudes more insightful than interviewing them or reading their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\n\nThe two candidates were paid well for their time and tasked with a project that required them to work with the team to under-\nstand the problem, gather information, and chart a course forward.\n\nThe plan worked, and it yielded a surprising result: the candidate with the less impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was far and away the best\nwith the team and made recommendations that ended up saving Solomon's company more than they\u2019d paid for the project.

So much energy is spent getting to the top that even if climbers are running out of strength or oxygen, they keep pushing\nthemselves to the summit. They spend so much of their resources getting there, they neglect to account for the ordeal of getting\nback.

Execution fail-safes leverage your thinking when you're at your best to protect you against the\ndefaults when you're at your worst.\n\nThe idea of an execution fail-safe is well illustrated by the Greek myth of Ulysses. Ulysses was the captain of his ship. He and\nhis crew were navigating close to the island inhabited by the Sirens, dangerous creatures that lured sailors to their deaths with\ntheir song\u2014a song so beautiful that it drove crews mad with longing till they ran their ships against the rocks trying to reach its\nsource.\n\nUlysses wanted to hear the Sirens\u2019 song without risking the lives of his crew. Now, I\u2019m not saying that Ulysses made a great\n\ndecision here.

He also instructed them that the more he struggled and insisted\non changing course, the tighter they should bind him.\n\nUlysses\u2019s clever implementation of execution fail-safes allowed him to hear the song while ensuring the safety of his crew. Of\n\ncourse, fail-safes are indispensable in a lot of other contexts too.\n\nThree Kinds of Execution Fail-Safes\n\nThere are three kinds of execution fail-safes you should know: setting trip wires, empowering others to make decisions, and tying\n\nyour hands.\n\nFAIL-SAFE: Set up trip wires to determine in advance what you'll do when you hit a specific quantifiable time, amount, or circum-\n\nstance.\n\nTrip wires are forms of precommitment\u2014you commit yourself in advance to a course of action when certain conditions arise. For\nexample, a team climbing Everest might set up a trip wire by committing themselves to abort their summit attempt if they don\u2019t\nreach a certain location by a certain time.

The sooner you catch yourself going the wrong way,\nthe easier it is to turn back. The other day I ended up going east on the highway when I wanted to go west.

If something happens to the boss, the\nbusiness and mission fail.\n\nCommander\u2019s intent empowers each person on a team to initiate and improvise as they\u2019re executing the plan. It stops you\nfrom being the bottleneck, and it enables the team to keep each other accountable to the goal without your presence.\n\nCommander's intent has four components: formulate, communicate, interpret, and implement. The first two components\u2014\nformulate and communicate\u2014are the responsibility of the senior commander. You must communicate the strategy, the rationale,\nand the operational limits to the team. Tell them not just what to do, but why to do it, how you arrived at your decision, so they\nunderstand the context, as well as the boundaries for effective action\u2014what is completely off the table. Subordinate commanders\nthen have the tools for the last two components: interpreting the changing contexts and implementing the strategy in those\ncontexts.\n\nBefore you begin executing a decision, just so there\u2019s no confusion as you move forward, ask yourself:\n\n+ Who needs to know my goals and the outcomes I\u2019m working toward?\n+ Do they know what the most important objective is?\n\n+ Do they know the positive and negative signs to look for and what trip wires are attached to them?\n\nOne sign that you've failed to empower your team is that you can\u2019t be away from the office for a week without things falling apart.\nSome leaders think it makes them indispensable\u2014that the team\u2019s inability to function without them is a sign of how important\nthey are. Don't be fooled! This is the ego default at work. Effective leaders shouldn't have to be available 24/7 for their team to make\ndecisions and achieve objectives. If you can\u2019t be away, it doesn\u2019t mean that you're indispensable or a supremely competent leader; it\nmeans that you\u2019re an incompetent communicator.\n\nAnother sign that you're in the grips of the ego default is that you insist on controlling how everything happens.

That\u2019s your job. The quality of your decisions eventually determines how far\nyou go and how fast you get there. If you learn to make great decisions consistently, you'll quickly move past the people whose de-\ncisions are merely good.\n\nNo one is smart enough to make great decisions without learning first, though. Great decision-makers have mastered the\nability to learn both from their mistakes and from their successes. It\u2019s that ability that sets them apart. It enables them to repeat\ntheir successes and avoid repeating their failures. Unless you develop that ability yourself, you won't improve your decision-mak-\ning process over time.\n\nA few years ago, a firm engaged me to help them improve the quality of their decisions. As a first step, we needed to find out\nwhere they were at. We started by trying to answer a single question: When their decision-makers expected a particular result,\n\nhow often did that result happen for the reasons they thought it would?\n\f"}, "001111.png": {"text": "What we discovered shocked them: Their decision-makers were right only about 20 percent of the time. Most of the time when\nsomething that they anticipated actually happened, it didn\u2019t happen for the reasons they thought it would. Their success, in other\nwords, wasn\u2019t due to insight or effort or skill. It was more luck than skill. This news was a blow to their egos. They thought that the\nsuccesses they enjoyed resulted largely from their abilities, but the numbers told a different story. They were like people getting\nlucky at roulette and attributing their success to having a \u201csystem.\u201d\n\nThe story illustrates a psychological phenomenon we\u2019ve discussed before: self-serving bias, the tendency to evaluate things in\nways that enhance our self-image. When we succeed at something, we tend to attribute our success to our ability or effort. By con-\ntrast, when we fail at something, we tend to attribute our failure to external factors. Basically, heads I\u2019m right. Tails, I\u2019m not wrong.\nIf you want to get better, you have to rewrite the faulty narratives.\n\nSelf-serving bias gets in the way of learning from your decisions and improving your process. Our ego default wants us to\nthink that we\u2019re smarter than we are and tells us that we work harder and know more than we actually do. The overconfidence\nthat the ego demon inspires prevents us from examining our decisions with a critical eye. It keeps us from distinguishing skill\nfrom luck\u2014what\u2019s in our control from what isn\u2019t. If you get trapped by the demon, you'll never learn from your decisions and\nnever get better at making them in the future.\n\nThe first principle to keep in mind when evaluating your decisions is this:\n\nTHE PROCESS PRINCIPLE: When you evaluate a decision, focus on the process you used to make the decision and not the outcome.\n\nConventional wisdom suggests that good outcomes result from good people making good decisions and bad outcomes result from.\nbad people making bad decisions. But it\u2019s easy to find counterexamples. We've all made bad decisions, yet we're not all bad people.\n\nAnd even good decisions can have unexpected and unfortunate outcomes thanks to the necessary uncertainty of life.\n\f"}, "001112.png": {"text": "Coach Pete Carroll of the Seattle Seahawks understands the difference between good decisions and good outcomes as well as\nanyone. In February 2015, Carroll made a historic call in the final minutes of Super Bowl XLIX that was immediately criticized as\na huge mistake. The Seahawks trailed 28-24, but they were on New England\u2019s one-yard line and appeared certain to score and take\nthe lead. Lined up in Seattle\u2019s backfield was Marshawn Lynch, a 215-pound battering ram who was arguably the most dominant\nrunning back in the NFL at the time, and who'd already run for more than one hundred yards against the Patriots that day. Here\u2019s\n\na quick recap from a CBS Sports story that explains what happened next\u2014and how Carroll\u2019s decisions continue to be viewed today:\n\nWhat transpired next will live in the annals of this league for as long as football games are played ... a bizarre call by\nCarroll to throw on second down on a route in the crowded middle of the field will be second-guessed just as long\n\u2014fand resulted] in Belichick and Tom Brady, the game\u2019s MVP, making history with their fourth Super Bowl title\n\ntogether.2\n\nTo the fans in the stands and nearly everyone watching the game, the right decision seemed obvious: just hand the ball to \u201cBeast\nMode,\u201d as Lynch was known to many. But instead Carroll asked quarterback Russell Wilson to throw a pass, and the result was a\ndisaster.\n\nIt\u2019s been years since this play. There\u2019s been a tremendous amount of analysis of it. Why didn\u2019t the coach make the easy choice\nthat seemed so clear to everyone else? Based on good information, he was betting against his opponent\u2019s weaknesses. After the\ngame, an interviewer told Carroll, \u201cEveryone is thinking this was the greatest mistake of all time.\u201d Carroll\u2019s response: it was the\n\u201cworst result of a call ever.\u201d His decision-making process was sound. It just didn\u2019t work out. Sometimes that\u2019s life.\n\nThe right call doesn\u2019t always get the intended outcome. Sooner or later everyone who makes decisions in the real world learns\nthis lesson. Poker players know it. They can play their hand perfectly and still lose. Nothing is guaranteed. All you can dois play the\n\nhand you're dealt as best you can.\n\f"}, "001113.png": {"text": "Carroll made his decision on the biggest stage in the world, and it had a terrible outcome. But his confidence in the decision\nwas unwavering. Why? Because he knew the reasons why he had made the call. He knew his logic was sound. All he could do was\nlearn from the outcome.\n\nMany people assume that good decisions get good outcomes and bad ones don\u2019t. But that\u2019s not true. The quality of a single de-\ncision isn\u2019t determined by the quality of the outcome. Here\u2019s a thought experiment that will help illuminate this concept.\n\nImagine you engage in a very thoughtful and intentional decision-making process concerning your career. You have offers\nfrom a few different companies, one being a startup and another a Fortune 500. Based on where you are in your life, you decide to\ngo with the Fortune 500 company. The pay is less up front, but it appears to be more stable.\n\nImagine your friend ends up working for the startup. You watch as he gets raises and more vacation time. Is your decision\ngood or bad?\n\nNow, imagine the startup quickly folds after only a year. Does this affect how you feel about your decision?\n\nThope you get where I\u2019m going with this. You can\u2019t control whether the startup takes off or not. Nor can you control in the\nmoment how you feel about the startup offering higher pay. You can only control the process you use to make the decision. It\u2019s that\nprocess that determines whether a decision is good or bad. The quality of the outcome is a separate issue.\n\nOur tendency to equate the quality of our decision with the outcome is called resulting. Results are the most visible part of a de-\ncision. Because of that, we tend to use them as an indicator of the decision\u2019s quality. If the results are what we wanted, we conclude\nthat we made a good decision. If the results aren\u2019t what we wanted, we tend to blame external factors. It\u2019s not that our process was\nlacking; it\u2019s that a crucial bit of information was. (As opposed to when an acquaintance gets bad results, at which point we assume\nit\u2019s because they made a bad decision.)\n\nObviously, we all want good outcomes, but as we've seen, good decisions can have bad outcomes, and bad decisions can have\ngood ones. Evaluating decisions\u2014ours or others\u2019\u2014based on the outcome (or how we feel about the outcome) fails to distinguish\nluck from skill and control. Because of that, engaging in resulting doesn\u2019t help us get better. The result of resulting is instead\n\nstagnation.\n\f"}, "001114.png": {"text": "If you\u2019ve ever ruminated over a bad outcome\u2014asking yourself again and again, \u201cHow did I not see that coming?\u201d\u2014then you've\nexperienced how challenging and ultimately useless it is to judge your decisions on the basis of how you feel about them in retro-\nspect. You think, \u201cIf only I had talked to that person (whom I didn\u2019t know at the time)!\u201d or, \u201cIf I had only known that piece of infor-\nmation (which didn\u2019t exist at the time), I would have made the right choice.\u201d Even the best decision-makers get bad results from\ntime to time, though.\n\nMaking a good decision is about the process, not the outcome. One bad outcome doesn\u2019t make you a poor decision-maker any\nmore than one good outcome makes you a genius. Unless you evaluate your reasoning at the time you made the decision, you'll\nnever know whether you were correct or just lucky. Your reasoning at that time remains mostly invisible unless you take steps to\nmake it visible.\n\nRarely are you making decisions that have a 100 percent chance of success. And the kind of decision that has a 90 percent\nchance of success still has a bad outcome 10 percent of the time. What matters are results over time and ensuring that 10 percent\n\nof the time won't kill you.\n\f"}, "001115.png": {"text": "The following matrix provides a way of organizing your reflection on decisions and their outcomes.\n\nGood process\n\nBad process\n\nGood outcome\n\nYou make a good decision and things go as planned.

We rarely see other people\u2019s intentions, thinking, or\nprocess, so it\u2019s hard judging their decisions by reference to anything other than their outcomes.\n\nEvaluating our own decisions is different. We can have first-person insight into the process itself. We can examine our think-\ning, distinguish what was within our control from what wasn\u2019t, and what we knew at the time from what we didn\u2019t. We can then\ntake what we've learned and invest it back into our process for next time. Of course, this is easier said than done!\n\nMany of us have a hard time learning from our decisions. One reason is that our thinking and decision-making process is\noften invisible to us. We inadvertently conceal from ourselves the steps we took to reach our final decision. Once that decision gets\nmade, we don\u2019t stop to reflect, but just move forward. And when we look back at our decision later, our ego manipulates our mem-\nories. We confuse what we know now with what we knew at the time we made the decision. And we see the outcomes and read\nthem back into our intentions: \u201cOh, I meant to do that.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t check your thinking at the time you made the decision\u2014what you knew, what you thought was important, and\nhow you reasoned about it\u2014you\u2019ll never know whether you made a good decision or just got lucky.

Trying to\n\nrecall what you knew and thought at the time you made the decision is a fool's game.\n\nYour ego works to distort your memories and convinces you of narratives that make you feel smarter or more knowledgeable than\nyou really are. No one, we think, could make better decisions than the ones we\u2019ve made ourselves. The only way to see clearly what\nyou were thinking at the time you made the decision is to keep a record of your thoughts at the time you were making the decision.\n\nWriting down your thoughts offers several benefits. One benefit is that a written record provides information about your\nthought process at the time you made the decision. It makes the invisible visible. Later, when you reflect on your decision, having\nthat record is helpful for counteracting the distorting effects of the ego default. You can truthfully answer questions like, \u201cWhat\ndid I know at the time I made the decision?\u201d and, \u201cDid the things I anticipated happening come about for the reasons I thought\nthey would?\u201d\n\nAsecond benefit of recording your thoughts is that in the process of writing something, you often realize you don\u2019t really un-\nderstand it as well as you thought you did. It\u2019s far better (and cheaper) to realize this before making your decision instead of after. If\nyou do so in advance, you have an opportunity to get more information and a better grasp of the problem.\n\nA third benefit to writing down your thoughts is that it allows other people to see your thinking, which is mostly invisible.\nAnd if they can see it, they can check it for errors and offer a different perspective that you might otherwise be blind to. If you can\u2019t\nsimply explain your thinking to other people (or yourself), it\u2019s a sign that you don\u2019t fully understand things and need to dig deeper\nand gather more information.\n\nA final benefit to writing down your thoughts is that it gives other people an opportunity to learn from your perspective.

For a week or two you were euphoric. You showed the car off to all your friends and drove it everywhere. You thought life\nwas amazing. Then reality set in. Cars come with problems. In addition to paying for insurance, gas, and maintenance, there\u2019s also\nthe problem of comparison. Back when you didn\u2019t have a car, you used to compare yourself with other people who didn\u2019t have cars.\nBut now that you had a car, you began comparing yourself with other car owners. You noticed who had a better car, and were no\nlonger happy with what had once made you ecstatic. You reverted to your old base-level discontent\u2014the lowest gear on the hedo-\nnic treadmill.

Sometimes it\u2019s about possessions like houses or cars, but more often it\u2019s about status.\n\nWhen | first started working in a large organization, the inner voice in my head told me that if I just got a promotion, I'd be\nhappy. So I worked hard and got the promotion. For a few weeks I felt on top of the world. Then, much like with the car example, re-\nality set in. I had new problems and new responsibilities. Worse, I started comparing myself with a new group of people. It wasn\u2019t\nlong before I reverted to my previous level of discontent. Promotions continued to come, but none of them made me happier. They\nonly left me wanting more.\n\nWe tell ourselves that the next level is enough, but it never is.

The moment they get what they think they want\u2014the \u201cwhen\u201d part of the condi-\ntional\u2014having that thing becomes the new norm, and they automatically want more. It\u2019s as if they\u2019ve walked through a one-way\ndoor that closes behind them. Once the door closes, they lose perspective. They can\u2019t see where they\u2019ve been, only where they are.\n\nThe way things are now is the way we expect them to be, and we start taking the good things around us for granted. Once that\nhappens, nothing will make us happy. And while we're busy running on the treadmill chasing after all the things that won\u2019t make\nus happy, we're not pursuing the things that really matter.\n\nScrooge is a fictional example of achieving \u201csuccess\u201d at the cost of things that really matter. But there are many real examples.\nIonce worked with someone who came to his position running a large company in a way that should be familiar to most of us:\nwith sharp elbows in a hypercompetitive culture. The people he ran into on the way to becoming CEO were only means to help him\nachieve his ends: he wanted to be wealthy, he wanted to be respected, he wanted people to know his name. He wanted status and\nrecognition.\n\nAfter meetings, where things were tense and his temper got the better of him, he would often tell me, \u201cShane, you've got to\ndecide if you're a lion or a sheep. I\u2019m a lion,\u201d he\u2019d say, and quote Tywin Lannister from Game of Thrones: \u201cA lion doesn\u2019t concern\nhimself with the opinions of a sheep.\u201d He wanted everyone to know he was at the top of the food chain.\n\nAn avid golfer, he often enjoyed several games a week. He never had trouble filling a round; in fact, he often complained that he\nhad too many friends and couldn't play with them all. Shortly after retiring, he looked forward to finally having the time to enjoy\nhis favorite pastime with his many friends. As it turned out, though, most of his \u201cfriends\u201d and colleagues were busy, unavailable,\nor stopped returning his calls. He could hardly fill a single round a month.\n\nHis relationships had appeared real and meaningful, but in reality, no one wanted anything to do with him. His transactional\nway of handling other people made them feel used, manipulated, and frustrated. He yelled, cursed, and threw temper tantrums.\nThey worked with him because they had to, not because they wanted to. Golfing was fun for him, but it was work for them.\n\nAwhile after stepping away, he concluded that he\u2019d been trying to win the wrong game.

We value wealth and status more than happi-\nness\u2014the external more than the internal\u2014and we give little thought to how we pursue them.

They were miss-\ning what Scrooge gains at the happy turning point of his story\u2014that ingredient that makes the difference between the unhappy\nmasses and the happy few.\n\nThe ancient Greeks had a word for this ingredient: phronesis\u2014the wisdom of knowing how to order your life to achieve the\nbest results.\n\nWhen you look back to the decisions you made as a teenager, they probably seem pretty silly now. The time you stole (I mean\nborrowed) the car from your parents, the time you got too drunk at a party and maybe did some stuff you shouldn't have (thank-\nfully there were no camera phones back then), the time you got into a fight with a friend over a potential mate.

He\nwas intrigued: \u201cI kept meeting older people\u2014many of whom had lost loved ones, been through tremendous difficulties, and had\nserious health problems\u2014but who nevertheless were happy, fulfilled, and deeply enjoying life. I found myself asking: \u2018What\u2019s that\nall about?\u201d\n\nOne day it hit him: Maybe older people just knew things about living a happy life that younger people didn\u2019t. Maybe they could\nsee things we couldn't see. If any population demographic could lay claim to expertise in living a happy life, it would be seniors. Yet\nto Pillemer\u2019s surprise, no one seemed to have done a study on what practical advice older people had for the younger generation.\nThat set Pillemer off on a seven-year quest to discover \u201cthe practical wisdom of older people.\u201d\n\nTheir number one lesson: life is short! \u201cThe older the respondent,\u201d Pillemer said, \u201cthe more likely [they were] to say that life\n\npasses by in what seems like an instant.\u201d When elders tell younger people that life is short, they\u2019re not being macabre or pes-\n\f"}, "001128.png": {"text": "simistic.

The implications of managing the short time we have on earth are like those of managing\nany scarce resource: you have to use it wisely\u2014in a way that prioritizes what's most important.\n\nWhat were the most important things according to the people Pillemer interviewed? They included the following:\n\n+ Say things now to people you care about\u2014whether it\u2019s expressing gratitude, asking forgiveness, or getting information.\n+ Spend the maximum amount of time with your children.\n\n+ Savor daily pleasures instead of waiting for \u201cbig-ticket items\u201d to make you happy.\n\n+ Work in a job you love.\n\n+ Choose your mate carefully; don\u2019t just rush in.\nThe list of things they said weren't important was equally revealing:\n\n+ None said that to be happy you should work as hard as you can to get money.\n+ None said it was important to be as wealthy as the people around you.\n+ None said you should choose your career based on its earning potential.\n\n+ None said they regretted not getting even with someone who slighted them.\n\nAnd the biggest regret people had? Worrying about things that never happened: \u201cWorrying wastes your life,\u201d one respondent said.\nThese are important insights from the people that Pillemer describes as \u201cthe most credible experts we have on how to live\nhappy and fulfilled lives during hard times.\u201d But there\u2019s another insight that\u2019s even more important.\nPillemer asked one of his interviewees for help understanding the source of her happiness. She thought about it and answered,\n\n\u201cIn my 89 years, I\u2019ve learned that happiness is a choice\u2014not a condition.\u201d\n\f"}, "001129.png": {"text": "According to Pillemer, \u201cThe elders make the key distinction between events that happen to us, on the one hand, and our inter-\nnal attitude toward happiness, on the other. Happy in spite of. Happiness is not a passive condition dependent on external events,\nnor is it the result of our personalities\u2014just being born a happy person. Instead, happiness requires a conscious shift in outlook, in\nwhich one chooses\u2014daily\u2014optimism over pessimism, hope over despair.\u201d\n\nThe more we age, the more we come to see things the way Marcus Aurelius did: \u201cWhen you are distressed by an external thing,\nit\u2019s not the thing itself that troubles you, but only your judgment of it. And you can wipe this out at amoment\u2019s notice.\u201d2\n\nThis insight has dramatic implications. It places happiness on a continuum with other decisions we\u2019ve talked about. Imagine\nthat: all the decisions that make up your career and personal life ultimately add up to an overall decision to be happy. You can\ndecide what to pursue in life. You can decide what\u2019s a priority for you. You can decide to channel your time, energy, and other re-\nsources toward things that really matter in the end.\n\nIf there were a way of viewing things from the perspective of our elders, we might have the insight to live better lives\u2014to see\nin the way the experts do what really matters and what doesn't. In fact, there\u2019s an ancient technique for doing precisely this: start\nthinking about the shortness of life, and it will help you see what really matters.\n\n\u201cLet us prepare our minds as if we had come to the very end of life,\u201d Seneca said.

When\nwe look back at the present through the lens of our life ending, the fears and desires that occupy our attention in the present mo-\n\nment get pushed aside to make room for things that have greater meaning for our lives as a whole. Steve Jobs put the idea this way:\n\nRemembering that I\u2019ll be dead soon is the most important tool I\u2019ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices\nin life. Because almost everything\u2014all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure\u2014these\nthings just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die\n\nis the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking that you have something to lose.\n\nThis shift in our perspective allows us to turn our future hindsight into our current foresight. It gives us a map we can use to\nnavigate into the future. For many of us, looking at life this way reveals that our current direction isn\u2019t fully aligned with where we\nwant to end up. Seeing that is a good thing! Knowing you're heading in the wrong direction is the first step toward getting back on\ncourse. When you get clear on what really matters, you can start asking yourself, \u201cAm I making the right use of my limited time?\u201d2\n\nJobs had a daily ritual. Every morning he would look in the mirror and ask himself, \u201cIf today were the last day of my life, would\nI want to do what I am about to do today?\u201d2 Whenever the answer was no too many days in a row, he said, he knew he needed to\nchange something.

We all have bad days, but when the answer to Job\u2019s question is no day after day, week after week,\nit\u2019s time to make a change.\n\nWhen you did this exercise, you probably thought of your relationships.

I want to have minimized\nthe number of regrets I have.\u201d ... I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried [Amazon].

I posed this question to a friend of mine\nover lunch one day, and he quickly retorted, \u201cI\u2019d spend my savings, run up my credit cards, and start a drug habit.\u201d (He was joking\nabout the drugs. I hope.)\n\nWhen you think of your ninety-year-old self, it becomes clear that running up your credit card or doing drugs isn\u2019t going to\nmake you happier. For many people, considering death makes us less likely to want to blow money.2 (The downside of drugs is, I\ntrust, self-explanatory.) And I\u2019m sure you wouldn't spend your final year checking email, putting other people down, or trying to\nshow your uncle just how right you were that one Thanksgiving when you argued about politics.\n\nWhen you imagine your older self and what you want your life to look like in hindsight, you stop thinking about the small\nthings that encourage you to be reactive instead of proactive. You start to see what actually matters to you. The small things look\nsmall, and the things that really matter start to look big.

It\u2019s not about figuring out how to succeed today but understanding why and how we need to structure our lives\nwith the end in mind.

Your defaults\nencourage you to react without reasoning\u2014to live unconsciously rather than deliberately.\n\nWhen you revert to defaults, you engage in a game you can\u2019t win. When you live a life run on autopilot, you get bad results. You\nmake things worse. You say things that can\u2019t be unsaid and do things that can\u2019t be undone. You might accomplish your immediate\ngoal, but you fail to realize that you\u2019ve made it harder to achieve your ultimate goals. All of this happens without consciously being\naware you are exercising judgment in the first place.\n\nMost books about thinking focus only on being more rational. They miss the fundamental problem: Most errors in judgment\nhappen when we don\u2019t know we're supposed to be exercising judgment. They happen because our subconscious is driving our be-\nhaviors and cutting us out of the process of determining what we should do. You don\u2019t consciously choose to argue with your part-\n\nner, but you find yourself saying hurtful things that can\u2019t be unsaid.

You don\u2019t consciously\nseek to defend your ideas, but you find yourself holding grudges against anyone who criticizes you.\n\nThe key to getting what you want out of life is to identify how the world works and to align yourself with it. Often people think\nthe world should work differently than it does, and when they don\u2019t get the outcomes they want, they try to wiggle out of respon-\nsibility by blaming other people or their circumstances.! Avoiding responsibility is a recipe for misery, and the opposite of what it\ntakes to cultivate good judgment.\n\nImproving your judgment, it turns out, is less about accumulating tools to enhance your rationality and more about imple-\nmenting safeguards that make the desired path the path of least resistance. It\u2019s about designing systems when you're at your best\nthat work for you when you're at your worst. Those systems don\u2019t eliminate the defaults, but they do help you recognize when\nthey are running the show.\n\nManaging your defaults requires more than willpower. Defaults operate at our subconscious level, so overriding them requires\nharnessing equally powerful forces that pull your subconscious in the right direction: habits, rules, and environment. Overriding\nyour defaults requires implementing safeguards that render the invisible visible and that prevent you from acting too soon. And\nit requires cultivating habits of mind\u2014accountability, knowledge, discipline, and confidence\u2014that put you on the right track and\nkeep you there.\n\nThe small improvements you make in judgment won't be felt until they are too large to ignore. Gradually, as the improvements\naccumulate, you will notice that less of your time is spent fixing problems that shouldn't exist in the first place.

I am grateful for our friendship.\n\nCharlie Munger, Warren Buffett, Andrew Wilkinson, Chris Sparling, James Clear, Ryan Holiday, Nir Eyal, Steve Kamb, Michael\n\nKaumeyer, Morgan Housel, Michael Mauboussin, Alex Duncan, Kat Cole, Naval Ravikant, Jim Collins, Tobi Liitke, Annie Duke, Diana\n\f"}, "001141.png": {"text": "Chapman, and Randall Stutman have influenced my thoughts in meaningful ways. In fact, many of their thoughts have so firmly\nembedded themselves in me that they are indistinguishable from my own. To the extent you enjoy this book, you should look all of\nthem up and follow them.\n\nWriting a book is a marathon and not a sprint, and many people helped along the way. Thank you to Ariel Ratner, who got me\nstarted, and to William Jaworski, Ellen Fishbein, and Samuel Nightengale of Writing.coach. They spent so much time editing and\ntransforming my sentences that some sections of the book are as much theirs as mine. Richelle DeVoe and the team at Pen Name\nhelped organize and make real some of the threads in my head. We can all thank Joe Berkowitz for reducing the word count and\ngetting rid of things that didn\u2019t need to be there.\n\nTalso want to thank early readers who provided insight and so much more: Trudy Boyle, Maureen Cunningham, Dr. Setareh\nZiai, Rob Fraser, Zach Smith, Whitney Trujillo, Emily Segal, and Simon Eskildsen. And a big thanks to the team at FS for keeping\neverything going while I was working on this: Vicky Cosenzo, Rhiannon Beaubien, Dalton Mabery, Deb McGee, Laurie Lachance,\nand Alex Gheorghe.\n\nThanks to the team at Portfolio and Penguin Random House who turned this into an actual thing. To the Michael Jordan of\nediting, Niki Papadopoulos, whose insight and patience as I missed every deadline was appreciated. And to my agent Rafe Sagalyn,\nwho was instrumental in guiding me through the publishing process.\n\nAnd... thank you. You've trusted me with something far more valuable than the price of this book; you've trusted me with\nyour time. I hope your investment in the time to read this pays dividends for years to come.\n\nCheers.\n\f"}, "001142.png": {"text": "Is\n\nNotes\n\nChapter 1.1\n\nSee, for instance, Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, second edition, translated by Terence Irwin (Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publish-\ning Company, 1999), pp. 18-19; Seneca's Ad Lucilium Epistulae Morales (Moral Letters to Lucilius], edited by Richard M.

Professional clap-\npers, called a claque, would often be positioned in theaters or opera houses. Claques have been used since at least emperor Nero,\nwhose performances were often applauded by thousands of soldiers. Once a few people start clapping, our social default takes\n\nhold and we find ourselves, much like I did, clapping without knowing why.\nPeter Kaufman reminds me of this all the time.\n\nMost people are chasing complexity. They learn the basics enough to be average, then look for the secret, shortcut, or hidden\n\nknowledge. Mastering the basics is the key to being ruthlessly effective. The basics might seem simple but that doesn\u2019t mean\n\f"}, "001180.png": {"text": "they\u2019re simplistic. The best in the world probably don\u2019t have some secret shortcut or hidden knowledge. They merely under-\nstand the fundamentals better than others. My favorite example of this is Warren Buffett's saying \u201cThe first rule of investing is to\nnever lose money.\u201d Despite the lifetime of wisdom behind it, people dismiss it as too simple. An exercise in thinking comes from\n\nreasoning your way to this insight through first principles from the ground up.\n\nCHAPTER 1.5: The Inertia Default\nfnl Hierarchy is a powerful biological instinct.\n\nfn2 At the time of this writing, the company\u2019s stock price has had a negative return over the past ten years, a period of massive re-\n\nturns of the stock market in general. There is no doubt some luck involved in my selling at the top.\n\nm3 Some fifty years before Newton published his formulation of the law, Descartes summed it up like this: \u201cEach thing, as far as is in\n\nits power, always remains in the same state; and that consequently, when it is once moved, it always continues to move.\u201d\n\nPART 2\n\ninl Removed the word \u201cmen\u201d from the quote.\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: Self-Accountability\nfnl He would go onto become my best friend.\n\nfn2___ sarah Jones Simmer taught me the difference between kind and nice on episode 135 of The Knowledge Project podcast.\n\f"}, "001181.png": {"text": "Self-serving bias is also self-preserving, The self we're preserving is our very sense of self\u2014our identity.\nThe Moral Sayings of Publilius Syrus, 358.
