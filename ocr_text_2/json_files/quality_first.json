Understanding the motivations of people behind a business is a significant\npart of understanding the long-term drive of the company. It all comes down to doing business with people you trust. Trust in\nmanagement is paramount in smaller companies, but still very important when investing in large caps.\n\nI've learned over time that great management teams deliver positive surprises and bad ones negative surprises. And few high-quality\ncompanies have weak management. Conversely, poor businesses typically have the effect of repelling both good management and good\nowners.\n\nWhen it comes to people, the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour. Accordingly, you should judge management by what\nthey do, not what they say. By not rushing into investment decisions and by taking the time to understand a management team, you can\nreduce your risk of misjudging them.\n\nMost errors in assessing managers are made when you see only what you want to see and ignore flaws or warning signs. For example, al-\nways avoid CEOs who hire compensation advisors with expertise in what can be accomplished legally to their benefit and appoint friends\nas patsy directors who will permit the abuse of outside shareholders.\n\nTwo of the biggest mistakes you can make as an investor are to blindly trust management statements and to ignore signs of poor corporate\ngovernance standards. You should take seriously even the slightest doubt over these key areas. That\u2019s why we have incorporated the qual-\nity of the board into the assessment of a management team. Directors hold the keys to arguably the two biggest controllable factors ina\nbusiness - compensation and capital allocation.\n\nbe\n\nTHE FRAMEWORK\n\nThe People rating is based on quantitative scores in seven sub-categories: Business Passion, Execution Capability, Capital Allocation, Investor\n\f"}, "000608.png": {"text": "Communication, Executive Compensation, Ownership Strength, and Board Leadership.\n\nAll of these sub-categories are assessed on five quantitative and qualitative checks. Each is allocated one point if the question can be\nanswered positively; the total number of these points makes up each sub-category\u2019s score on a scale that ranges from 0 to 5, rounded to the\nnearest whole number. If unsure about a question or disclosure is inadequate, the check fails by default. This is consistent with the best\nideas often being the simplest.\n\nEach sub-category also includes a sixth complementary check. These negative questions provide additional information to assist with\ninvestment decision-making, but have no impact on the scoring model.\n\nESG ANALYSIS\n\nTo fully understand companies\u2019 long-term prospects the checklist also covers ESG issues. Analysing these factors is central to measuring\nthe sustainability and ethical impact of an investment in any company. We address the E (environmental) and S (social) factors in \u2018Social\n\nRespon: ity Analysis\u2019.\n\nHowever, in my view the G in ESG should come first. The governance factor shapes companies\u2019 approaches to E and \u00a7, as well as the way\nthat they prioritise development in a world of constant change. In other words, a company\u2019s corporate governance is important to in-\nvestors since it reveals business integrity and direction.\n\nTo examine governance, use the checklists for Board Leadership, Ownership Strength, Executive Compensation and Capital Allocation as\nthese are all crucial components of good corporate governance. The average score for these four supporting sub-categories provides a good\nproxy for governance quality and can help measure the extent to which a board is likely to promote the interests of all shareholders. After\nall, companies are run by human beings. Poorly structured incentives, weak oversight and limited checks on power are very likely to lead\nto poor decision-making at best and something far less pleasant at worst.\n\f"}, "000609.png": {"text": "BUSINESS PASSION ANALYSIS\n\nIS THE CEO PASSIONATE ABOUT THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY?\n\nversely, if you can identify them, you should avoid the \u2018tourist manager\u2019 who is just in it for the glory, passing through on the way\n\nT he hallmark of all truly great business leaders and entrepreneurs is that the business is their life and career, not just a job.

Both qualities that must be combined with tenacity,\nwhich is a necessary ingredient for success because rewards are often far off in the future. That's why a large compensation package will\nnever be as powerful as internal motivation, like following our interests and end up doing what we love for work.\n\nIn the end, most companies end up making money from something other than their original idea. The idea is nothing, whereas passion\nand tenacity are everything. There has to be an energising force. Business biographies tend to show precisely this - how passionate people\nwho live and breathe their business created something out of nothing.\n\nThat's why the ultimate question is; \u201cIs this person going to dedicate his or her life to make something extraordinary happen?\u201d.\n\nCompanies like Alibaba, Amazon, Google, IKEA, Spotify and many others have or had founders who focus relentlessly on pleasing their\ncustomers and thinking about strategies that will impact their companies\u2019 values 10 or 20 years down the road.

Such CEOs are rational long-term\nthinkers who look way ahead and are determined to drive things forward. With a clear vision for the company, they typically invest for\nthe longer term by focusing on what is best for the customer and not just short-term profits. These CEOs act like long-term owners of a\nbusiness, not like caretakers. In other words, long term here means focusing on customer needs over time - both what will change in them\nand what will not.\n\nLong-term thinking and adaptability are two sides of the same coin. CEOs who spend significantly more of their time thinking about the\nlong term and have long-term plans generally excel at adapting to change.

This approach involves finding new pockets of\nvalue in the industry and being creative over time. Such CEOs typically don\u2019t benchmark against their competitors, but rather march to\ntheir own rules by focusing on what customers really want and need and bringing a better product to market. A good example of creativity\ncould be a strategy that adapts a proven business model or idea from another market for their own market.\n\nThese CEOs are often founders and corporate outsiders who bring fresh approaches and perspectives thanks to not being weighed down\nby the traditional industry rules.

They are de-\ntermined to succeed and typically have a strong focus on market leadership, by being the first to offer a product or offering the best one.\n\nCreating something new, improved and more beneficial reflects their dissatisfaction with the status quo. Instead they are focused on\nleading change and innovation to keep their organizations fresh, dynamic and growing. The bottom line is: if they don\u2019t love and believe in\nwhat they are building, they are likely to give up at some point along the way due to the scepticism and setbacks that every business will\ninevitably face.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nListen to interviews with management or, better yet, interview them yourself to assess whether a CEO is obsessed with their business and\nbuilding a great product by focus on customer needs. Does he or she seem enthusiastic about the company and obviously proud of it?\n\nHowever, beware technology-first managers, as they often develop the product they themselves want and avoid engaging with customers.\n\nLook for signs of deep conviction about the problem they are trying to solve for customers.

A collection of intentional decisions, that will provide a context\nfor all decision making. Accordingly, the quality of a management's execution depends a lot on the quality of their strategy. A well-devel-\noped, simple strategy for long-term growth is probably the most important pillar of any business.\n\nManagement should clearly state its long-term plan for how the company is supposed to grow and protect the business against competi-\ntion. The latter is one of the most important tasks for any CEO, to widen the moat of the business.\n\nAt the same time, beware leaders who are satisfied with the status quo, or who tend to be more concerned about survival than growth, as\nthey won't do well over the long run. As the saying goes, \u201cstanding still is going backwards\u201d.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nWhen assessing a strategy\u2019s credibility, the goal is to get a general sense of the direction of value and whether it is positive or negative,\ninstead of trying to quantify the magnitude. Focus on management's key assumptions about the customer's present and future demand\nand how they are going to work closely with them to anticipate and meet their needs. Talk to the company\u2019s competitors because they gen-\nerally will give you a different point of view on the industry and about why some strategies are inferior. That said, it takes time for some\nbusiness models to demonstrate that their strategy will work. Nonetheless, always look out for warning signs of strategy drift.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand the system a business has in place to implement its strategy. A successful strategy must be tailored to what\nthe company says it stands for, how it operates, and its limitations. It should be committed to an identity rather than just focusing on\ngrowth. Otherwise the odds are that the strategy won't work. As investing legend Philip Fisher put it: \u201cMore successful firms usually have\nsome unique personality traits - some special ways of doing things that are particularly effective for their management team. This is a\npositive not a negative sign.\u201d Accordingly, look for companies that embrace their corporate culture rather than attempting to recreate it\nwhen trying something new.\n\nsimilarly, favour companies that invest selectively to be different. However, keep in mind that competitiveness is far more about doing\nwhat customers value than the company\u2019s core competence. Yet picking strategic outcomes that are supposed to bring value to the cus-\nhsomer is exactly where many companies fall short. Always ask what the most important factors are in winning customers to understand\nhow the company is trying to differentiate itself. Is it price, quality or customer service?\n\nA questionable strategy is one that is difficult to understand or seems to have no prospect of creating value, neither creating defensibility\nnor connecting to the company\u2019s culture and limitations.

Look for a manager with a history of creating long-term value for shareholders,\nwhether at the current company or in the same industry.\n\nLong-term value often manifests itself in the trend of market share.

The bottom line is that what goes on in the personal lives of CEOs can matter to the company.\n\nThe fact that negative life events like illness, bereavements, divorce, alcohol/drug abuse or financial problems often have a negative impact\non the business, due to their stress and emotional pain, should be of great interest to investors. Think about the impact on focus, on behav-\niour, and on the CEO's attitude towards risk. A distracted CEO could harm long-term decision-making and cause the company to miss out\non potential opportunities.\n\nFor example, in a divorce the CEO may not have the cognitive capacity to focus. Their energy may be sapped. They may also be at risk of\nlosing a large portion of their wealth. If so, the incentive plan may go out the courthouse window. It\u2019s not uncommon for divorced CEOs to\nresign for one reason or another within a year or two of their divorce.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nThe difficulty for investors who might want to understand this risk is that their interest in this kind of information runs directly counter\nto the CEO's right to personal privacy. However, following the news will probably do the work for you as these kinds of development tend\nto leak out.\n\nAnother way to getting a sense of what's going on with the CEO\u2019s primary non-work interests like family, health and hobbies is to track\nsocial media platforms. These can be a great way of gaining insight into somebody\u2019s areas of interest outside work.\n\nStill, CEOs are seldom active on social media platforms. Accordingly, you might have to do some channel checks too.

In other words, companies need products that are unique or offered in a distinctive way\nto justify high profit margins, but also defensibility to protect those high profits. In other words, in businesses with no sustain-\nable competitive advantages, new inventions help customers save money. In businesses with sustainable competitive advantages, new in-\nventions help the bottom-line (and the owners by extension).\n\nFor more on defensibility through sustainable competitive advantages, also called moats, please read the \u2018Proxy Guide: Competitive Moats\u2019.\n\nStrategy is the series of choices made about where to play and how to win to maximize long-term value. It\u2019s as much about choosing what\nto do as it is choosing what not to do. There are basically two choices when it comes to strategies:\n\n1. Aim to dominate the entire industry or, target a market segment in which the company can excel (e.g., regional and/or niche\nmarket);\n\n2. Offer bargain prices or the best customer relationship or win by marketing superior products (see \u2018Differentiation Strategy\u2019\nbelow).\n\nEvaluating a management team\u2019s strategy in the context of these choices will give an idea of the company\u2019s future performance. Keep in\nmind that a corporate strategy should be simply explained, not overloaded with unnecessary information. The latter can reveal leaders\nlacking in strategic confidence.\n\nYet, strategy is typically something that evolves over time as smart managers are responsive to their markets and as their customers\ndevelop. It is essentially the idea that a company can craft the conditions to create durable returns for its shareholders to get long periods\nof outsized returns. However, as Richard Rumelt explains in his great book Good Strategy Bad Strategy: \u201cFortunately, a leader does not need\nto get it totally right - the organisation's strategy merely has to be more right than those of its rivals.\u201d Successful strategies often owe as\nmuch to the inertia of competitors as to the strategy itself.\n\f"}, "000626.png": {"text": "Generally speaking, the most successful growth companies are more specialised, have stronger differentiators and pursue a narrower cus-\ntomer base than their more average peers.\n\nFor example, when a business tries to appeal strictly to a niche market rather than the masses, it will typically benefit in a number of ways:\npremium prices, lower costs of acquiring customers, and the opportunity to become the brand that consumers associate with the offering\nitself. This partly happens because it provides more value to customers than other players through greater knowledge and expertise about\nthe niche. That\u2019s why the quality of a business is determined in a broad sense by the quality of its customers.\n\nDIFFERENTIATION STRATEGY\n\nThere are basically three ways to differentiate a business from the competition - superior product, outstanding customer relationship, or\nlowest cost. Customers know how to identify these types of value and generally don\u2019t expect to get them all from a single supplier. Market\nleaders typically create a true difference in one value discipline while remaining competitive in the two others. Moreover, customers are\ngenerally more loyal to companies with superior product or best relationship than to those with lowest prices, so quality is the better way\nto go if the company has a choice.\n\nProduct leadership\n\nThis involves putting technology to new uses, inventing new products, or focusing on user-friendliness by best-in-class R&D. The latter\nensures that the pace of innovation is high (relative to competitors), which creates a virtuous cycle of the strong getting stronger. Rational\n(but genuine) innovation makes all the difference as long as the company stays one step ahead of the competition as they attempt to copy\nits success. This includes actual physical and perceived differences, like a unique feature or reputation of being superior.\n\nCommon Moat Sources: Network Effects, Special Assets and Brand Loyalty.\nCustomer closeness\n\nThis involves focusing on the customer more than anything else by being responsive to their pain points, needs, and desires in order to\ndeliver the \u2018best total solution\u2019. Some make this a true benefit, to best serve customer needs and offer convenience and efficiency. Success\ndepends on a niche market focus and strong sales force with appropriate targeting, efficient management of customer relationships, and\ntailored offers. This is particularly valuable for complex products where the salesperson acts as an advisor, as it typically includes all sup-\nporting elements such as training, installation and easy ordering. However, it is trickier to maintain customer intimacy at scale.\n\nCommon Moat Sources: Switching Costs and Brand Loyalty.\n\f"}, "000627.png": {"text": "Low-cost provider\n\nProducts positioned in line with the market average, at the best price, with a minimum of hassle (ie, reliable product or speedy service).\nThe low-cost provider's product range is simple above all as costs are slashed by cutting out elements that don\u2019t address the needs of the\nmajority. Moreover, cost leadership is critical to success, something that comes from having large scale and operational excellence.\n\nCommon Moat Sources: Scale Economies and Process Power.\n\nFinally, operational excellence is a prerequisite to succeeding with any differentiation strategy over time, but does not by itself assure\ndifferential margins. That is to say, operational excellence is not a strategy in itself as competitors can often easily imitate the improve-\nments yielded by it, eventually arbitraging out the value to the business. Pursuing operational excellence is simply an ongoing process of\nimprovement to become better at the things that make the business profitable and valuable today.\n\nThe bottom line is that companies should try to be unique instead of trying to be the best at something. In other words, when it comes to\nstrategy, focus should be on invention and then building competitive moats around it. The first cause of a strategy is always invention.\n\nInnovation means reacting to trends or shifts much faster than competitors in order to stay different. It\u2019s about reacting to significant\nstructural changes in the industry\u2019s economics or customer behaviour. It involves taking advantage of new technologies, business models\nor using existing ideas in a new way, whether as an early-stage company or a mature company considering a new direction.\n\nNonetheless, there are also rare times when no new opportunities have developed and no new risks have appeared. Here doing more of the\nsame may be the most reasonable strategy.\n\nGROWTH STRATEGY\n\nFor CEOs to win the support of their board and investors, they need the ability to develop and explain how their strategy can scale up - not\njust how they will differentiate their business to survive. In this sense the goal for growth should be for the largest number of customers\npossible to enjoy the product on offer without diluting its competitive advantages.\n\nStill, the objective of sound growth is not only to make gains, but to build defensibility through sustainable competitive advantages. With-\nout the latter, high returns cannot be protected over time and growth will create little or no value. It will merely be a commodity business,\nbecause as soon as the growth in demand slows down, the profits will vanish. In other words, a competitive advantage that isn't sustain-\nable will merely be an opportunistic window of time for the business.\n\f"}, "000628.png": {"text": "For example, strategies that focus on market share alone typically come at a high cost as they often erode profit margins and competitive\nadvantages while their offerings become commoditized. High levels of capital spending and rapid increases in market share, often as re-\nsult of deal mania, are tell-tale signs of a management racing out of control.\n\nAll the same, companies pursuing high growth tend to follow three well known strategies:\n(1) Serving broader stakeholder needs;\n\n(2) Creating new markets;\n\n(3) Changing the rules of the game.\n\nThe best opportunities for growth are those that are focused on core or related markets (complementary products for example) where the\ncompany\u2019s existing competitive moats may give it a defence against competition. The next-best growth opportunities come from entering\nvirgin markets with no dominant player enjoying sustainable competitive advantages, to fulfil a yet unmet demand. This avoids price\nwars from head-on competition with established players as it\u2019s incredibly difficult to replicate all of industry leaders\u2019 natural advantages \u2014\nfrom brand loyalty to customers and assets. The third best growth opportunity comes from changing the game entirely in an established\nmarket through disruption. The latter two are key when a company\u2019s growth potential is limited within its core markets.\n\nTo succeed in changing the rules of the game it naturally takes a counter-positioning strategy that involves innovation of a new, superior\nbusiness model that established competitors does not adopt due to anticipated cannibalisation of their existing business. This business\nmodel, by itself, constitutes a competitive moat -a special asset. Nonetheless, a counter-positioning strategy tends to first target lower-\nend customers or lower-feature products with a seemingly inferior product and then evolve to be good enough for high-end users. Also,\na successful counter-positioning strategy typically involves a different organisation with different people, world view and compensation\nstructures compared to the established competitors.\n\nThe idea of a counter-positioning strategy is discussed in detail by Hamilton Helmer in his remarkable book 7 Powers: The Foundations of\nBusiness Strategy, which I recommend highly.\n\f"}, "000629.png": {"text": "CAPITAL ALLOCATION ANALYSIS\n\nDOES MANAGEMENT APPEAR TO USE SHAREHOLDERS MONEY WELL?\n\nne of management's most important jobs is to allocate capital with the objective of building long-term value per share. Success-\nful capital allocation means converting inputs, including money, things, ideas, and people, into something more valuable than\nthey would be otherwise. Simply put, capital allocation is the link between business value and shareholder value.\n\nOne benefit of investing in a management team with great capital allocation skill is that you can thrive in market downturns. Value cre-\nation in these companies can come from share repurchases or organic growth in market share or compelling acquisitions.\n\nBasically, CEOs have five choices for deploying capital - investing in existing operations, acquiring other businesses, paying dividends,\npaying down debt, or repurchasing stock \u2014 and three alternatives for raising it- tapping internal cash flow, issuing debt, or raising equity.\n\nThe best way of assessing managers\u2019 skill in capital allocation is to review whether their decisions have improved earnings per share over\ntime. If the chairman and CEO are long tenured, it's easier to imagine that future capital allocation will be similar to past capital allocation.\nIfa CEO has been running a company for decades, a look at the long-term stock chart should suffice.\n\nThe best CEOs tend to be the ones who regard capital allocation as their most important task. Yet, most companies pay little attention to it\ndue to inexperience in capital markets and corporate finance. Most CEOs get the top job because of operational excellence, corporate poli-\ntics or other skills that have nothing to do with allocating capital.

Does the company lack a sound dividend payout policy?\n\n1. Do the company\u2019s incentive plans encourage long-term value creation?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThis check offers an assessment of whether the incentives a company has in place encourage judicious capital allocation. Incentives\nmatter when managers choose between optimising the appearance of accounting and maximising the present value of future cash flows.\nManagers who are paid handsomely to misallocate capital will do so.\n\nThe objective of capital allocation is to build long-term value per share in the belief that investors will ultimately follow value. If the mar-\nket fails to reflect it, management can take action by sharpening communication or buying back stock.\n\nIncentive programs frequently encourage behaviour that is not in the best interest of long-term shareholders. Misaligned incentives tend\nto manifest themselves in bad decision-making and value destruction. Large bonuses and stock options have been held responsible for\noverly risky behaviour and short-term strategies.\n\nFor example, if remuneration is roughly correlated with the size of the company, management may do value-destroying M&A deals to\ngrow. This could lead to a debt-fuelled buying spree, leaving a hole in the company\u2019s balance sheet. As Howard Marks advocates, we must\nbe sure to give adequate attention to second-order effects.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nIn order for an incentive plan to reward long-term performance, it must tie compensation to results over a time period of at least five years.\nWhere there are mitigating factors that would justify a shorter performance period, these need to be carefully explained to shareholders.\n\f"}, "000631.png": {"text": "Given that the average CEO stays barely five years in the role, there is typically a mismatch between their aims and those of shareholders.\nThat is why long-term schemes of at least five years that move beyond tenure period are preferable. These do not incentivise inappropriate\nrisk-taking or create adverse, unintended long-term consequences.\n\nAgood complementary sign is a significant length of deferral of variable pay. This should apply not just to annual bonuses, but also long-\nterm incentive plans. Companies should explain any mitigating factors that may justify not deferring variable pay.\n\nEqually, they should minimise \u2018cliff-edge\u2019 vesting. Sliding scales starting from suitably low levels of initial payment are preferable.\n\nSignificant incentive awards should only be made for exceptional performance where strong performers are differentiated from average\nperformers. Performance targets should be sufficiently challenging so that senior managers rarely receive 100% of their potential bonus\nentitlement, unless they have been truly exceptional. Likewise, a good rule of thumb is for 50% of the incentives to be based on profits and\n50% on underlying business targets reflecting strategic objectives.\n\nIf management focuses on delivering strong cash flows and re-allocating capital sensibly, the share price typically looks after itself. Ac-\ncordingly, the ideal compensation structures are those that reward long-term value creation. That\u2019s why the ultimate incentive plans are\nthose that replace long-term incentive pay with a requirement that executives own a multiple of their annual salary in company stock (or\npay bonuses in the form of restricted stock) and hold it for long periods of time. For more on ownership, please read question number two\n\u2018Does the management team own a significant stake in the business?\u2019 in the Ownership Strength checklist.\n\nIn cases where management lacks sufficient \u2018skin in the game\u2019 you should look for good value creation factors or business targets. These\nshould focus on operational drivers (key performance indicators) like cost control, customer satisfaction, and return on capital - the met-\nrics which dictate the business's success or failure. Such indirect incentives should stop managers from focusing too much on short term\nshare price movements.\n\nAccording to Warren Buffett, a good incentive plan \u201cshould be (1) tailored to the economics of the specific operating business; (2) simple\nin character so that the degree to which they are being realized can be easily measured; and (3) directly related to the daily activities of the\nplan participants.\u201d\n\nSuccess measures like market share, accounting income, sales, absolute growth and EBITDA are all considered to be poor proxies for value\ncreation. For example, an excessive focus on sales growth could result in a willingness to sacrifice margins to generate incremental growth\n\u2018at any cost\u2019. Likewise, if expansion of market share is the only thing that matters, it is easy to sacrifice profitability or cash flow along the\nway to achieve that end.\n\nExamples of poor incentives are option awards or other traditional bonus structures that provide managers with upside rewards without\ndownside risks in the event of poor performance.

Do investments and acquisitions focus on strengthening the core business?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nSuccessful companies typically stick with what they know best and strengthen their core businesses and competitive advantages rather\nthan engage in conglomerate building. Such companies only acquire companies that are closely related and can offer clear synergies.\nThese bolt-on acquisitions generally have higher success rates than bigger transformational M&A transactions. Put simply, these compa-\nnies try to stick to what they are good at.\n\nBecause management is under pressure to grow and put the best spin on their uniqueness to exploit opportunities, it is not uncommon for\ninvestors to be led into over-optimistic conclusions about the prospects of new investments. For most declining businesses, management\ntends to redeploy cash flow into things outside of their core competencies, to \u2018diversify\u2019 as a desperate attempt in the pursuit of growth.\nsuch compromises and inconsistencies will erode a company\u2019s distinct positioning by becoming all things to all customers.\n\nThe bottom line is that investing for low returns, either through acquisitions or expanding into lower return areas, can undermine the\noverall quality of the business. The erosion of longer-term returns for the sake of short-term profit gains will eventually lead to the perma-\nnent destruction of shareholder wealth.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nMake sure that the company is reinvesting enough (keeping R&D up) at a proven rate of return to stay competitive. Equally, though, be\nvigilant that any investment and acquisition strengthens the competitive advantage of the core business or fills a strategic gap. The latter\ncould be access to new territories, product segments or technologies or help to achieve growth or critical mass by way of increasing mar-\nket share.\n\nAlways be very cautious towards management teams that are more concerned with growing bigger than using acquisitions to create more\nvalue for the company and its shareholders. Sometimes business transformation is necessary because the underlying market is changing\nin a way which is both rapid and unforeseen. Yet, in most cases risky transformational projects can be avoided if management is visionary\nand keeps the company evolving towards where it needs to be in five to 10 years.\n\nIn contrast, serial acquirers (also known as M&A compounders), do rather small and often private deals rather than \u2018transformative\u2019 public\ndeals. Acquisitions of small private companies tend to be priced more favourably than public companies and generate much better returns\n~ especially when the deals are done through direct contact with sellers to avoid auctions. Small acquisitions also imply lower risk for the\nbuyer. In addition, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that multiple acquisitions also build capabilities. For serial acquirers, acquisitions are a sys-\ntematic process at the core of the strategy.\n\f"}, "000634.png": {"text": "For any acquisition to succeed it\u2019s critical that management understands the business they are acquiring intimately. This explains why\nvertical deals are seldom successful. For this reason, it is particularly worrying if the acquired company serves different customers or\ndoesn't fit into the core competency of the business. And even more so if the customers and employees don\u2019t remain with the acquired\nbusiness.

A real tick in the box in\nfavour of the management being a good capital allocator, would be if they can create shareholder value even though an investment or ac-\nquisition isn\u2019t panning out as hoped.\n\nDivestments (spin-offs) of small non-core businesses are another way for companies to strengthen their core businesses. Yet for most\nmanagers it\u2019s an unnatural act to shrink their prestige and span of control by spinning off and selling businesses. By the time it becomes\nclear to them that divestment is the best course of action, shareholders have often been asking for it for years.\n\nIf investments and acquisitions have tended to strengthen the company\u2019s competitive advantages and core business, the stock is scored\none point.\n\f"}, "000635.png": {"text": "3.

It includes a history of raising capital opportunistically, repurchasing stock at low valuations, and using a high-priced stock as a\ncurrency to make acquisitions.\n\nThis typically means that the company is exhibiting counter-cyclical behaviour and patience by accumulating cash to be able to strike\nwhen things are cheap. In other words, it looks to invest when competitors are not and vice versa.\n\nActing opportunistically and not overpaying for things implies that management has a clear sense of what their assets are worth and is\nwilling to act on that knowledge. Whether that means buying or selling, the difference between value and price should always guide man-\nagement decisions.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nThe bottom line is that competent capital allocators usually take on more debt and deploy additional cash (instead of hoarding it) during a\nrecession when good opportunities arise. They are typically opportunistic in taking advantage of a high or low-priced stock in three ways:\n\nFundraising: In fundraising, share dilution is probably the biggest risk to investors. That\u2019s why it's so important to raise capital oppor-\ntunistically when one can, rather than when one must, to minimise the dilution in earnings per share. Be on the lookout for CEOs who\nseem to regularly undertake financings that are more dilutive than similarly situated peer companies.\n\nWatch out for badly structured financing vehicles, like convertibles, rights issues and warrants that are based on the market price at the\ntime of conversion or exercise. Such structures tend to be too dilutive and encourage \u2018pump and dump\u2019 behaviour - something that is com-\nmon among financially distressed companies that have to resort to rescue financing by issuing new shares in a crisis situation.\n\nAcquisitions: Market conditions play a significant role in M&A transactions. When an acquirer's shares are considered overvalued, man-\nagement may prefer to pay for the acquisition through a share exchange. The shares are essentially a form of currency.\n\n \n\nHowever, beware executives who pay \u2018strategic\u2019 prices for acquisitions. Big companies typically acquire start-ups early in their growth to\n\nstay at the cutting edge of technology, particularly when the quest for growth pushes them outside their zone of core competence.\n\nIn general, acquisitions that create value through improved efficiencies of the merged organisation should not be attributed to capital\nallocation skill.

Also keep in mind that dividends are taxed on receipt, whereas the tax on the capital gains resulting from share buy-\nbacks is deferred until the investor sells.\n\nIf the company has a share repurchase program in place, it\u2019s good if management communicates a commitment to buy only at a particular\nprice or valuation.

This reflects management's confidence in future earnings growth.\nCompanies with a sound dividend policy have clear dividend policies in place with consistent track records and rational payout ratios rela-\ntive to others in the industry.\n\nPaying out dividends forces companies to be more stringent on their use of capital as dividends are real cash outlays for companies that\ncan\u2019t be restated. Also, once companies start paying dividend, they are reluctant to stop or cut dividends since it can drive the stock price\ndown and reflect poorly on management's abilities. Yet dividends are not normatively good if the business is funded poorly or if there are\nbetter uses for the money.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nAny company that intends to distribute a portion of its annual earnings should have an announced dividend policy that is outlined in\nits annual report. Every company should revisit its dividend policy from time to time. Doing so can greatly improve the strategy debate\namong a company\u2019s senior managers.\n\nBelow are some quality criteria to consider when evaluating the dividend payout policy:\n\nClear: Dividend policies should always be clear to reduce shareholders\u2019 uncertainty. Basically, this involves explaining what share of earn-\nings will be paid out as dividends each year. This is known as the payout ratio.\n\nHaving a clear dividend policy is generally good governance. It gives investors a better understanding of the business they are investing in\nand what to expect.\n\nIt is much easier for a fixed income fund manager to manage their portfolio when they know the dividend policy of each company in the\nportfolio. After all, these funds are also committed to declare a certain amount of dividend for their owners.\n\nConsistent: Companies that pay consistent dividends, are generally trying to increase them annually and cutting them very reluctantly.\nConsistency is key when comparing the numbers over the past few years. Yet dividend growth can be more difficult for companies with a\nhigh payout ratio unless earnings growth is strong.\n\nInvestors don\u2019t like surprises. A special dividend, while nice in the moment, creates confusion for long-term investors. This is typically the\nresult of a dividend policy not being in place, with payouts being instead set by the board in an ad hoc way and approved by the annual\ngeneral meeting. This will confuse owners and drive away would-be investors as it makes them less likely to stick to a strategy with divi-\ndend-paying stocks.\n\f"}, "000640.png": {"text": "Rational: Several considerations go into interpreting if the payout ratio is rational, most importantly the company's level of maturity. A\ngrowth-oriented company that aims to expand, develop new products, and move into new markets would be expected to reinvest most or\nall of its earnings and could be forgiven for having a low or even zero payout ratio.\n\nIfa company can generate high returns on reinvested earnings (>15%) then it should reinvest it, or make value-enhancing acquisitions,\nor buy back stock at cheap levels, rather than pay its earnings out as dividends. The value of such companies compounds at a much higher\nrate than if the earnings were paid out to investors as dividends. Even so, dividends are often prioritized by investors and pundits.\n\nIn the end, investors should seek to maximise their total return, not yield. The reality is that dividends are the route to average returns.\nThose who want a dividend can effectively generate dividend-type wealth by selling shares instead. Thomas Phelps said it best in his book\n100 to 1 in the Stock Market: \u201cWhen you buy a cow to milk don't plan to race her against your neighbour's horse.\u201d\n\nPaying out capital through dividends only makes sense if the company lacks great opportunities to put it to work. This can even be\nconsidered value-destructive if the payment is effectively financed by debt or equity. The latter is the reason a company with no earnings\nshouldn\u2019t pay dividends. However, when companies with poor capital allocators retain a very high proportion of earnings there is a great\ntendency for poor investments to be made, which subsequently leads to poor earnings growth and return on equity.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to expect different payout ratios from different industries. Cyclical and capital-intensive businesses and those with significant\nvalue-enhancing investment opportunities should pay out a smaller percentage of earnings compared to companies in defensive indus-\ntries or those with fewer reinvestment opportunities. The key is to gauge the payout ratio over a business cycle and in relation to industry\npeers.\n\nApayout ratio above 70% is generally irrational as it might mean the company is failing to reinvest enough of its profits in the business to\ngrow. Also, if business trends unexpectedly fall, there might not be enough profits to keep paying the dividend. A high payout ratio often\nmeans the company\u2019s earnings are faltering or that it is trying to entice investors who find little else to get excited about.\n\nIf the company lacks a dividend payout policy or if the policy is considered unsound, this check is flagged.\n\nThis factor has a zero-weight impact on the scoring model for People and is included as additional information to assist with investment\ndecision-making.\n\f"}, "000641.png": {"text": "INVESTOR COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS\n\nIS COMMUNICATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS OPEN AND HONEST?\n\nkey factor is the attitude of management towards shareholders.

They\nguide employees in making moral and practical decisions.\n\nHowever, what is written in a statement of values is of little importance unless those values are reflected in how the company operates.\nPeople act with integrity when their words and actions are aligned - culture lives in the way things get done.\n\n \n\nAs the industrialist Andrew Carnegie once said, \"The older I get, the less I listen to what someone says, and the more I watch what they do.\"\nThe bottom line is that a company\u2019s culture is highly important as it is one of the most stable aspects over time.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nCulture always starts at the top.

And over\ntime, employees self-select into or out of a culture.\n\nTo find meaningful statements of company values you have to look at executive communications and shareholder letters for engaging\nstories that describe how the company\u2019s history and strategies have been shaped by its values.

This is particularly true\nwhen they answer questions about important aspects of the business.\n\nWhen great managers encounter complex concepts, they do their best to educate investors about them by providing discussion of and\ninsight into what they mean. Similarly, they explain clearly to investors how the business is operating and try to make sure market expec-\ntations are reasonable in the light of current information. The point is that people trust what they know and understand.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nAsign of good shareholder communication is when all get the same level of information promptly at the same time and explained in a way\nthat anyone can understand. If you find it difficult to listen to managers or reading what they write, there's something wrong. You don't\nwant managers employing complicated or non-standard terminology, but rather words and numbers that are easy to understand. When it\ncomes to the financial statements, they should try to guide investors and explain what to look for.\n\nAsign of poor communication with shareholders is when in response to some concern, statements become longer, less specific and more\nambiguous. It can seem as if the impact of every word has been weighed, checked and reconsidered before it has been committed to paper.\nTypically, this means long on detail but short on insight.\n\nIn contrast, when all is going well, company statements are clear and concise.\n\nAtip when analysing shareholder letters is to start reading and highlight all clich\u00e9s such as \u201cemployees are our greatest assets\u201d, \u201cour future\nis bright\u201d and \"our financial strength.\u201d This kind of meaningless jargon and platitudes diminishes anyone\u2019s understanding of the business\nand trust in the leadership.\n\nIf you see too much fluff, or more highlighted text than black ink on the pages, it is a warning sign.

After all, if the company's long-term goals and high-level strategy change every few years, how can anyone\nhave an idea about where the company will be in five or 10 years\u2019 time. To put it simply, a business is at great risk when leaders lose their\nfocus.\n\nYou should always worry about companies if the script changes.

Long-term financial objectives could be major drivers of income such as volume targets, rev-\nenue targets, or major operating costs.\n\n\u2018An over-promotional management team is never a good thing as they are managing expectations rather than managing businesses.\nUltimately, a hard sell usually indicates that some form of financing is on the way.

Over-pro-\nmotional managements are also more likely to be involved in frauds.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nYou can tell by management's actions.

The presence of a large non-manage-\nment shareholder on the board of directors typically means better performance. Such companies are generally better governed, pay their\nexecutives more rationally, and the stock typically outperform companies that have no such \u2018principal\u2019 minding the business.\n\nEven if the threat of takeovers and hedge fund activism can have a healthy disciplinary effect on managers, the cost of these efforts is so\nhigh that they will always be rare.

Does the management team own a significant stake in the business?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nCompanies are generally more likely to prosper when management has a meaningful ownership stake. A high insider ownership is prob-\nably the best protection against fraud, It ensures that they think primarily as owners, not as employees. Typically, a management team\nwith sizable equity ownership retain a long-term perspective for the company, resulting in more prudent operational and capital alloca-\ntion decisions as they are more likely to explore every alternative before considering a dilutive equity offering. As Nassim Taleb points out\nin his book Skin in The Game; \u201cWhat matters isn\u2019t what a person has or doesn\u2019t have; it is what he or she is afraid of losing.\u201d\n\nOne thing you can generally count on is that managers will behave (despite what they say) in a way that maximises their own wealth. If\nthe stake is too small, ownership becomes more of a symbolic gesture. Then pay and bonuses play a bigger role than their shareholding in\nhow they can personally make or lose money on the company\u2019s performance.\n\nManagers that own little or no stock in their company make decisions differently than if they owned a significant stake. This difference\nmay manifest itself in extravagant office furniture, lavish hotels and fancy business cards. It\u2019s the difference between careless spending\nand conservative budgeting. In other words, a management team that doesn\u2019t own the business rents the business. They use it how they\nwant and treat capital discipline and shareholders as an afterthought because their own money isn't at stake.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nThe key is that the managers own enough to care, and to shun those companies in which managers are in a position to \u2018free-ride\u2019 off share-\nholders without putting any of their own capital at risk. Of course, the bigger the company, the less significant each person's holdings are.\n\nA good complementary sign is if the mangers view frugality as a source of pride. The company headquarters can send the message that\neach buck counts as it ultimately belongs to the shareholders.\n\nIf management as a group owns 5% or more of equity or a majority of senior managers own shares with a value of five times or more their\nbase salary, the stock is scored one point. Unvested shares in incentive arrangements should not count towards the total.\n\nnore: While high insider ownership can mean that incentives are aligned to shareholders\u2019 benefit, in some situations it may also become a\ndeterrent for institutional shareholder participation, since they will find it difficult to trade large quantities of stock. Also, a limited float\nmakes management immune to potential shareholder action.

Does the company have a controlling owner with long-term commitment?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThis check evaluates if the company is backed by financially strong investors with long-term commitment to the business. Having a cash-\nrich promoter family or parent company that can and will back long-term initiatives with cash and provide additional capital during pe-\nriods of stress is a good sign. Moreover, academics have found that stocks of companies with controlling shareholders, including families,\noutperform those with dispersed ownership.\n\nControlling owners typically avoid excessive leverage and use retained earnings rather than serial equity offerings to grow. Also, inde-\npendent thinking is easier in companies with dominant shareholders. These features insulate against pressure from both rivals and stock\nmarkets, as they typically focus on long-term value creation.\n\nIdeally, the controlling owners are active with board positions and deep experience in some aspect of the market. Maybe they have worked\nwith these same customers in another context, or they have deep expertise with the technology, or they have built a very similar business\nin an adjacent market.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nCarefully examine the controlling owners\u2019 objectives for the company, their finances and their dealings so that you can know as far as\npossible what lies ahead. A controlling owner is defined for the purpose of this rating as a shareholder or group of shareholders (a family,\nfor example) that controls at least 20% of the company\u2019s board seats, with a minimum of two, and has done so for a period of more than\nthree years.\n\nAcontrolling shareholder at imminent risk of high indebtedness and who may be forced to sell its holdings is not a stable owner. This also\napplies to owners who lack the financial muscle to back up long-term initiatives with cash when no one else will. In both cases, the owner-\nship structure is at risk of being undermined.\n\nBeware those companies where the major owners don't support growth by not investing in a new issue.

Companies where the founder still has long-term ownership ambitions typically act genera-\ntional in their capital allocation perspective.

One apparent explanation for an owner discount is that the\nprincipal shareholder has, or can be suspected of having, interests other than maximising the value of the company, i.e. that power is more\nimportant than return. If the principal shareholder considers the company its own, there is a great risk that minority shareholders will be\nignored,\n\nYou should be extra observant of companies with a second class of stock with super-voting rights, large family or insider ownership, or\nlarge government ownership positions. Any of these can have a meaningful impact on executive decisions on capital allocation.\n\nAnother obvious case where the principal shareholder's interests diverge from those of other shareholders are companies where the prin-\ncipal shareholder is looking to take over the company entirely.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nAsk yourself if the principal shareholders\u2019 interests have led to value-destructive decisions. A bad sign is if the company's major or con-\ntrolling owners have a poor reputation associated with unethical behaviour or profit previously reaped at the expense of minority owners.\nYou will find opinion pieces by searching for phrases like \u2018<Company name> fraud\u2019.\n\nAnother example is found in companies dominated by a founding family in which there is reason to suspect that the family retaining con-\ntrol is an end in itself. This is particularly true in cases where family members are perceived as shoe-ins for key positions in the company\neven though they are not qualified for these jobs.

Despite their commitment to active ownership, their work with portfolio\ncompanies is exit-driven and temporary, with the goal of divesting their investments within the foreseeable future (usually 5-10 years).\nUncertainty always ensues when an owner that clearly wants to exit does not have an obvious successor, which often has a negative im-\npact on venture capital-owned companies in the lead-up to an IPO.

In turn, this\nmay imply a higher cost of capital on future fund raising.\n\nDual-class shares help the founders and management focus on the long-term growth of the company instead of immediate financial\nreturn.

Does the chairman serve on an excessive number of outside boards?\n\n1. Is a majority of the board composed of genuinely independent directors?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThe proportion of independent directors on a board is viewed by many as critical to firm performance. This question addresses whether\nmembers of the board are subject to control by others. Generally, a board lacking a majority of independent members will raise significant\nconcerns. The largest frauds in corporate history have typically involved board members whose interests were more clearly aligned with\nmanagement than shareholders.\n\nIndependent members of the board are less apt to be \u2018yes men\u2019. Directors with ties to management may be less willing or able to effectively\nevaluate and scrutinize company strategy and performance. Furthermore, boards without adequate independence from management\nmay have other inherent conflicts of interest.\n\nAlso, there needs to be a balance between board refreshment, board stability, and the importance of some long-tenured directors toa\ncompany\u2019s success. Governance is only one part of a director's role and concern about extended board tenures and a preference for board\nrefreshment can do more harm than good (see note below). Therefore, director tenure is an issue that is best left to boards to address\nindividually.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nLook out for conflicts of interests between board members and the CEO found in the Related Party section of the proxy statement.

The latter should be accompanied by checking up the board members that have\ncome to the business during the CEO\u2019 s tenure.\n\f"}, "000672.png": {"text": "Typically, the CEO plays an important role in bringing board members in. If all of the directors were brought to the company by the CEO,\nit\u2019s fair to ask the CEO how confident an investor should be of the board\u2019s capacity to monitor their performance independently (one of the\nprincipal roles of all boards).\n\nFor Redeye to determine whether an appointed director is independent under our standards, the following minimum criteria for the di-\nrector are required:\n\n1) No fees received from the company (committee, consulting or board) are more than 20% in relation to their annual income;\n2) No previous employment at the company;\n3) No family relationships with the company\u2019s executives or directors;\n\n4) No transactions between the director, the director's employer or the director's immediate family member's current employer and the\ncompany in the last fiscal year.\n\nIf more than 50% of the board members are considered independent, the stock is scored one point.\n\nnote: Typically, listing standards state that for a director to be independent no or only a minor share of ownership is allowed, nor should\nthe director have any relationship to a significant shareholder. Warren Buffett mentioned that Jesus understood this calibration of inde-\npendence far more than most institutions. Matthew 6:21 observes: \u201cFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\u201d We stick to\nBuffett\u2019s biblical standard when it comes to independence and ownership. We believe that a meaningful level of share ownership is a good\nsign, but not necessary for independence.\n\nSimilarly, the least independent directors tend to be those who receive an important fraction of their annual income from fees they receive\nfor board service (and who also hope as well to be recommended for election to other boards and thereby to boost their income further).\nYet these are the very board members most often classed as \u2018independent\u2019. While pay should be sufficient to attract high-calibre individu-\nals, directors with disproportionately high fees are deemed not independent by our standards.\n\nAnother issue with listing standards is long-tenured directors. When a company limits a competent director's term, it limits his or her\nopportunity to learn and acquire relevant expertise to contribute to more than just governing. Directors need to provide long-term strate-\ngic guidance to management, by coaching and nurturing talent. The prospect of investing a huge amount of time to learn the business and\nwin management's trust and respect is daunting. For most directors this is a long journey, and it would be unwise to kick them out after\nthey\u2019ve served for several years. After all, companies don\u2019t fire high-performance employees on their tenth anniversary.\n\nMoreover, if the board is composed of members with prestige, political figures, close friends, consultants, or lawyers, this may indicate\nthat the CEO is bringing in people loyal to him or her and is not running the business with shareholders\u2019 interests in mind.

A terrible manager is a lot easier to confront or remove than a mediocre manager.\n\nAkey problem in all governance structures is that evaluation of CEOs is never conducted in regular meetings in the absence of that chief\nexecutive. Holding regular meetings without the CEO to review his or her performance can produce marked improvements in corporate\ngovernance. If there are concerns, the board should try to help develop the CEO unless it becomes objectively clear that he or she cannot do\nthe job and must be replaced.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nContact the chairman of the board or the remuneration committee and ask if they hold regular annual meetings without the CEO (and\ndirectors who are members of management) to review his or her performance. Try to verify this by checking up meeting attendance at the\nremuneration committee in the annual report.\n\n\u2018Ask the CEO how confident an investor should be that the board is suitably independent to monitor his or her performance and what\nperformance standards he or she is being measured on.

Is the size of the board reasonable?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nBoard size is an important factor in board performance because the effectiveness of each director is strongly influenced by the number of\nother directors with whom each director must interact. Boards must be small enough to promote timely discussion and efficient decision-\nmaking, but also large enough to gain sufficient input and encourage debate. A board that is too small or too large tends to be easy for man-\nagement to control.\n\nA director on a board with too many members will find it very difficult to participate in the full board's leadership process and outcomes,\nwhich includes intense listening, thought-provoking questioning, and insightful comments and perspectives. Also, larger boards typically\nlead to less candid discussion of managerial performance and to greater control by the CEO.\n\nA director on a board with too few members will experience isolation, limited input, interaction with a narrow field of vision, and pressure\nto reduce his or her independence.

They typically exhibit\nstrong business acumen and are most likely professional high-performers themselves.\n\nBusiness-savvy directors often improve company performance by acting as respected mentors for the management team. They help\nwhere they can and when they can\u2019t they make introductions to the right resources.\n\nAnother important aspect of a board is shareholder-orientation. Directors will be most inclined to look out for shareholders\u2019 interests\nwhen they are shareholders themselves - the higher the stake, the more passionate the stewardship.

Warren\nBuffett has often noted the advantage that companies gain from this kind of director. To determine whether each board member is a good\nfit according to these standards, you should review all directors\u2019 professional background and speak with them in person if possible.\n\nWhether a board director is considered business-savvy or not depends on whether they have a very successful capital allocation and/or\noperational track record. The former includes deep experience of the capital markets and fund raising, but primarily involves a great track\nrecord of long-term investing. The latter means that they have helped (as a director, manager or major shareholder) build or maintain a\nsuccessful business over an extended period while providing superior returns to owners. The key here is that the director understands\nwhat constitutes a high-quality business - this is an absolute necessity.\n\nNot only must board members be business savvy, but they must also be shareholder-oriented. It is desirable that they hold sizeable personal\nstakes in companies they serve, above and beyond board compensation, so that they truly walk in the owners\u2019 shoes.

Are a major portion of existing or potential revenues recurring?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nAhigh degree of recurring revenues increases the stability of a business and the predictability of its cash flows. Businesses with multiple\nsources of recurring revenue almost always have big premiums to their valuation multiples because of their predictability.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nFind out if the majority of the company\u2019s existing or potential revenues are predictable and recurring. Look for business models that sup-\nport long-term, annuity-like, revenue streams with the following characteristics:\n\n1. repeatable offering based on long-term contracted revenues like subscription, training, maintenance, leasing, or license fees;\n2. repeat use of the product based on short repurchase cycles like aftermarket sales (disposables, for example) or products bought\nout of habit.\n\nThe first characteristic means the customer is renting the product, not owning it. The second means that the product is consumed daily or\nweekly by customers and will need to be purchased again quickly, no matter how the economy is doing.\n\nNonetheless, not all recurring revenues are equal. The biggest potential issue is if the customer is being charged based on usage or trans-\nactions, which could deviate significantly. It\u2019s very important to understand the quality and volatility of the \u2018recurring\u2019 revenue and the\ndifference between annuity income streams and lumpy revenues.\n\f"}, "000684.png": {"text": "For example, software companies can sell a one-time license that includes the first year of support.

Especially fast-growing companies rely heavily on alliances to extend their technical and operational resources.

Is the business asset-light and able to scale up without expensive reinvestment?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThis check evaluates if the company is able to finance its growth itself. More precisely, it examines whether it is asset-light as this enables\nit to expand faster, more easily and on a larger scale. Such companies can generate more cash while growing, and due to low capital invest-\nment, there is no need for borrowing, and the overall business risk is much lower. Moreover, a low asset base leads to lower volatility in\nearnings and is simpler to value, so is generally valued more highly than an asset-heavy business.\n\nIdeally a company doesn't own much of the physical assets. Instead it makes use of other companies\u2019 investments for its own benefit. It\nmay outsource some of the production and/or services, license in and out through strategic alliances, and asset-share. Usually it has devel-\noped a single product that it can sell to a lot of customers with few incremental costs.\n\nThe very best businesses often find a way to leverage someone else\u2019s capital expenditures for free (the upfront cost of connecting people\nto the web, for example). Typically, such companies leverage technology substantially to provide their business with rapid scalability, sig-\nnificant efficiencies, and great profitability.\n\nIf large capital investments are required to manufacture products or to provide services, the business is capital-intensive. It requires\nconstant funding, and a lot more to grow, which will either dilute shareholders (through additional equity raises) or use up earned cash.\nExamples of capital-intensive industries are automobile manufacturing, airlines, steel production, oil production and refining, and chem-\nicals production.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nAnasset-light business model is one that requires little capital for operations and expansion. Two common turnover ratios to use in your\nassessment of whether a business is asset-light are sales to working capital and sales to fixed assets.\n\nWorking capital turnover serves as a good measure of operating efficiency. The higher the working capital turnover, the less money a\ncompany has tied up to achieve its sales. Working capital is simply the money needed to keep \u2018oiling the wheels\u2019 of the business. If the\nworking capital turnover ratio is 5 or higher it is considered asset-light, but the best companies actually have negative working capital. It\nis common to see negative working capital in subscription-based business models where customers pay up for recurring service or access.\nBecause revenue is recognized when the service is performed, which is after the cash comes in, these businesses typically have operating\ncash flow that exceeds net profit.\n\nLikewise, turnover of fixed assets (property, plant, and equipment, or PPE) is a good proxy for a company\u2019s capital intensity. Companies\nwith low capital intensity typically have small fixed asset bases resulting in a high turnover ratio above 5, as it implies a relatively modest\nphysical asset base.\n\f"}, "000687.png": {"text": "For example, if a typical manufacturing business wants to grow it will require significant capital investments in new factories, machinery,\nand trucks.

The advantage of the organic route of growth is a consistency in the growth path, a lack of turbulence and the\nability to chart and structure the company\u2019s future activities.\n\n   \n\nAgrowth-by-acquisition strategy involves more complex accounting that can more easily conceal problems. In addition, each acqui:\ntypically ends up being bigger than the last, increasing the price and therefore the level of risk.\n\nAnother issue with acquisitions is that integrating excessive purchases can be distracting for management and disruptive to the acquirer's\ncore business as it often tends to dilute the culture. The classic example of this pitfall is Coca-Cola in the 1980s, which allocated proceeds\nfrom the core business into acquiring Columbia Studios before refocusing a few years later. However, serial acquirers are a different breed\nof companies than companies that make large \u2018transformative\u2019 deals. For more, please see check #4 in the Capital Allocation checklist.\n\nAlthough acquisitions can be entirely reasonable, the experience of most companies across the world shows that organic growth is gen-\nerally the wiser choice when it comes to building up a business. But once critical mass is achieved, a successful acquisition can help that\ncompany grow further and increase the core business's competitive advantage.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nManagers should always describe the strategy that will shape the company\u2019s future, it should be easy to find along with its key assump-\ntions on its homepage and annual reports.

Does the business have a long runway for growth?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThis check assesses whether the company has products with sufficient market potential to enable substantial increases in sales over a\ndecade at least. A company seeking a sustained period of growth needs to have plenty of room to continue reinvesting capital both organ-\nically and through acquisitions for years into the future. Developing insights about a company\u2019s growth potential is clearly critical for\npredictability.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nLook for an end-market that is primed for an indefinite period of growth ahead. Instead of focusing on next quarter or next year, the key is\nto step back and envision how big this company can be in a decade or two. What you are looking for is the certainty that the company has\nthe ability to grow consistently for many years to come, preferably decades, Often this means that the company has products that address\nlarge and growing markets, rather than shrinking ones with substantial over-capacity.\n\nThink about the runway left and total addressable market (often referred to as TAM) for a company.

Does the business operate in a highly profitable industry?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThis check measures the attractiveness of the industry in which a company operates. A large part of your potential rate of return over the\nlong-term is attributable to the industry you are invested in, as opposed to a specific company you are invested in. This criterion helps you\nto determine which companies are in the most promising industries for you as an investor.\n\nThe profitability of a business typically trends toward the mean of the industry, as it is difficult for any business to outperform the indus-\ntry for along period of time. Any business can earn above-average return for a while, but competition eventually compels most businesses\nto pass the savings along to consumers. Likewise, it takes a truly exceptional business to buck a trend of challenging conditions.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nIn order to assess whether the business operates in a highly profitable industry, check whether the industry\u2019s 10-year median ROIC is\ngreater than 15%. To refine expectations, you could dig down to more refined sub-industry groupings.\n\nIf it\u2019s easy to make money in an industry, you will find that most companies are doing well, and the best businesses are not far from the\nworst in terms of return on invested capital (ROIC). Indirectly a high ROIC for the relevant industry will also answer if the company\u2019s strat-\negy and those of its rivals are more focused on profitability than market share.\n\nHowever, be careful when buying into an industry with excess capacity since overcapacity is normally equated with negative or below\naverage ROIC. Similarly, you should be cautious if the management tend to talk about their peers in disrespectful terms. If the language\nused is dismissive or aggressive, the risk of mutually destructive behaviour increases.\n\nIf the 10-year median ROIC for the relevant industry is greater than 15%, the stock is scored one point.\n\f"}, "000695.png": {"text": "3. Does the business operate in a slow-changing market with long product cycles?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThis check indicates whether the company operates in a slow changing market, as consistent products equate to consistent profits. Some\nbusinesses have significantly longer life spans than others due to the nature of their products. Companies whose products have long prod-\nuct cycles, that last for more than a decade, don't have to continually invent new technologies and keep competing with new generations\nof products. Or more precisely, they are more adaptable because they have more time to see and react to change.\n\nMany investing mistakes arise from illusions of predictability, which are especially acute in a rapidly changing industry. A short product\ncycle means that it is much easier for a new player to come in and do better. So, sustaining market leadership in industries marked by fast-\npaced innovation is extremely challenging.\n\nCompanies that are resilient to technological innovation are becoming increasingly harder to find as technology impacts more and more\nindustries. In fast-changing markets companies must stay flexible and keep an eye on the needs of the constantly evolving markets they\noperate in, Any competitive advantage has to come from a corporate culture, the ability to constantly come up with new or improved\nproducts, rather than the products themselves. Nonetheless, at some point companies that must change constantly are destined to make\nwrong decisions and succumb.\n\n \n\nHow to assess it?\n\nIt is consistency in the product that creates consistency in the company profits. Look for opportunities where time is an ally, not an enemy.\nIf you think that the company will continue to sell the same or similar products for the next 10 years, then the business is considered as\noperating in a slow-changing market with long product cycles. Typically, you will see a gradual product improvement over time that dis-\ncourage competitors from entering.\n\nA good complementary sign is if the industry market shares have remained stable with few new players in the last five years, as market\nshare volatility is a sign of weak entry and/or scaling barriers.\n\nThink of the smartphone market. Apple never produced phones when BlackBerry was the king of the smartphone market. In 2009\nBlackberry was producing incredibly high returns on invested capital of around 40%. But just five years later Blackberry was a completely\ndifferent business with different products than it was in 2009. The bottom line is that you should avoid companies that are dependent on\nevolving technology adoption along with a hypercompetitive marketplace as obsolescence risk is high.\n\nIf you judge that the company will continue to sell the same or similar products for the next 10 years, the stock is scored one point.\n\f"}, "000696.png": {"text": "4, Does the business have limited competition?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nCompetition always exists but does not increase the value of a business.

In addition, a business with limited competition is more predictable than one that has lots of competitors.\n\nEveryone has competition, even those companies that are disrupting a market. Even so, some competition is acceptable because com-\npetitors help educate the market. Competitors\u2019 presence can also legitimise and reduce the perceived risk of a new product category and\nattract enabling services and technologies.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nTo understand the nature of the competitive landscape, check whether companies have a history of co-existing peacefully with each other,\nmaking the industry highly profitable overall as a result. This is most likely to exist if there are only a few companies that talk about each\nother in respectful terms.\n\nA great sign is if the industry is consolidated to just a handful of players of various sizes with entirely different value propositions for\n\ncustomers. As a result, all diverge away from competing on common ground.

Is the business resilient in the face of new innovations?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nBeware companies operating in areas at the leading edge of technology. When it comes to competition it is key to think not about where\nthe company is competing, but where it is going to be competing. This is particularly important in industries where the pace of technolog-\nical change is very fast, like healthcare and technology.\n\nAchange in market or industry structure is a major opportunity for innovation. Technological changes driving market alterations are\noften more serious than they initially seem. Large, dominant producers and suppliers, having been successful and unchallenged for many\nyears, tend to be arrogant and slow to respond.\n\nAt first, they dismiss the newcomer as insignificant and, indeed, amateurish. But even when the newcomer takes a larger and larger share\nof their business, they typically find it hard to mobilize themselves for counteraction. The bottom line is that companies in industries that\nhave changed rapidly survive only if they keep renewing themselves at a fast pace. They either get research priorities right or competition\nleaves them in the dust. Think Nokia versus Apple.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nAlllisted companies around the world must provide commentary about their performance and outlook on a regular basis. There you'll\nfind clues about where they see threats coming from. From there you can dig further to discover the emerging players in their market and\nhow they get a piece of the action in order to understand the threat from new innovations.\n\nIt's important to understand that very meaningful competition can come not only from similar products but also doing it an entirely\ndifferent way, or even not doing it at all. Try to escape the present and project some of the more obvious new behaviours and technologies\nfarther out into the future. New enabling technologies are often leading indicators of where the next great wave of innovation can be\ncreated, as most technological advances are widely applicable to many problems and markets.

Look for signs of new technologies that foster product improve-\nments and whether there has been a shift to horizontal markets from an industry organized vertically.\n\nDon\u2019t confuse novelty with disruptive innovation. The former is more a question of great features added in an attempt to differentiate,\nwhereas real innovation redefines the market as it changes the way the world works. Typically, it transforms complex and expensive\nproducts by deploying new technology or business model to make them easier, cheaper or more convenient. This happens in part because\nthe disruptor accepts lower margins and pursues a specific piece of the value chain that incumbents neglected. And in part because the\ninnovation does not fit into the incumbents\u2019 established way of making money, preventing them from commercialising it. Disruptive in-\nnovation simply is reinvention that is industry-altering.\n\nServices are generally less prone to disruption through obsolescence as they are typically competing on a local geographical scale, while\nproducts tend to compete on a global basis. Similarly, companies with sophisticated, or complex, products are more likely to fend off com-\npetition for a longer time, as the technical challenge of replicating products creates high barriers to entry.

Knowing who the core or target customers of the business are is key to gaining\nin-depth understanding of a business, their position and to monitor customer trends and how the business caters to them. The more fo-\ncused a customer group a company has, the better it is able to appeal to those customers and manage for their loyalty.\n\nMany times, it\u2019s just a small percentage of customers that represent a large percentage of the revenues for a business. As a result, acom-\npany\u2019s true market is typically limited to those customers for whom that purchase is a top buying priority (the ideal customer). As you go\nup in customer buying priorities, you generally go down in market size, since more people feel a problem generally than acutely.\n\nFocus taken to the extreme, can easily put a company ina situation where it\u2019s building a product for a single unique customer.

Instead, make sure that the company has a clearly defined core (target) customer segment. To identify the core customer, ask\nmanagement questions like: If you could allocate more resources to one specific group who would it be? Which customers are the most\nloyal?

Do the products solve a genuine customer need, rather than create desire?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThe best businesses are so good at solving problems for their customers that they become indispensable. Many new products serve a\nuseful purpose, but they don\u2019t change our lives or our productivity in a meaningful way. There\u2019s simply no point in making a product that\nbrings no real substantial value to customers.\n\nConsider the common everyday fidget spinner - the low-friction plastic toy that seemingly defies Newton's laws. They were wanted badly\nby many, yet weren\u2019t great investments for their manufacturers in the long run. The distinction is that a valuable company provides a\nproduct that is useful and will remain valued by its customers.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nYou have to get into the mindset of a future buyer to understand how useful this new product will be or how well the product is plugged\ninto the customer's value chain. The key is to assess whether or not there is long-term demand for the company\u2019s product. Products hold\ntheir primacy just so long as their quality remains high.\n\nLook for products that improve health, enrich emotional life, fulfill basic needs or is perceived as necessary, but where customers can't\nor won't switch. If the product is a default choice for most customers, it's probably a need-to-have item. The holy grail is a product that is\nlifestyle-changing as it can achieve \u2018hockey-stick\u2019 earnings trajectory for at least a few years. Also, when a product gives the consumer a\ncompetitive advantage, it will usually see very rapid uptake as it becomes established as a new industry standard.\n\nA great product/market fit strongly tends to generate strong word of mouth. If you are solving a real need in someone's life, it\u2019s only\nnatural that they will talk to other people about it. However, be cautious if the company\u2019s products are trend-sensitive or taste-dependent\n(fashion, flavours and fragrances, for example) as these are susceptible to shifting consumer preferences.\n\nCustomer loyalty is best understood by customer feedback, not by extrapolating past numbers. This makes it harder to estimate revenues\nusing only historical numbers. Ask what customers would do without the company's products. If it was taken from them, would that be a\nproblem? Would their life be worse?\n\nLikewise, it is easy to be misled by good acquisition numbers when it comes to digital products. If the product has real value for customers,\nyou should see good engagement numbers and even better retention metrics. Top-of-funnel growth means nothing if the users churn.\nMerely selling a product doesn\u2019t automatically translate into customer success - customer retention is a better indicator of future growth.\n\nProvided there is a consistent flow of new customers at an acceptable acquisition cost, low churn will allow recurring revenues to grow\u2014\nimproving the growth rate and reducing the risk of value loss over the long term.

As a rule of thumb, smaller customers tend to have higher churn\nrates.\n\nAlso, it's important to determine whether it's a technology which is not yet a product, or a product feature (or component supplier) which\n\nmay never become more than an add-on for someone else\u2019s product, or if it's providing a complete solution or product concept that a sub-\nstantial company can be built around.\n\nIf the company\u2019s product is likely to be in high deman\u00e9 far into the future, the stock is scored one point.\n\f"}, "000705.png": {"text": "3. Are the products only modestly vulnerable to substitutes?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nCustomer perception is critical. With effective differentiation, a company minimizes the perception among consumers that its product\nhas many close substitutes. Making products that offer proprietary content, have patented or unmatched features or acquiring and adding\nvalue to such products is a starting point for differentiation. In addition, a perceived lack of substitutes raises switching costs. That said,\nthe most devastating substitutes cost less and have at least one feature that is superior.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nTry to assess whether the company\u2019s products are thought by its core customers to have no close substitutes. The key to answering this\nquestion is to understand why customers buy the company\u2019s product and why they might stop buying it or switch to a competitor's\nproduct.\n\nAgreat way to learn interesting things about a company\u2019s product is to talk to the company\u2019s customers. Find out whether they are finding\ncheaper or simpler products that are \u2018good enough\u2019? Can a customer perform similar functions with a different or more integrated product\nthat appeals to potential customers who do not want multiple devices? Or would they have to own multiple devices or platforms to per-\nform all of the necessary functions or have a similar experience?\n\nAgood complementary question is whether existing customers will stay even if a competitor lowers its price? Remember, the larger a\ncorporate customer is, the more objective its purchasing decisions. Larger companies typically focus more on direct cost savings and are\nless willing to pay for intangible or convenience benefits. They typically use procurement departments that enhance rational behaviour in\ncorporate buying.\n\nIf the company\u2019s products are thought by its customers to have no close substitute, the stock is scored one point.\n\f"}, "000706.png": {"text": "4, Does the company offer good value to its customers?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nQuality in a product is not what the supplier puts in - it\u2019s what the customer gets out and is willing to pay for. A business that wants to cre-\nate value needs a unique and persuasive reason for its customers to buy. Often a marginal improvement on a marginal cost is not enough\nto drive buying behaviour in all but a tiny minority of power-users. Likewise, engineering doesn\u2019t always have the right answer because of\nthe customer's subjective perception - especially for mission-critical products that are built on trust and reliability.\n\nAt the end of the day, customers are the stakeholders who determine the fate of a business. Sometimes they are unwilling to pay a pre-\nmium price for a product, even if the less expensive alternative needs to be replaced or repaired frequently. Equally, if customers are not\nsatisfied with a product they will eventually find alternatives, or another company will eventually create an alternative if one does not\nexist already.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nTo convince customers to buy, new products usually need to be several orders of magnitude better than the current state of the art. There\nis alot of inertia in the \u2018good enough\u2019 syndrome where people prefer the safe and familiar status quo. Moreover, the best product isn\u2019t\nalways competitive on price as customers buy for other reasons as well, like cost and convenience or environmental concerns. Yet, it must\nbe affordable for broad market adoption. That\u2019s why you should wait for a proof of customers' willingness to pay up for a product, which\nshows if it really offers them value. At earlier stages, accumulating a set of users who really loves it would be a great sign.\n\nYou should be highly concerned if a company seeks to extract as much value as possible from their customers in the attempt to maximize\nshareholder value. In these situations, customers will feel that they aren't getting good value. Sometimes they continue to pay because\nof limited competition, or the company having some form of competitive advantage. In that case the business is extracting value from,\nrather than adding value to, its customers. This parasitic relationship could lead to customers feeling exploited. If a competitor were to\ncome up with a better alternative, they would probably jump ship.\n\nSimilarly, some companies create complexity for their customers because it makes things easier for themselves. Complexity comes in\nmany forms: requiring customers to invest a lot of time learning how to use the product is one example. Other examples include requiring\nsignificant changes in their behaviour or, making it difficult for them to switch to another provider or, not being compatible with any\nproducts outside the selling company\u2019s own ecosystem. The last of these means the less optionality a business provides its customers, the\nless value the product will have for them. In all cases you should be very cautious if the company\u2019s product makes life harder for many cus-\ntomers, as creating a sales success is likely to be difficult.\n\f"}, "000707.png": {"text": "Finally, beware your own blind spots when you don\u2019t match the user archetype that the company\u2019s product is built for.

When it comes to building products, success requires intense\ndedication to help client companies achieve their goals and solve their needs. An average company does not develop a deep enough un-\nderstanding of customers\u2019 present and future needs and wants. Companies like this are at risk of being blindsided by shifting customer\ndemands.\n\nA business with a strong value proposition ultimately manages to ask its customers what they feel about the product, what they want to\nachieve and how they measure success and failure. Feelings and hidden motivations largely drive what we do, but they don\u2019t come with\nexplanations attached, Still, most companies just ask customers what they want. The bottom line is that competitiveness is far more\nabout doing what customers value than doing what the company thinks it\u2019s good at.\n\nThe best companies generally find ways to consistently engage the consumer and incorporate them into their innovation and planning\ninitiatives \u2014 namely to spark ideas for improved or new products.

Does the company possess the ability to raise prices without losing customers?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThe existence of a sustainable competitive advantage, or moat, will typically be demonstrated by a company\u2019s pricing power, or consumer\nwillingness to pay. This is the company\u2019s ability to set its own prices, rather than have the market dictate the prices. The latter means that\nthe price for the product is negotiated and the company must lower the price to keep the customer.\n\nThe legendary Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen once said, \u201cRaising prices is a great way to flesh out whether you actually have a\nmoat. If you do have a moat, the customers will still buy... The definition of a moat is the ability to charge more.\u201d\n\nPricing power is the opportunity to raise prices in excess of inflation without fear of losing customers or being undercut by competitors.\nThis means that a business can raise prices in real terms without affecting unit volume, to generate superior returns on capital. Nonethe-\nless, it is not an unlimited or unchecked ability to raise prices at any rate the business desires.\n\nStrong brands are a well-known source of pricing power. Pharmaceuticals are another notable example of pricing power, at least until\npatents expire.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nWhen assessing pricing power, gross profit margin growth and consistently high gross profit margins relative to industry peers tend to\nindicate pricing power, while volatility in these metrics suggests otherwise. However, don\u2019t rely too much on gross profits alone when\ncomparing peers, as different companies account for expenses differently.\n\nMichael Shearn, who is the author of The Investment Checklist, highlights several key characteristics in pricing power:\n\n1. Companies that have high customer retention rates;\n2. Customers who have low price sensitivity or only spend a small percentage of their budget on the business's product;\n\n3. Customers that have plenty of cash or highly profitable business models;\n\n4. Customers where the quality of the product is more important than the price and a higher price is signalling higher quality.\n\nAlso, pay close attention when you see competitive industries undergoing rationalisations. As soon as they are consolidated down to three\nplayers (creating an oligopoly), the pain may already be gone and rational pricing will typically follow. Consolidated industries generally\ncreate a sort of pent-up pricing power that can be released in the form of real price increases. The message here is that you may find real\npricing power in businesses that for some reason have not raised prices for a long period of time.\n\f"}, "000717.png": {"text": "Finally, to sustain pricing power, the company needs to constantly improve the value it offers to the customer.

When revenues drop and the cost of making the goods stays the same, the gross margin will decline.\n\nConversely, gross margin growth over time is a good indicator of a company\u2019s ability to reduce costs or maintain price increases without\nlosing customers, i.e. achieving cost efficiency and/or pricing power.\n\nHow to assess it?\nIf the gross profit margin is lower than three years ago, this check is flagged.\n\nThis factor has a zero-weight impact on the scoring model for Business and is included as additional information to assist with invest-\nment decision-making.\n\f"}, "000719.png": {"text": "PROXY GUIDE: COMPETITIVE MOATS\n\nompetitive moats are a business\u2019 capacity to maintain competitive advantages that preserve its long-term profitability and mar-\n\nket share in the face of competition. Companies with competitive moats typically survive financially even if management talent\n\ndoes not deliver as expected or if they leave the business. Finding companies with genuine moats is not easy. It takes time and re-\nsearch. However, an extensive literature has emerged since Warren Buffett first introduced the concept.\n\nWe divide all moats on the basis of price or cost advantages - the two main factors that define a company\u2019s profitability. Below six common\ncompetitive moats are described briefly:\n\nCost Advantages\n\nCompanies that enjoy cost structure advantages produce better quality at a lower price than the competition or just apply price pressure to\nknock them out. This involves creating a product much cheaper, both to make and supply.\n\nSCALE EcoNomiEs: Generate economies of scale in production (buying power) and large distribution networks, as per-unit costs fall with\nincreasing output, creating a \u2018flywheel that accelerates as the business grows. For example, building software costs the same regardless\nof the number of people buying it. Relative size matters more than absolute size as it makes the cost of gaining share prohibitive. Even so,\neconomies of scale tend to dissipate when the market gets large enough.\n\nsPEciaL assets: Benefit from privileged access at attractive terms to certain assets or resources that can independently enhance value like\npatents, ownership, licenses, government approvals, proprietary technology, superior business model, strong distribution network, or\nlocation/geographical proximity, as in cases like airports and mines. These are all elements that competitors cannot access or match with-\nout suffering a net economic loss.\n\nFor example, if a company has a strong distribution network that reaches its customers effectively and efficiently, it has a huge advantage\nover other competitors that lack such distribution. Also, a company with a strong distribution moat will also be able to enter new areas\nto expand its total addressable market (TAM) as its competitive advantage does not depend on a specific product, but rather its ability to\n\f"}, "000720.png": {"text": "distribute any relevant product. Such companies typically leverage their strong distribution moats by distributing acquired products toa\nwider audience than what the originator companies could access themselves.\n\nPeter Thiel, puts this point well in his great book Zero to One: \u201cSuperior sales and distribution by itself can create a monopoly, even with no\nproduct differentiation. The converse is not true.\u201d\n\nprocess rower: Depend on a series of chain-linked core activities to provide a whole product, which rivals cannot readily replicate or do by\nhiring away the people. To gain success with process power each core activity must be performed well, as they reinforce each other. Still, it\ntakes significant trial and error to get the needed reinforcing actions in place - to make them deeply embedded inside the organisation.\n\nPrice Advantages\n\nCompanies that enjoy price advantages lock out competitors through high entry and scalability barriers to sustainably earn high profit\nmargins. This involves creating a product that is convenient, emotionally appealing, and very easy to use \u2014 or simply high quality.\n\nswircHinc costs: Make it cost more for customers to switch to an alternative supplier than to remain. This means that first-mover compa-\nnies have the potential to enjoy high switching costs if they scale fast. Still, this value can only be captured if a buyer purchases repeatedly\nor buys add-on products. Note that switching costs come in many forms- money, time, risk and inconvenience (breaking good business re-\nlationships, for example).\n\nSometimes, the competitive advantage of a business is a result of very long product lifecycles associated with inability to exit from the\ninitial investment leading to relatively insurmountable switching costs. Typically, this happens when a business can embed itself in the\ncustomer's business processes in a way that it becomes prohibitive for the customer to switch. In such cases, if the supplier can generate\nsubstantial aftermarket revenues, it will have endowed itself with a substantial competitive advantage.\n\nnetwork eFFects: Provide a product where every new user makes the product more valuable to all other users. This is like scale economies,\nbut instead of reducing the producer's cost it increases the buyer's willingness to pay. To be able to scale fast it's critical to get the product\nright early on, as networks win only at scale and have a \u2018winner takes it all\u2019 boundedness.\n\nFor example, in a two-sided network like an auction or a marketplace business, more buyers showing up will attract more sellers, and that\nin turn will attract more buyers. Once this positive cycle is in place, it becomes nearly impossible to convince either buyer or seller to leave\nand join a new platform. Businesses such as eBay and Airbnb have built up strong two-sided networks over time.\n\nDifferent types of network effects are stronger or weaker than others, and they each work differently-learn more about them at\nwww.nfx.com.\n\f"}, "000721.png": {"text": "BRAND LovaLty: Create a strong brand that will earn superior returns to those with no branding. A strong brand means consistency and a\npromise to consumers, who will prefer it over any other, almost regardless of price or convenience and sometimes even if the product is\nsubstandard. Loyal customers are simply less tempted by other offers and incentives since it is the label, not the product, that bestows\n\nbrand loyalty.\n\nBrands can create customer loyalty through one or both of these two routes:\n\n+ Reducing uncertainty as the customer attains \u2018peace of mind\u2019, knowing that the product will be as just as expected. This\nhappens through (a) lower search costs as an informational advantage of being well-known and/or (b) good reputation to confer\n\nlegitimacy.\n\n+ Eliciting good feelings about the product, distinct from the objective value. This happens when it signals status to express\n\nindividuality.\n\nHowever, creating a strong brand typically takes a long investment runway with no assurance of success. Also, counterfeiters with incon-\nsistent offerings may undermine it. Efforts to copy another brand run the risk of trademark infringement actions with their related costs\nand uncertain outcomes. Finally, branding is a non-exclusive advantage, which means that a competitor can target the same customers\nwith an equally impactful brand (Prada, Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e9s, for example).\n\f"}, "000722.png": {"text": "OPERATIONAL RISK ANALYSIS\n\nDOES THE BUSINESS HAVE LIMITED EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL RISKS?\n\ninvestment evaluations should start by measuring risk. Negative events, speed bumps, and glancing blows will occur even\nduring the maturation of great companies. It\u2019s your job to know the difference between a glancing blow and a knockout punch\nthat could sink the business.\n\nAt the extreme are those businesses whose revenues depend on binary outcomes where either the company achieves major success or\nperishes completely (biotech and e-commerce companies are examples). This is typically the case for companies where revenues come\nfroma single product or title as these are typically one-time in nature.\n\nLikewise, the risk is high when revenues are tied to commodity prices (such as oil and gas companies) or when the businesses rely ona\nsmall number of large one-off contracts. The latter means the businesses could see earnings take a sharp downward tum if one contract is\ncancelled or, even worse, if future contracts become scarce.\n\nIn such businesses you're basically always operating in the dark and are restricted in making realistic forecasts. Understanding such risks\nare very important since growth and profitability could be highly unstable.

Is the business relatively immune to regulatory risk?\nWhy does it matter?\n\nUnexpected regulatory changes can send shockwaves around the markets and destroy companies. Accordingly, it's a good idea to spend\nsome time thinking about the regulatory risks that a company is exposed to. Given the arbitrary nature of many political decisions, even\nthe most expert analysts struggle to predict how a government's actions might impact a particular stock.\n\nSome companies receive their revenue from government sources, either directly or indirectly. But if the government is able to change\nthe amount of revenue received due to budget changes, for example, the earnings of these companies whose products are subsidised by\nthe government will always be at risk. A reduction in this subsidy would increase the cost for consumers and subsequently reduce the\ndemand.\n\nLikewise, businesses regulated by the government are at risk of a change in laws and regulations, as these can have a deep impact on\npricing and operating costs or change the competitive landscape. That's usually the case for pharma companies, for example, given the im-\nportance of regulatory agencies in approving and reimbursing new drugs.\n\nAlways factor in a high likelihood of negative aggressive regulation of business models that the government doesn\u2019t approve of, like\ngambling or consumer loans.

Is the business defensive and independent of market conditions?\nWhy does it matter?\n\n\u2018An industry may be in a strong growth period and look very attractive, but it may also be at the peak of a cycle that is possibly about to\nturn substantially negative. A cyclical business will report the highest earnings at the top of a cycle, right before income is about to de-\ncline. Investors often fall for cyclical stocks exactly when their valuations start to imply strong growth far into the future.\n\nPeople love extrapolation and forget that cycles exist. Yet, many companies follow the cycle of the economy, meaning that their perfor-\nmance will be cyclical and relatively unpredictable. When expansionary periods are sustained for surprisingly long time, people begin to\nbelieve that cyclicality has been conquered, and growth starts to look sustainable when it is not.\n\nThe best companies are those that do well when the economy is doing well and don't miss a beat when the economy falls into recession.\nDemand for their products is stable rather than cyclical, which contributes to steady top-line growth. As a result, companies that sell ne-\ncessities, rather than products that are merely desired, are likely to do better in a recession. In other words, defensive stocks hold up much\nbetter than cyclical ones in market crises and recessions ~ or at least rebound faster.\n\nHow to assess it?\n\nIf the business isn\u2019t cyclically fragile and can grow despite the overall economy, the company\u2019s revenues are considered recession-proof\ntoa high degree. Such companies typically sell products that are necessities that address a very basic need for their customers. Instead,\ncyclical stocks are those that correlate with the overall economy, including luxury items and other discretionary spending. Try to under-\nstand how the last recession hit the company. Also consider the extent to which its products are exposed to the cyclicality of its customers\u2019\nmarkets.\n\nLikewise, companies that depend on access to capital markets to raise cash are indirectly dependent on the overall economy to grow their\nbusiness. Accordingly, companies that are highly dependent on market conditions should be considered cyclical.\n\nIf the business is neither in a market with cyclical demand nor is dependent on the capital markets, the stock is scored one point.\n\nnore: Companies that operate in defensive markets are not necessarily better investments than companies that operate in cyclical markets,\nbut at least management doesn't have to deal with the business cycle on top of everything else.\n\nThe key to successful investing in cyclical companies is to look for companies that are able to operate at low prices and with little debt.

Business unit managers are typically given much control over their activ-\nities, while pay is based on merit and performance.

Identifying companies able to shrug off short-termism and gravity\nof financial theory means investing in quality stocks which are more likely to stand the test of time over the long term.\n\nQuality stocks tend to offer fewer negative surprises and, as a result, experience smaller falls than the overall market. Accordingly, invest-\ning in quality companies helps avoid the unnecessary frustrations associated with recovering from steep losses. But the real potential\nreward for investing in them is that high-quality companies continue growing over time by consistently reinvesting a large part of their\nearnings at high rates of return. This compounds the value of your stake in the business over many years, achieving exponential growth.\nThat's why great businesses are often referred to as compounders.\n\nA business\u2019 compounding power can be analysed across three key dimensions:\n\n- The percentage of earnings that can be reinvested back into the business\n+ The return on reinvested capital that the business can achieve\n+ How excess cash flow not reinvested in the business is used\n\nFor example, if a business can achieve 20% incremental returns on capital and reinvest 50% of its earnings each year, its intrinsic value\nwill compound by 10% annually (20% x 50%). If it can buy back its shares at cheap levels or make value-accretive acquisitions with the\nother 50%, the compounding will be even stronger.\n\nThe bottom line is that with time on your side you don't have to go for home runs to invest successfully. You will do better paying fair\nvalue for a high-quality company and sticking with it. Timing is far less important. The \u2018rolling snowball\u2019 effect of compounding explains\nwhy the risks of permanently losing capital are low even if, in hindsight, you end up overpaying for great businesses. For a deeper explana-\n\ntion see \u2018Bringing Valuation into the Equation\u2019.\n\f"}, "000804.png": {"text": "Another great and more obvious advantage in buying high-quality stocks is low portfolio turnover. You allow the money you would have\nhad to pay in capital gains taxes to continue compounding on your behalf. You also reduce transaction costs such as trading commission\nand slippage, while accruing dividends that you might otherwise miss by moving in and out of the market too quickly.\n\nOnly buying stocks for less than they are worth means that you are just speculating on an increase in its stock price, which have little to\ndo with the underlying fundamentals. Stocks owned primarily because of price tend to be investments in poor quality companies. These\nrequires constant focus on timing as they have to be sold fairly quickly. This is because any gap between price and value when you bought\nthe stock slowly erodes over time as fair value declines due to the poor quality of the business.\n\nThis leads to a second problem with making investments primarily on the basis that the stock is cheap. Once it is fairly priced and sold you\nneed to find a new opportunity, including doing all the necessary due diligence.\n\nAsa result, you can't keep using all of your previous research on an investment, even though the most valuable information usually has a\nlong timeframe for which it is relevant (quality of the business model, potential growth opportunities, industry structure, management\nteam track record etc.). Having to constantly generate new ideas by finding and analysing a lot of new information each time is a signifi-\ncant downside. On top of that, an investment approach that requires a lot of decision-making is more error-prone.\n\nBRINGING VALUATION INTO THE EQUATION\n\nHaving confidence in the long-term earnings trajectory of a business is one of the strongest edges you can have as an investor. If you are\nright about the sustainability of a high-quality company\u2019s growth and profitability, you are probably buying the business at a very low\nmultiple of future earnings. This because you get both compounding from earnings growth and the reward of multiple expansion that\ntypically follows a history of consistent earnings growth.\n\nEarnings expectations for a business don't tend to vary significantly one year out, but opinions about the multiple that it deserves do.\nThese are often focused on a belief that reversion to the mean is imminent without considering the business and company differences. It\nfollows that forecasting current year earnings is key for investors with a short-term focus.\n\nHowever, when looking further out, a company\u2019s valuation multiple is increasingly dependent on its longer-term earnings power and\npredictability. As a result, differences in earnings expectations and valuation multiples become more pronounced as market participants\u2019\nvarying assumptions compound over the long term.\n\nBecause of this, current valuation multiples should not be a major concern, if deep fundamental research supports sustainability of\ngrowth. If you are a long-term investor, your margin of safety has more to do with your confidence that a company\u2019s competitive advan-\n\f"}, "000805.png": {"text": "tages will stay strong or get stronger, rather than some estimate of a discount to its fair value.

All too often impatience costs\n\ninvestors dearly because they can't fight their emotions. Many end up buying at the tail end of a market rally or selling ina panic at\n\na loss. However, you must have patience to ride through the inevitable downswings, to wait for great investments to play out and\nlet the power of compounding do its work.\n\n \n\nLikewise, you have to have patience to wait for the right opportunity to buy at a price well below its fair value estimate. Great companies\nare rarely available at cheap valuations. But once in a while you will be able to buy them at reasonable prices - especially during an eco-\nnomic downturn or a temporary setback.\n\nIn 1973 Warren Buffet invested more than US$10 million in The Washington Post Company. By the end of 1974 the share price had\ndropped nearly 25% and it took three years to recover fully. Instead of selling his stake while the price was falling, Buffet went against the\nherd and continued buying. He knew that the fundamentals of the business were strong and that the stock was cheap. Over time the share\nprice bounced back and the business grew \u2014 and so did the underlying business value. Because of stock repurchases per-share business\nvalue increased considerably faster. Today Buffett regards his investment in the Washington Post as one of his best and most profitable\never.\n\nMaintaining a multi-year view by focusing your thoughts on the long-term fundamentals and not expecting instant returns is probably\nthe most important aspect of avoiding short-term noise. If Buffett had sold his Washington Post shares when the price fell, he would have\nlost money and missed out on the potential for future returns. That\u2019s why he is fond of saying that the stock market is a device for trans-\nferring money from the impatient to the patient. The important lesson is that if you have done your homework well in investing in a high-\nquality business, \u2018be patient and wait\u2019 remains the best stance in your pursuit of wealth creation from stocks.\n\nThe bottom line is that patience is the most essential investor quality, but also one of the hardest things to learn. As the legendary trader\nJesse Livermore once said, \u201cThat is why so many men in Wall Street who are not at all in the \u2018sucker\u2019 class, not even in the third grade, nev-\nertheless lose money.

Likewise, in a bull market, we all hate the feeling of missing out on the party and avoid cash in favour of stocks. But then, as Charlie\nMunger says, \u201cIt takes character to sit there with all that cash and do nothing. I didn\u2019t get to where I am by going after mediocre opportuni-\nties.\u201d\n\nMunger would go years building up huge cash reserves until he felt he had found something low-risk and highly intelligent. The bottom\nline is that keeping cash on hand facilitates an investor's success, even if it feels wrong to be sitting on it and earning nothing for long\nperiods.\n\nHolding cash is a cheap hedge as its value rise as the market plunges. And in addition to downside protection, cash also provides \u2018peace of\nmind\u2019 over large, unexpected costs or redemption requests by fund investors. It will certainly reduce the risk of panic-driven selling when\nmarkets get volatile. But most importantly, always having cash available to invest enables you to take advantage of opportunities that ma\npresent themselves in the future without first needing to sell other stocks - which would have likely become cheap themselves in a sell-\noff. The downside, of course, is losing purchasing power over time due to inflation and the risk of being underinvested in a rapidly rising\nmarket.\n\n \n\nAcommon-sense strategy may be to allocate at least 5% of your portfolio to cash in a prevailing bull market, though many prudent money\nmanagers may prefer to keep between 10% and 20% in cash on average. It\u2019s all about how much volatility you can stomach.

As rewards\nand penalties for compounding are asymmetrical, what you should be aiming to accomplish is avoiding big mistakes.\n\n \n\nWinning big in the stock market is all about losing the least amount possible when you're wrong, not being right all the time. Remember, a\nseasoned investor who earns 20% for two consecutive years comes out ahead of a newbie investor who earns 100% in a bull year and loses\n30% or more in the following year.\n\nThere is an old saying; \u201cThere are old pilots and there are bold pilots, but there aren\u2019t many old, bold pilots.\u201d The point is that you should\nalways try to put yourself in a position where the likelihood of a big drop is extremely limited.

That\u2019s why you should avoid leverage\n(borrowed money) by using a cash-only account at your brokerage firm. Leverage just magnifies outcomes, not adding value.

One of the most powerful concepts in portfolio\nmanagement is to let your winners run. Being a long-term investor can be relatively easy during a bull market. However, when the stock\nmarket gets extremely volatile, your resilience will be tested. After all, investing is an existential act. You are what you do, not what you\nthink.\n\nThe bottom line is that you can borrow ideas, but you can\u2019t borrow confidence or conviction. You will never hold the compounders long\nenough to achieve stellar returns if you don\u2019t understand what you own, why you own it, and its value. You need deep industry expertise\n(past work) or recent analysis (current work) and the correct mindset to withstand the pain of extreme paper losses. Crisis conditions and\nheadlines in the financial press often erode investors\u2019 patience, leading them to sell out of fear and lack of knowledge. Keep in mind that\nthis is the key reason for doing deep fundamental research, to forge the courage to hold on to or buy into stocks after they have detached\nfrom reality on the downside.\n\nBuilding real depth of knowledge about the company behind the stock is what makes part-time investing so difficult and why most retail\ninvestors struggle with stock selection. However, this is also the case for many professional money managers who have too many stocks in\ntheir portfolios.

Keep in mind the quote from the oil baron Paul Getty, \u201cTo succeed in business,\nto reach the top, an individual must know all it is possible to know about that business.\u201d\n\nSelling compounders prematurely can be a life-altering mistake. Typically, a few top-performing investments will contribute the vast\nmajority of your returns. In fact, it\u2019s a common theme among the world\u2019s greatest investors that a few winners have carried their entire\nportfolio. For example, Charlie Munger acknowledges having made almost all his money from a few big winners. The same is true for Ben-\njamin Graham, Peter Lynch, Philip Fisher, Warren Buffett and many other great investors. Typically, they have held these winners for more\nthan a decade, often 20 years or more.\n\n \n\nThe only time you should consider selling a compounder is when it stops being a great business, the position becomes too large in your\nportfolio, if the company becomes wildly overpriced or cash is needed to take advantage of a superior opportunity. Otherwise there is no\nneed to reap the gains in compounders as these are companies that increase steadily in value - stocks to \u2018buy low and let grow\u2019.\n\nFinally, only a handful of your positions need to be winners if you own enough compounders. It is easy to forget, but this is an asymmetric\ngame: you can only lose 1x your investment, but some picks can return 10x or even 100x if you have the confidence and conviction to hold\nlong enough. Although these numbers may seem unfeasible, they are achievable. As Thomas Phelps writes in 100 to 1 in the Stock Market:\n\u201cA great many people, I am sure, have never set out to increase their capital one hundredfold because they had no idea that it could be\ndone.\u201d\n\nIam sure this is still true today as it was back in 1972, when the book was first published. Moreover, finding one of these 100-baggers\nmight save your whole investment career.\n\f"}, "000818.png": {"text": "THE REDEYE TOP PICKS PORTFOLIO\n\nop Picks is a \u2018paper trading portfolio\u2019 (long only, unhedged) that Redeye offers to private investors who want to learn about invest-\ning. The portfolio is based on Redeye\u2019s coverage universe of listed Nordic stocks and leverages Redeye\u2019s core skills of fundamental\nresearch and analysis. Accordingly, we only invest in companies and industries that we already know and understand deeply.\n\nAfter all, true investment risk lies in not knowing what you are doing.\n\nThe portfolio\u2019s investment approach is highly opportunistic and focused on smaller, less followed growth stocks in the quest for tomor-\nrow\u2019s multibaggers \u2014 stocks that have prospects for gains of up to 2X and more. This is partly because the small cap space is where an\ninformation edge is more likely to be obtained. But the primary advantage of investing in small-cap stocks is that size is the first and fore-\nmost differentiator of a multibagger investing approach. It is best summarised by Christopher Mayer in his book 100 Baggers: \u201cStart with\nacorns, wind up with oak trees. Start with oak trees, and you won't have quite the same dramatic growth.\u201d\n\nWe try to identify companies supported by thematic long-term trends ~ particularly niche market leaders with proven management anda\ncompounding growth outlook. But although we prefer to take a long-term view, we are always ready to act opportunistically if we believe\nthe odds are stacked heavily in our favour. We will come back to this in \u2018Stocks Fall into Three Buckets\u2019.\n\nThe goal of the disciplined, repeatable investment process is to construct a portfolio of companies with immediate growth potential and\nthe strong likelihood of long-term profitability by the following characteristics: 1) high-quality business; 2) sufficiently undervalued; and\n3) the market is about to recognize the full potential of the business. These elements are all different ways to reduce the risk in the stocks\nwe invest in, to provide room for bad luck and mistakes. Below they are described in more detail.\n\n1. Quality: Our quality scorecard for companies swings the investment decisions. A company with overall top-level scores\nof 5 in each category (People, Business, Financials) is typically capable of withstanding the tests of time and adversity. These\ncompanies have the potential to improve with time and may be able to generate significant compounding wealth for the\nlong-term owner.\n\f"}, "000819.png": {"text": "Conversely, no matter the numbers, we refuse to invest in any company that has a People score below 4, as we believe the peo-\nple behind the company to be the most important thing.\n\n2, Valuation: We believe well bought is half sold, which is why we look for businesses that are sufficiently undervalued to\nwarrant an investment. Warren Buffett summarised the point best: \u201cNever count on making a good sale. Have the purchase\nprice be so attractive that even a mediocre sale gives good results.\u201d\n\nThe appropriate margin of safety is not static. It may differ across each business that we own based on our degree of uncer-\ntainty over its value, which is a function of the quality of the business.\n\n3. Timeliness: We believe that cheap alone is not a reason to invest, as this can lead to value traps. We seek to identify a spe-\ncific path that will allow a company to achieve its full potential in a timely manner, namely catalysts.\n\nCatalysts are ongoing or potential corporate events or a series of events that accelerate value realisation, situations where\nprice and liquidity are likely to increase. They include mergers, tender offers, spin-offs, litigations, regulatory changes, rights\nofferings, buybacks, activist investor campaigns and many others.\n\nIdeally, in anticipation of a positive catalyst, we want to see sentiment around the stock improving. As stock prices reflect\nexpectations for future financial performance, we always review the stock chart as it will tell us at a glance if we are early on\nthe stock or not. Also, the price trend informs us about market sentiment towards the stock, which is critical to understand-\ning why it may be cheap.\n\nTypically, we see a surge in volume and then in price as we get closer to the catalyst\u2019s realisation. This would indicate that in-\nvestors might be accumulating shares in anticipation of the catalyst playing out. However, a crowded name that has already\noutperformed based on the expectation of a positive catalyst is likely to get a limited reaction if and when the catalyst does\noccur.\n\nTRACK RECORD OF PROVEN RESULTS\n\nOur goal with Top Picks is to compound wealth at a superior rate over the long term, while minimising the risk of permanent losses of\ncapital. We are not trying to be right all the time, but to increase the odds of being right - the hit ratio. Most importantly, we try to make\nmuch more money when we are right than we lose when we are wrong - the win-loss ratio.\n\f"}}
