introduction with such moderate abilities as i possess it is truly surprising that thus i should have influenced to a considerable extent the beliefs of sci entific men on some important points charles darwin last sentence of the autobiography of charles darwin 1809 1882 august 3 1876 ben graham taught me forty five years ago that in investing it is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results warren buffett annual letter to shareholders 1994 volutionary biology as the name suggests is the study of the causes and nature of the evolution of organisms since the beginning of life on earth investing unlike the name suggests is all too often a euphemism for gambling in which the practitioners rarely do better than dart throwing primates superficially there are many other differences between the two fields evolutionary biology is practiced by serious pro fessionals and the investment field is dominated by amateurs who take themselves too seriously knowledge and the quest for truth motivate evolutionary biologists for most investors knowledge and truth be damned so long as their 2 20 is protected evolutionary biologists perform a tremendous amount of research in narrow fields e g secondary contact and genomic ad mixture between rhesus and long tailed macaques in the indochina peninsula 2 investors on the other hand make confident pronouncements e g i think the markets will rise 10 percent this year based on spurious spreadsheets flawed assumptions and inflated egos the biggest difference though is that the two are moving in opposite directions evolutionary biologists continue to be come better at their craft whereas investors continue to get worse in recent years biologists have used darwin s evolutionary theory to explain things like the origin of the human hepatitis virus the consequences of sexual selection acting on female animals the effect of microbiomes on the evolution of animals the link between cultural inheritance among the great apes and darwinian evolution and the effect of gene flow on evolution of species 2 if you explore the evolution section of any scientific journal for example proceedings of the national academy of sci ences available at www pnas org you will be dazzled by the range of research topics and the stunning advances being made by scientists but the investment community it doesn t matter how you look at it the data are ugly really ugly and it shows that we the fund managers are idiots according to a 2021 s p report on the u s equity market called the spiva u s scorecard across periods of five ten and twenty years 75 to 90 percent of u s domestic funds underperformed the market let that fact sink in before you read any fur ther about 75 to 90 percent of fund managers most of whom have graduate degrees including mbas from elite schools and man age trillions of dollars fail to beat the market if you are part of the financial services community you may believe that it is easier to outperform the small cap market benchmarks not true the market outperformed about 93 percent of small cap funds during the ten year period from 2011 to 2021 that is bad enough but the dismal news does not end there not only are most u s funds underperforming but they have also gotten worse over time according to the same s p report in 2009 5 over three and five year periods ten and twenty year pe riods were not reported only 55 to 60 percent of u s domestic funds had underperformed the market this phenomenon is not unique to the united states in the indian equity market as of 2017 43 to 53 percent of large cap funds had underperformed benchmarks over three and five year periods however as of 2020 2 those numbers had become much worse about 70 to 80 percent of large cap funds had been unable to beat their benchmarks over periods of three five and ten years no wonder passively managed funds have been growing at a much faster pace than active mutual funds according toa 2020 deloitte report since 2009 u s passive funds valued at 6 6 trillion in 2018 had grown by more than four times whereas u s active funds valued at 11 4 trillion had grown by less than 1 7 times the reason the performance of u s passive funds handsomely beat that of u s active funds during that period i know you may now be asking the following questions how in the world can an obscure field like evolutionary biology be a solution to this problem what is it that investors overpriced and overvalued mba educations did not teach them that a study of darwinian evolution could what can the folks who worship abstractions like cash flow price earnings pe ratios and capital asset pricing models learn from the people who spend decades digging up fossil specimens argue whether neanderthals had sex with humans and accord a godlike status to a nineteenth century englishman who studied earthworms pigeons and barnacles a lot i will argue but before we get there who am i and why did i write this book who am i iam an equity fund manager in 2007 i founded an investment firm called nalanda capital which currently manages a little more than us 5 billion invested in listed indian securities nalanda s investment philosophy can be summarized in ten words we want to be permanent owners of high quality businesses let me repeat that we want to be permanent owners we don t invest unless we think we can own a business forever a bad business that is dirt cheap pass a mediocre business at a low price thanks but no thanks a high quality business at a fair price give me more so i can never let go we invest almost exclusively in businesses owned and run by entrepreneurs of which the entrepreneur is typically the largest shareholder and we are usually the second largest nalanda s approach to investing comprises three straightforward sequential steps 1 avoid big risks 2 buy high quality at a fair price 3 don t be lazy be very lazy that s it this straightforward investment process has led to the following outcome one rupee inr 1 invested in nalanda s first fund at its inception in june 2007 would have been worth inr 13 8 in september 2022 the same amount invested in india s sen sex the country s large cap index would have been worth inr 3 9 and if invested in the midcap index would have been worth only inr 4 over a little more than fifteen years based on actual cash inflows and outflows the annualized rupee return for this fund was 20 3 percent after all our fees and the fund beat both the sensex and the midcap index by 10 9 percentage points that is not a bad track record before founding nalanda i worked for almost nine years at the global private equity firm warburg pincus before that i spent six years at the management consulting firm mckinsey company serving clients in india south africa and the united states my consulting clients ranged from a south african retail bank a u s technology company and a swiss insurer to an indian conglomerate as an investor i have been on the board of an israeli services company a singaporean food company and an indian telecommunications company among a couple dozen others my investments have been across early stage companies through which i lost money to late stage ones through which i made some money as you can see i haven t done anything i haven t been responsible for meeting production deadlines managing a sales team turning around troubled companies or launching and managing brands what i have done though for almost three decades of my consulting and investing career is observe not being in a day to day operational role has afforded me the luxury of stepping back to think about what works in the corporate world and what doesn t this experience across industries companies and continents may qualify me to pontificate on the peculiarities of a pizza delivery business model but i will not begrudge you for questioning my authority to speak on matters of evolution when i do not have a degree in evolutionary theory my defense is the same as the one given by mary jane west eberhard in her stunningly origi nal book development plasticity and evolution can read 2 iblame my passion for investing on luck i stumbled on this profession in 1998 and for evolutionary theory oddly enough on charlie munger warren buffett s longtime friend and confidant munger was the chair of wesco financial until berkshire hathaway bought it in 2011 like buffett at berkshire s legendary annual meetings munger held forth on a wide range of subjects at wesco s annual meetings in 2000 in response to a question about his favorite books munger recommended the selfish gene by richard dawkins 12i read the notes of this meeting in 2002 and decided to buy the book my life hasn t been the same since i found the subject of darwinian evolution extraordinarily fascinating and enriching thanks to amazon and borders oh i miss you so i have been reading books on the subject for about two decades now these include popular books esoteric books and graduate course books books on insects vertebrates and humans books that deal with highly specialized areas such as genetics and books on the general theory of evolution books on the philosophy of evolution and books that deal only with mathematical concepts applied to evolution yes there is a lot of math in biology 1 i can t say that i am an expert in evolutionary theory but i think i can hold a reasonably coherent conversation on the subject with an expert by the way i can t say i am an expert even in in vesting i can admit only to being a passionate practitioner why this book it was only after i had read dozens of books on evolution that i realized why i was so deeply absorbed in the subject almost every topic i studied in evolutionary biology has parallels to investing in general and to the nalanda way of investing in particular the more i studied darwinian evolution a new hobby the more i learned about investing an old passion this book is about how we can derive the core investment principles of long term and patient investing from the basic con cepts of evolutionary biology the very epitome of a long term process while this is a book on investing it is not an investing 101 book i will not be discussing depreciation methods lease accounting policies or valuing intangibles you can learn those things from hundreds of other sources i will not be dissecting valuation ratios or commenting on off balance sheet accounting i also will not reveal any new investing techniques this book is about adopting a new mindset for investing about reimagining investing by applying the time tested principles of biological evolution i will deliberate the counterintuitive darwinian evolutionary principles that can be called upon to under stand the business world thereby helping investors excel at their craft what you will discover in the following pages is a description not a prescription it s a description of our strategy of invest ing at nalanda and its uncanny parallels to evolutionary theory instead of saying this is what you should do this book says this is what we have done as mentioned most investors have a poor long term track record the implication of this is obvious most investment methods don t work over the long run ours has and so here i am sharing my thoughts with you this book is for many types of readers if you are an amateur investor this book should intrigue you as you discover exciting parallels between the natural world and the world of money second this book is for professional investors who are buffett fans okay agreed everyone is a buffett fan this book is for buffett fans who try to invest the way he does while you may not learn any new tricks here you will learn to visualize buffett s core investment principles in an entirely new light as you peer through the lens of evolutionary biology the third group who may find this book interesting is science buffs most people of science avoid thinking about money like the plague but the opportunity cost of not investing well can be substantial for those individuals this book may nudge you toward thinking more actively about investing your money well especially because the concepts discussed here will resonate with you this book is also for readers with eclectic taste who are looking for something interesting to read you may not find this book to be an agatha christie esque page turner but hopefully your gray cells will be tickled if you are an expert on investing you may not agree with many or all of the investing related topics i discuss and if you are an evolutionary biologist you may scoff at some or all of the themes i present but the great thing about these two vast areas of knowledge is that there are almost no fixed laws in biology or in investing in contrast to the many immutable laws in physics and chemistry just as scientists can t agree on the definition of what constitutes a species or a gene 12 investors have wildly differ ent opinions on calculating something as simple as a business s value the three elements of nalanda s investment strategy in this book i describe one method of long term investing and its parallels with darwinian evolutionary biology the way we in vest at nalanda as permanent owners i have organized the book into three sections that mirror the three elements of our strategy section i avoid big risks section ii buy high quality at a fair price section iii don t be lazy be very lazy section i highlights the most basic investing lesson of all avoid big risks don t lose money like most deceptively simple things in life this is easier said than done yes not losing money is a skill maybe a skill harder to learn than making money as warren buffett has famously said rule number 1 never lose money rule number 2 don t forget rule number 1 have you noticed that almost every book on investing provides strategies and tactics that encourage you to do things a certain way some advise you to trade based on market signals some recommend buying value stocks and some urge you to bet on al and biotech start ups these books are about making money you do not see books telling you how not to jose money the sad reality is that unless an investor learns to avoid losses their investment career is likely to be short and brutal section ii sums up nalanda s second mantra buy high quality at a fair price it focuses on the nuts and bolts of nalanda s buying process as seen from the perspective of darwinian evolutionary theory chapters 2 to 4 deal with what to buy and chapters 5 to 7 explore how to buy section iii covers the third area of nalanda s investment approach don t be lazy be very lazy we buy rarely and we sell even more rarely in this world of nonstop action where nike s slogan just do it seems to be the core mantra of a successful life our core tenet of just don t do it may seem out of place in this section i describe the logic of our laziness by invoking three con cepts from evolutionary theory ithen conclude by drawing a lesson from an intriguing creature that even darwin could not understand the honeybee 2k in the following pages you will encounter many facets of darwinian evolutionary theory that have laid the groundwork for our investing philosophy at nalanda this book is a compendium of analogies as you may have discovered while persuading or being persuaded by someone analogies can be useful for making a case any case so be careful treat the evolution lessons for what they are a plea for investors to think long term very long term section i avoid big risks his section has only one chapter but it is the most important one in this book if for some reason you lose the book after reading chapter 1 i believe you still will have more than gotten your money s worth the problem with our investment community is that we don t take investing seriously seriously those of you who are in the investing profession are probably bristling with indignation right now you travel two hundred days a year work sixty to eighty hours a week deal with irate and demanding clients attend excruciatingly boring conferences your spouse and kids rarely see you and the stress of beating the markets is making you look ten years older than your actual age and i have the temerity to tell you that you are not taking your job seriously well if you are so angry answer this question for me would you bet your life on your next investment in this chapter i discuss how betting your life is a remarkably sound strategy for investing and how adopting this ap proach has led to the spectacular success of all living organisms over millions of years all the investment advice from well known books investment gurus and finance academics centers on making invest ments this chapter is about not making investments i will argue that learning the skill of not investing is harder and more im portant than learning how to invest chapter 1 oh to be a bumblebee on the other hand in some cases as with the elephant and rhinoceros none are destroyed by beasts of prey even the tiger in india most rarely attacks a young elephant protected by its dam charles darwin on the origin of species chapter 3 struggle for existence we have written in past reports about the disappointments that usually result from purchases and operation of turnaround businesses literally hundreds of turnaround possibilities in dozens of industries have been described to us over the years and either as participants or observers we have tracked performance against expectations our conclusion is that with few exceptions when a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics it is the reputation of the business that re mains intact warren buffett annual letter to shareholders 1980 hen you start reading a book on investing i assume you want to be dazzled by the author s brilliance it won t happen this time i will begin this journey by profiling my stupidity after spending six years at mckinsey i joined warburg pincus a global private equity firm after a few years of investing i had learned the basics or at least i thought i had they appeared simple invest in a high quality entrepreneur run ning a growth business and don t overpay i had lucked out on a couple of investments by then and so was flying high an entrepreneur running a successful business approached us to raise funds for expansion in the early 2000s the business had a reasonable scale by indian standards and the company had many marquee clients including one of india s largest busi nesses notably this company had also made inroads in overseas markets it wasn t common to see indian companies outside the software services industry build a thriving export business in those days i started our diligence process and did the usual spent time with the founder and senior managers to understand their strategy and competitive differentiation visited the company offices talked to several customers in india and europe employed a firm specializing in forensic diligence to assess governance issues hired the leading legal and accounting firms in india to perform diligence and quizzed some industry experts on the company s potential for growth and value creation everything was looking good and i didn t even have to haggle much on valuation or the legal documents icommunicated my enthusiasm to my bosses and got the green light the company raised 50 million a big sum of money for a private equity investment in india at the time and i enthusiastically led the investment warburg pincus s return on this in vestment zero the firm lost all its money it was entirely my fault i had screwed up big time before making money learn not to lose money the next time you are in a bookshop go to the section with investing books many of you below the age of thirty probably don t know what a bookshop is no worries go to amazon and type in investment books do you notice anything common across titles that scream things like investing 101 or one up on wall street or you can be a stock market genius or new era value investing all of them are about how to make money duh what else is an investing book supposed to teach i hope to convince you that an essential prerequisite for making money is the ability not to lose money almost everyone and i say almost because this statement does not apply to my wife makes mistakes these errors fall into two broad categories we do things we are not supposed to and we don t do things we are supposed to for me buying a hot fudge sundae at mcdonald s falls into the first category and not keeping in regular touch with my school and college friends falls into the second all investors too make these two mistakes let me borrow from the field of statistics to describe them the first kind dubbed a type i error by statisticians who can never be blamed for being creative occurs when i make a bad investment because i erroneously think it is a good one it is the error of committing self harm and is also called a false positive or error of commission atype ii error occurs when i reject a good investment because i erroneously think it is bad this is the error of rejecting a potential benefit and can be termed a false negative or error of omission every investor including warren buffett makes these two errors ona regular basis they either harm themselves or walk away from a great opportunity as any statistician will tell you the risk of these two errors is inversely related 2 minimizing the risk of a type i error typically increases the risk of a type ii error and minimizing the risk of a type ii error increases the risk of a type i error intuitively this seems logical imagine an overly optimistic investor who sees an upside in almost every investment this individual will make sev eral type i errors by committing to bad investments but also will not miss out on the few good investments on the other hand an overly cautious investor who keeps finding reasons to reject every investment is likely to make very few bad investments but will lose out on some good investments investors can t have their cake and eat it too they need to choose to be more sensitive to making one type of error while living with the consequences of making more errors of the other kind what should one do what should you do in other words which of the following investment strategies should you use 1 making a lot of investments so as not to lose out on some good opportunities and as a result living with some failed investments or 2 being highly selective to avoid making bad investments thereby missing out on some good investments let s turn to evolution to seek the answer the goal of all animals is to survive for as long as possible at least until they reproduce in the animal world everyone is both prey and predator yes even we the homo sapiens how are we prey remember covid 19 let s start with the prey what would be a typei error for a prey animal it would equate to inflicting sufficient harm on itself to compromise its fitness let me illustrate the case of an adult male deer to explore two kinds of type i errors the first kind occurs when the deer is thirsty and is near a watering hole borne by instinct or experience or both the deer knows that the watering hole could sound its death knell if a lion or leopard or crocodile is hiding waiting for the opportunity of an easy meal if the deer chooses to approach the watering hole it slakes its thirst quickly and then moves away and if it mistak enly draws near while a predator is ready and waiting its life ends from the fossil record we know that the deer that we see today evolved from ungulates about fifteen to thirty million years ago 2 they have survived millions of years amid ferocious predators by being very sensitive to making type i errors errors of not being too careful if they weren t so the species would have become extinct obviously some individual deer do end up making the fatal error of commission by drinking at watering holes when predators are present but the species as a whole has done remark ably well if you have seen african wildlife videos or gone on a safari you will have noticed how vigilant wildebeests antelopes zebras and other herbivores are they seem to see danger where there is none but it is this alertness that has allowed them to sur vive and thrive for millions of years a type i error of underestimating a threat could be the last error one of these animals makes the second kind of type i error that the deer can commit is seen in mating rituals one fascinating sight in the wild for me and dare i say for the female deer is two adult male deer fighting over the exclusive control of a harem let me describe the mating behavior of the red deer found in many parts of europe and in western and central asia the males are called stags and the fe males hinds the hinds live in groups called harems stags armed with impressively large antlers fight with one another to gain exclusive mating rights to the harem females i have put the word fight in quotation marks because the stags rarely end up fight ing physically a type i error or the error of commission in this scenario would be the mistake of committing to fighting thereby risking becoming injured or disabled although the prize of a harem is quite substantial the stags show extreme sensitivity to the type i error by dueling very rarely here is how it works stags are capable of mating when they reach the age of about sixteen months but they don t usually mate for the first time until they are at least six years old this is because they don t develop large and powerful antlers before this age they could fight and take a chance but none do they could get seriously hurt which could compromise their fitness for future mating or even their life when they do reach mating age they approach the rutting grounds where hinds have gathered but they don t start fighting immediately scientists have observed that locking antlers is almost always the last resort and a rutting stag will typically fight only five times during the three weeks of the rut a series of highly choreographed rituals that serve to actively discourage phys ical contact precedes the locking of horns when two stags challenge each other one emits an impressive roar the other then responds with seemingly equal vigor because sound quality is a reliable indicator of the strength of one s rival the roaring may go on for more than an hour with the number of roars peaking at three to four per minute at this stage based on the quality of roars one of the stags typically withdraws if they are unable to decide their relative strengths based on roars they move on to the next stage of the fight by walking with stiff legs parallel to each other yes they threaten their opponent by walking this parallel walking spectacle lasts many min utes during which time the rivals assess each other s strength and physical condition from a distance of about two meters during this period they also thrash the vegetation and roar to appear more intimidating to their rival again one may choose to withdraw at this stage only if both stags refuse to back down do they choose to clash antlers to me it seems more like a push and shove match this show most of these interactions don t look like a real brawl can last several minutes at the end of which one stag admits defeat and runs away if this were a human boxing match the crowd would trash the arena because the boxers would be screaming and hitting the ground instead of each other stags have found great evolutionary success because at each stage of the contest they minimize the error of committing self harm they do not even attempt to duel until they have big enough antlers and even after acquiring their deadly weapons they refuse to engage until they believe they have more than a fair chance of winning even their duel is not deadly scientists have observed that only about 5 percent of rutting stags receive permanent injuries the bottom line is that the stags evolutionary success at least in part can be attributed to their instinct to preserve life and limb to minimize the risk of committing a type i error but there is a significant trade off to the approach of minimizing the risk of type i errors the deer make many more type ii errors a type ii error or the error of omission means avoiding a watering hole where no predator is waiting stags also too often withdraw from a rutting duel when they have a good chance of winning the harem the cost is the lost opportunity to drink water or to mate in some cases a type ii error may turn out to be a fatal mistake a thirsty deer may not be able to run quickly enough to escape a predator and an overcautious stag may not get to pass his genes on to the next generation but on average making this trade off in favor of reducing the number of errors of self harm while tolerating a higher number of errors of rejecting potential benefit has worked quite well for the species committing a type i error can be and has been deadlier than the loss of a single animal it can lead to the extinction of an entire species the flightless dodo bird a native of mauritius was first spotted by sailors in 1507 and went extinct by 1681 5 dodos were bigger than turkeys and since they had no natural predators on the isolated island they were not afraid of the human invaders they committed the cardinal type i error they did not avoid the humans when they should have which led to their extinction let s now turn our attention to the predator the predator too can make two types of error it can commit itself to killing prey that turns out to be too dangerous or too large or too fast type i error or it can refrain from attacking prey that it could easily have killed type ii error which error do you think a predator makes more often acheetah is the fastest mammal on earth and routinely achieves speeds of eighty to one hundred kilometers per hour while chasing prey it sacrifices size and bulk for speed a cheetah typically weighs 34 to 54 kilograms 75 to 120 pounds which is significantly less than a lion whose weight typically ranges from 170 to 230 kilograms 375 to 500 pounds hence a cheetah usu ally preys on smaller animals like birds rabbits and small antelopes a cheetah will never attempt to kill an adult water buffalo a favorite prey of lions the cheetah is simply trying to avoid getting hurt committing a type i error will lead either to death water buffalos can turn on their hunters aggressively or wasted energy when a cheetah chases an antelope that was too far away to begin with these mistakes in turn will lead to hunger and poorer hunting performance for a cheetah mother a type i error can also lead to the death of her offspring the fact the species has been successful for eons demonstrates that cheetahs as a species have not committed too many type i errors a type ii error for a cheetah would mean not chasing prey it should have this would leave the cheetah and maybe even her babies hungry but they would all live to see another day deer and cheetahs do not manufacture complex decision tree diagrams with associated probabilities to make decisions in their lives these animals do what they do because natural selection has honed their instincts over countless generations natural selection among animals is incessant and merciless and has produced millions of species all of whom adhere to this simple princi ple minimize the risk of committing type i errors to curtail the risk of injury or death and learn to live with type ii errors or fore gone benefits what about plants the ultimate source of all life on earth plants have been immensely successful evolutionarily the first land plants appeared in the ordovician era about 490 million years ago and there are about 400 000 plant species found on our green planet 2 unlike animals the dramas of whose lives play out on african safaris on wildlife tv channels and in children s books plants may seem uninteresting sedate peaceful and inactive nothing could be further from the truth look closely and you will notice that the life of a plant in many ways is more exciting and action packed than that of almost any animal paradoxically this is because plants can t move if they are malnour ished they can t move to a different location to feed when attacked by herbivores they don t have feet to run or claws to fight back when infected by pathogens they can t be offered treatment and cuddles like we humans can plants can choose to commit resources broadly to two areas defending against attacks or growing as with deer and cheetahs any error that significantly compromises life or fitness for a plant can be categorized as a type i error since the lack of a proper defense may prove fatal to a plant a type i error or an error of commission occurs when the plant does not devote re sources to protecting itself a type ii error occurs when a plant directs energy toward preservation when it should have invested in growth this error of omission may not kill the plant but may compromise its ability to grow and reproduce relative to its competitors ample evidence from nature suggests that plants avoid type i errors at the cost of committing more type ii errors let s ex amine how plants handle insect herbivores the first defense of plants against insects is physical structures like wax thorns and trichomes a trichome is the layer of hairs on leaves stems and fruits and can be spiral straight hooked or glandular a dense trichome on a leaf impedes the move ment of insects and their larvae thereby reducing their ability to damage the leaf epidermis trichomes in glandular form can secrete poisonous or otherwise harmful chemicals like flavonoids and alkaloids which repel insects some glandular trichomes can also trap insects producing and maintaining trichomes is metabolically expensive for a plant and prevents it from making additional leaves stems or fruits thus when there are few or no insects we should expect trichomes to be tiny or nonexistent but when there is an insect attack to reduce the risk of a type i error erroneously investing in growth instead of preparing defenses we should expect the plant to start making trichomes and this is what we see for example scientists have observed that when adult leaf beetles attack the willow plant new leaves grown after the attack develop higher trichome density the willow plant redirects its resources from growth to defense as a result of sensing a predator trichome density also increases in other species like pepperwort and wild radish after an insect attack when a butterfly species attacks a black mustard plant the trichome density of the plant s leaves in creases as does the production of pungent chemicals called glucosinolates within a few days or weeks following an insect attack trichome density can increase from 25 to 1 000 percent aplant s defense mechanisms are not limited to trichomes however lignin is a phenol compound that plays a vital role in a plant s defense against insects lignin does two things to the leaves it increases their toughness thereby making them unpalat able and it reduces their nutritional content a leaf with excess lignin would be anathema for insects just as with trichomes it is costly to produce lignin also as with trichomes the plant ramps up its lignin production after an insect attack in addition to lignin compounds called flavonoids tannins lectins and peroxidases also serve to reduce the risk of plants committing type i er rors by directing resources to defense rather than growth what i have described are direct defenses against pests but many plants also resort to indirect defenses which are rarely seen in animals an indirect defense works on the simple principle that my enemy s enemy is my friend 2 it works simply and beautifully like this when a plant senses an insect attack it releases some chemical compounds from its leaves flowers and fruits into the atmosphere these chemical compounds attract predators of the insects attacking the plants for example plants like lima beans and arabidopsis release a chemical called methyl salicylate to attract insect predators like big eyed bugs ladybird beetles commonly known as ladybugs and green lacewings this trick is not limited to the aerial parts of plants roots too can release chemicals that attract underground predators to underground pests for example when western corn rootworm threatens maize plants the maize roots release a chemical that attracts a nematode species that preys upon the rootworm when aphids attack many plants emit a chemical called beta farnesene it does not appear to be a coincidence that when predators attack aphids the aphids release this chemical presumably warning other aphids to stay away thus a plant releasing beta farnesene is equivalent to a deer mimicking a lion roar when attacked by a leopard plants like animals have found a way to their spectacular evolutionary success by focusing on reducing their errors of commission in other words like their animal counterparts they avoid taking risks to their life and well being at the cost of giving up some potentially juicy opportunities buffett s two rules of investing as one should expect warren buffett figured out this lesson from evolutionary theory before almost everyone else he famously coined his two rules of investing as follows rule number 1 never lose money rule number 2 never forget rule number 1 12 but wait a minute what does he mean by commanding us to never lose money how can one choose not to lose money isn t that what every investor wants why would any investor deliberately wish to lose money in fact buffett seems to have violated his own two rules on many occasions for example in 1993 berkshire bought dexter shoe for 433 million in berkshire stock as he detailed in his 2007 annual letter what i had assessed as a durable competitive advantage vanished within a few years that move made the cost to berkshire shareholders not 400 million but rather 3 5 billion in essence i gave away 1 6 percent of a wonderful business one now valued at 220 billion to buy a worthless business in his 2014 annual letter he admitted his mistake in berkshire s tesco investment we sold tesco shares throughout the year and now are out of this position our after tax loss from this investment was 444 million more recently in the middle of the covid 19 pandemic market meltdown buffett sold all his airline stocks he had invested between 7 billion and 8 billion for large stakes in four airlines american delta southwest and united berkshire s position was worth a bit more than 4 billion at the time of his sale it turned out i was wrong he said back to buffett s two rules despite losing money occasionally what is he asking us to do when he orders us not to lose any buffett has never explicitly explained this at least i have never found an explanation but this is what i think he means avoid big risks don t make type i errors don t commit to an investment in which the probability of losing money is higher than the probabil ity of making money think about risk first not return before we go any further allow mea slight digression to get the definition of risk out of the way the definition i use in this book is not the same as the one defined by corporate finance theorists finance theory claims that risk is the chance that the actual investment return will differ from the expected investment return 12 thus if an asset is highly volatile it will be classified as riskier than an asset that is not as volatile if you think about this for a moment you will conclude that this is nonsensical for any investor risk should simply be the probability of incurring a capital loss the following example will make this clear let s say i am evaluating an investment in a high quality grocery retailer the retailer has been performing quite well resulting in a steadily increasing stock price over the years let s say the market price was 90 in early 2020 after the covid 19 crisis the stock market became highly volatile and the market price of this business dropped to 30 let s also assume that you have done your work and have concluded that grocery retailers may benefit from the crisis since consumers will stock up their pantries which would be a riskier investment investing in the business at 90 or at 30 if your intuition says 90 you are right this is because the risk of losing money is greater at 90 than at 30 but believe it or not academics of finance would argue exactly the opposite no iam not kidding they would con clude that the post covid 19 crisis business is riskier because the volatility of the stock price has increased we at nalanda never bring stock price volatility into a risk discussion we define risk as the probability of capital loss the higher the probability of loss the higher the risk if my investment in company a is likely to lose more money over my investment in company b i will deem company a to be riskier than company b irrespective of past or future volatility in their stock prices as buffett s diktat shows he is focused on minimizing risk and in doing so has become the envy of the entire investment world which seems obsessed with running after every half baked business idea buffett and the natural world are fixated on min imizing the risk of type i errors should we follow them blindly will the explicit lesson from buffett and the implicit one from leopards and legumes work for ordinary mortals like us why or why not a great investor is a great rejector let s walk through a simple example that contrasts two different investment styles and let s then see if buffett s advice makes sense according to data from the world bank the united states had 4 400 listed companies in 2018 12 for simplicity let s assume around 4 000 first we need to decide how many of these are good investments let s keep it simple and classify a good invest ment as one that will make us a decent return over the long run it has a competent and honest management team a modest growth rate makes enough money and has low leverage if you are a finance nerd you are probably bristling at this moment what in the world do i mean by vague terms like decent enough and competent don t worry we will get into numbers shortly but at this stage let s just say we know a good investment when we see it let s assume that 25 percent of the listed universe comprises good investments if you talk to practitioners that is actual investors you will not get a number too far from this percentage in any event the exact percentage is less significant as we will see thus we can say there are 1 000 good investments and 3 000 bad investments in the u s listed universe by this logic again don t get too pained about this strict dichotomy it is serving a purpose that we will get to let s say you encounter a savvy investor who claims that he is right 80 percent of the time in his investment decisions it is usually a he we men are evolutionarily programmed for empty exaggerations stated differently if he encounters a bad invest ment i e one in which he will not make any money he rejects it 80 percent of the time if he sees a good investment i e one in which he will make money he makes a favorable investment decision 80 percent of the time thus his rates of type i and type ii errors are both 20 percent if this star investor makes an investment decision what is the probability that it is a good investment you d say 80 percent right wrong the answer is 57 percent but why isn t he right 80 percent of the time how can we go from 80 percent to 57 percent here is how there are 1 000 good investments in the market and since this investor makes a type ii error 20 percent of the time i he mistakenly rejects 20 percent of these he will select only 800 companies from his list the market also has 3 000 bad invest ments and since he makes type i errors 20 percent of the time i e he mistakenly accepts 20 percent of these he will mistakenly select 600 companies from this list thinking that they are good investments thus his universe of what he thinks are good invest ments will be 1 400 companies 800 600 are you with me good now to the most interesting part of these 1 400 businesses that the investor thinks are good investments how many do you think are good investments only 800 hence the probability of his making a good investment will be 800 1 400 57 percent so here is the unfortunate conclusion even if an investor is endowed with the divine power of being right 80 percent of the time the probability that he will select a good investment is only 57 percent even though he is right 80 percent of the time 43 percent of his investments will turn out to be bad the reason is simple especially when we incorporate our prior knowledge of the business world there are very few good investments in the market let me repeat this statement which is the bedrock of our philosophy and that of the rest of this book there are very few good investments in the market as we have just seen the prevalence of type i and type ii errors can lull us investors into thinking that we are better than we really are but these errors carry a deeper meaning for our profession given a choice which error would you like to reduce and why let s say that our investor investor a decides to become better at rejecting bad investments and reduces his rate of type i errors from 20 percent to 10 percent thus from the 3 000 bad investments in the market he will select only 300 businesses 10 percent x 3 000 as his type ii error rate remains 20 percent he will erroneously reject 200 of the 1 000 good investments thereby selecting 800 investments thus investor a has selected 1 100 investments 300 800 but only 800 of these are good in this scenario investor a s probability of selecting a good investment improves from 57 percent to 73 percent 800 1 100 i assume you will admit that this is quite a dramatic improvement in his success rate investor b unlike investor a is more focused on not missing out on good opportunities he chooses to reduce his rate of type il errors from 20 percent to 10 percent and keeps his rate of type i errors at 20 percent thus of the 1 000 good investments he will select 900 90 percent x 1 000 and of the 3 000 bad investments he will mistakenly assume that 600 are good 20 percent x 3 000 thus investor b has selected 1 500 investments 600 900 but only 900 are good thus investor b s probability of se lecting a good business improves from 57 percent to 60 percent 900 1 500 this is an improvement but only by 3 percentage points good but not great the relative impact of reducing each type of error is quite stark as shown in table 1 1 table 1 1 type land ii errors typelerror type il error success rate 20 20 57 10 20 73 20 10 60 thus there is a 16 percentage point improvement in investor performance by reducing the rate of type i errors from 20 percent to 10 percent on the other hand reducing the rate of type ii errors by the same amount improves performance by only 3 percentage points guess what happens if another investor investor c improves his rate of both type i and type ii errors from 20 percent to 10 percent i was flabbergasted when i first saw the answer 75 percent this is barely above the 73 percent achieved by investor a who was focused only on reducing type i errors a dramatic improvement in performance comes only when the rate of type i er rors errors of making bad investments is reduced thus whereas most investment books and college curricula focus on teaching how to make good investments everyone would be better off by learning how not to make bad investments an investment career is probably among the very few that re wards the skeptic more than the optimist buffett is the best investor in the world because he is the best rejector in the world how to avoid big risks it s all well and good to assert that we should learn from the evolutionary success of animals and plants to avoid big risks and be come better investors but how there are myriad ways of learning life lessons parents siblings one s spouse friends books movies school college work and leaders are a few sources that come to mind i will never really know why i am what i am but i am reasonably confident of the identity of my primary teacher and guide in the area of investing my own mistakes early in my investing career at warburg pincus i committed the cardinal sin of minimizing errors of omission instead of trying to control type i errors i was too afraid to miss out on good opportunities i founded nalanda after gaining more than eight years of investing experience our reasonable success of staying away from trouble is the result of the follies of the first three to four years of my career in my case nothing has succeeded like a failure most investors will keep making type i errors making bad investments throughout their careers at least i have and i will it s inevitable so when i say that we need to avoid type i errors i am proposing that we try to avoid the avoidable type i error by not taking on big risks what is a big risk it is not clear to me that a definition is possible or even desirable for a practitioner in stead of defining big risk let me describe the kinds of situations we avoid at nalanda this is not an exhaustive list but hopefully it will give you a good sense of the kinds of risks we don t price being wary of criminals crooks and cheats people don t change especially criminals crooks and cheats as permanent owners we at nalanda have no interest in a business owned or run by someone who defrauds customers suppliers employees or shareholders when we come across such a person we don t ask if the business is cheap enough for the risk to be mitigated we don t ask if we could persuade this individual to change we don t ask if their crimes are trivial enough to ignore we simply walk away i don t know about other countries but the indian capital market i am sad to admit teems with dodgy and deceitful pro moters indian parlance for the largest or controlling shareholders as a result we are highly vigilant and do not even start assess ing the business fundamentals until we have convinced ourselves that the promoters have impeccable integrity a kpmg report on the indian private equity pe industry euphemistically claimed many risks are common to all emerging markets political and regulatory uncertainty and weak corporate governance among them many of these risks are more likely in india even if they are not unique such as working with family owned businesses navigating ipo exits and compliance risks this was a polite way of saying beware of being swindled we employ a two level process for this assessment we always hire a forensic diligence expert to assess if the owner or senior managers have a dubious past during this period we conduct our parallel diligence on the promoters and managers by scouring the media studying past annual reports listening to their conference call recordings reading their interviews and talking to people who have had personal and business dealings with them in almost half the cases we ask the external firm to further probe issues that have arisen during our diligence for example money leakage for large capex contracts or a cash payment to senior managers this dual check provided by outsourcing and insourcing has prevented a lot of heartburn for us over the years more importantly it has saved a lot of money for our investors but shouldn t this be obvious there is nothing extraordinarily insightful about claiming that one needs to check for promoters integrity before committing capital you are right governance checks in india should be par for the course but they are not let s take an example of investing in the infrastructure and real estate sectors in india these two industries are highly regulated involve a lot of cash transactions and require a plethora of approvals hence over the years they have attracted a set of entrepreneurs who can success fully manage the system looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack would be a cakewalk compared to finding infrastruc ture and real estate entrepreneurs who don t mistreat minority shareholders we have chosen to avoid these industries completely when we launched nalanda in 2007 it was a boom time for fundraising in the real estate and infrastructure sectors accord ing toa mckinsey report from 2005 to 2008 real estate absorbed almost a quarter of all pe investments and infrastructure s share was nearly 30 percent 15 a relatively large portion of these ended up in a disaster and pe and public market investors lost billions of dollars real estate returns on exit were only 2 percent and only 9 percent of energy segment investments could get an exit one key reason for this unfortunate outcome was the adverse selection of entrepreneurs by the fund management community but it would be hypocritical of me to complain about others when i too have fallen into the same trap let s go back to the business for which i led the investment of 50 million from warburg pincus and which seemed to have ticked all the boxes here is what i did not tell you on the first page of this chapter the governance check from the outsourced firm had given a clean chit to the promoter but our internal team had heard some informal negative buzz about him it wasn t strong or unequivocal but it was buzz nevertheless i ignored it i am still not sure why maybe i trusted our outsourced provider more than i should have maybe i had become arrogant owing to recent successes maybe i had been too charmed by the smooth talking promoter maybe i was in too deep after completing many months of diligence or maybe all of the above at this stage i should have gone back to our service provider and asked them to do more work i also should have dug deeper into the veracity of the criticisms of the promoter i didn t do either of these things it was too late by the time we discovered this individual s shenanigans he had sucked the company dry and warburg lost almost all its money since this incident i have been extra cautious both at warburg and at nalanda we never invest unless we are fully and absolutely satisfied with the governance standards we haven t lost a single dollar at nalanda yet on dodgy promoters but this doesn t mean we never will but if we ever do it will not be because we didn t do our best some investors may object that if the company s survival is not under threat owing to the bad behavior of the promoter investing in a somewhat shady business at a very cheap valuation may be a good way of making money over the medium to long term the fact remains that there are some well known dodgy businesses in india whose stock prices have done reasonably well over the past few years but we have never played this game and never will our philosophy of permanent ownership requires de mands that we partner only with promoters of the highest integrity and so that is what we do avoiding turnarounds imagine a tennis match in which roger federer is playing john who is ranked 500 in the world i ask you to bet 5 percent of your wealth on john winning the match you refuse i hope but john wants you to bet on him and so before the match starts ina face to face meeting with you john makes an impassioned plea to ignore his ranking and recognize his innate talent he speaks eloquently and makes a slick powerpoint presentation on his plan to defeat federer john says he has been watching federer s game very closely for the past two years and his plan he believes is exemplary to bolster his claim john invites one of the leading ten nis coaches in the world who admits that john s plan is laudable and that he has a real chance of beating federer it s decision time for you would you bet 5 percent of your wealth on john this is exactly what happens in the world of investing managements that have underperformed for long periods are able to convince investors to bet on their businesses with nothing but fancy promises and mckinsey reports i blame neither man agements nor mckinsey because optimism is not a crime but i do get baffled at investors who despite having access to data that amply demonstrate the incompetence of incumbent management are willing to bet their clients money on the hope that this management will suddenly morph into an industry beater in the near future more often than not the dream scenario hyped up by the management morphs into a nightmare occasionally the board or the owner fires the previous ceo and brings in a new one to turn around a struggling business the new ceo usually comes with an impressive resume and many are highly qualified but we don t bet on these turnarounds ei ther an exceptional ceo was impressive in a certain context with a certain business this context and this business are different how are we to know that the new ceo faced with a set of challenges they have almost certainly never met before will do what they are promising to do we don t i know what you are thinking the upside if we were able to detect a genuine turnaround would be significant agreed let s assess the following two situations case 1 acompany that has been very profitable over many decades has recently fallen prey to smaller and more nimble competitors it has suffered massive losses over the past two years the company sells its highly engineered products to medium and large businesses the board starts searching for a new ceo and identifies a promising candidate there are however a few worrying problems with this choice the candidate does not understand technology he does not understand how to sell to busi nesses because he has run a company that sells biscuits to consumers and he has had no experience turning around any busi ness let alone a complex engineering one like this would you invest in this business once this ceo takes over case 2 a venerated hundred year old department store has been struggling with falling sales over the past four years sales have fallen 10 percent from 20 billion to 18 billion and the operating income has plummeted about 65 percent from 1 1 billion to 380 million the stock price has crashed from 81 to 32 the board appoints one of the world s leading retail experts as the new ceo of this business he has had two great successes in the past few years as vp of merchandising at one of the largest u s retailers he made the store appeal to young and trendy consumers he also struck several designer partnerships that were a huge hit with shoppers his next job was at a large company where he was responsible for opening retail stores he hit the ball completely out of the park the sales per square foot at these stores now exceeds even luxury retailers like lvmh his innovations in design and service at these stores were so popular that shoppers now need to book an appointment many days in advance in many cities across the world would you invest in this business once this ceo takes over i would not buy the shares of the first business but would load up on the second i assume dear reader that you would do the same we would both be dead wrong you and i would have missed out on a seven fold increase in stock price over the next ten years in the first business we would have been wiped out completely yes with a 100 percent loss in the second the first business is ibm and its famous turnaround in the late 1990s was led by lou gerstner the ex ceo of rjr nabisco 1 previously called international business machines ibm was a behemoth that ruled the world of technology in the latter half of the twentieth century in the early 1990s about half its revenues came from huge mainframe computers sold to businesses these mainframes had hardware and software bundled into one system the world however was fast shifting to smaller and midsized machines running on microprocessors the technology universe was witnessing the unbundling of hardware and software with different vendors specializing in each segment companies like hp sun compaq and dell were eating ibm s lunch on hardware and microsoft and oracle were starting to dominate software to make matters worse individual consumers had started buying personal computers in which ibm had no expertise or experience the company also had a huge internal bureaucracy that hobbled decision making from being the second most profitable company in the world in 1990 ibm lost 16 billion between 1991 and 1993 lou gerstner seemed like a strange choice for the board to make but it worked wonders gerstner resorted to a massive cut in expenses by laying off staff sold many assets to raise cash transformed the organizational culture to encourage business units to cooperate and not compete linked the compensation of senior managers to overall company performance created a single brand message for all units of ibm and much more ibm s stock price jumped seven times from 13 to 77 during his tenure from april 1 1993 to december 31 2002 if you want to learn more about gerstner s miracles i urge you to read his book who says ele phants can t dance inside ibm s historic turnaround the second business is jcpenney where ron johnson credited with transforming target and creating the iconic apple stores was brought in as ceo in late 2011 12 the stock price jumped 24 percent at the news the market was betting that johnson would be the miracle cure for jcpenney he changed everything at the company the logo the store design the advertisements the pricing model and the popular private labels jcpenney was known for coupons and clearance sales johnson ended them big mistake in 2012 sales dropped 25 percent from 17 billion to 13 billion as customers abandoned the stores en masse more worryingly the company suffered an operating loss of 1 3 billion the board fired johnson in mid 2013 just seventeen months after installing him as ceo the stock price had dropped 60 percent during his short tenure jcpenney never recovered from this fiasco and filed for bankruptcy in may 2020 if we could not predict the fate of turnaround efforts at what appeared to be slam dunk cases ibm and jcpenney what hope do we have in situations that don t seem so clear cut the corporate world is brutally competitive even the best companies have to run hard just to stay in the same place how could the probability of success at a troubled company be anything but minuscule and if so why would we indulge in the fantasy detesting debt as a consultant in the early 1990s i almost always focused on the profit and loss p l account revenue cost profit almost nothing else mattered remarkably a consultant s p l obsession remains intact my niece is currently a consultant in london and primarily serves private equity clients she is hyper focused on just one aspect of p l ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization p l obsession is not limited to consultants read any analyst report or listen to conference call recordings that discuss quarterly results you will be inundated with comments and questions on revenues costs and profit after many years of investing i realized that i needed to focus as much if not more on the company s balance sheet re ceivables inventory payables fixed assets and most important of all debt corporate finance theory has a thing for leverage for those of you who are not familiar with it finance academics claim that companies need to have an optimal level of leverage to improve returns if a company can borrow money to purchase assets its return on equity and earnings per share should improve mathematically this is undoubtedly true realistically this is undoubtedly dangerous what could be more important than improving short term return on equity and earnings per share for a business in my view two things start with the easy one survival there is no point in improving return on equity by a few percentage points if it compro mises long term survival the covid 19 crisis demonstrated clearly that the companies caught with their pants down were the ones with substantial leverage in the second quarter of 2020 the following are just some of the well known companies that an nounced bankruptcy gold s gym hertz intelsat j crew jcpenney neiman marcus and sur la table 12 here is what is common across all these names all had a large amount of debt it is not impossible for an unleveraged business to go belly up but it sure is quite hard if i were to list the twenty biggest bankruptcies in the united states 2 you would notice that allj with lehman at the top and lyondellbasell at number 20 were heavily indebted one might argue that these businesses were unlucky and that everything would have been fine if there had been no covid 19 one might also contend that mismanagement or other factors contributed more to their downfall than debt and that correlation is not causation maybe but it s one hell of a correlation as a long term investor in a business i don t want the com pany ever to go bankrupt whether the times are good or bad i can live with a slightly lower return on equity and lower earnings per share eps growth but at least i will live not having high leverage probably makes sense to everyone but the following may not i am an advocate of no leverage more than 90 percent of our portfolio companies have and have always had excess cash only three businesses out of about thirty in our portfolio have some debt but even this debt is quite small the maximum debt equity ratio among these three is 0 3 why would i demand zero debt when a modest level would not compromise the survival of the business the answer lies in the following business insider headline no layoff asian paints will give salary increments to boost employees morale 2 asian paints is india s largest paints business and probably one of the country s best run businesses as an aside it is sadly not in our portfolio i had a chance to buy it during the global financial crisis of 2008 but i refused to pay 15 percent more for the privilege of owning this marvelous compounder i was a fool anyway let s return to a more pleasant topic this no layoff salary increment story would not be newsworthy in normal times but this announcement was made on may 15 2020 at the time india had been under an almost complete lockdown since mid march as a result of the covid 19 pandemic every business was witnessing a catastrophic decline in revenues and profits also no one had any visibility as to when the situation would improve remember that the possibility of vaccines wasn t even on the horizon in may 2020 asian paints was itself going through a catastrophic quarter during the period from april to june 2020 the company s revenue declined by 43 per cent and its net profit went down by 67 percent compared to the same period in 2019 was the company foolish to be increasing salaries in this period no just cash rich in march 2020 at the start of the pandemic the company had 220 million cash its rev enue for the year ended march 2020 was 2 9 billion which brings me to the second reason i detest any debt this answer is often underappreciated and even ignored by investors and management it is this debt diminishes strategic flexibility and hence long term value creation for a day trader or even an investor whose holding period ranges from three to five years a reasonable amount of leverage may not matter but for a permanent owner like nalanda any constraint that prevents a business from taking calculated strategic bets is undesirable asian paints is the leader in the highly competitive indian paints industry its competitors can and do copy what the business is trying to do however every few years the company gets an opportunity to make an investment or take a strategic bet that its competitors find hard to emulate the salary increase was one such bet but it did not stop there the company sanitized its dealers paint shops without charging any fees offered medical insurance to its painters gave forty five day extensions on pay ments to its dealers and announced relief worth more than 5 million to its contractors the ceo amit syngle pointed out we have been debt free for years and are quite comfortably placed even if the uncertainty goes on for the next four or five months 22 the impact of the company s largesse may not be felt in the short term but the long term impact is likely to be significant asian paints was able to commit to these highly unusual actions only because apart from their exceptional strategic vision they had no debt the global pandemic is an extreme case and one may assert that it would be foolhardy to keep excess cash on hand for a once in a century event but this premise is false bad things happen to businesses at remarkably regular intervals the harsh reality of companies in any capitalist society and the reason to always have cash is not that things can go wrong but that they do go wrong businesses suffer adversity across a wide range of situations the macroeconomic environment can become a stiff headwind as in the global financial crisis of 2008 or a recession the industry can suffer a cyclical downturn a well funded com petitor can start overspending on advertising or giving discounts the company can lose some of its best employees to competitors one or more major customers can leave or go belly up consumer tastes can suddenly change a large strategic acquisition or invest ment may not pay off a factory can catch fire or a supplier may get in trouble currency can move adversely in a foreign market that contributes to significant sales regulations can get in the way the company can get sued for a significant amount i could go onandon none of these issues is hypothetical i have seen all of these happen to our portfolio companies over more than two decades of investing occasionally two or more problems can arise simultaneously putting significant pressure on businesses while worrying about market share loss low supplier commitment competitor aggression and employee dissatisfaction the last thing management should worry about is interest payments in my experience only when the financial risk is low can management focus on mitigating business risks ihave always maintained that the notion of an optimal capital structure that requires companies to have leverage which is espoused by corporate finance theorists is not just wrong but dangerous a strong balance sheet is not the one that maximizes debt to minimize the cost of capital but the one that minimizes debt to maximize the safety of capital fortunately none of the owners of nalanda portfolio companies studied finance at fancy business schools ignoring m a junkies nothing happens in well oiled businesses on a day to day basis sorry a lot happens but it s largely mundane repetitive uninter esting dull and monotonous and this is the way it should be imagine the day to day operations of a business that sells bars of bath soap here is a typical day or week or month or year the factory manufactures bars of soap in the thousands and performs quality control checks to reject defects the packing department stacks the bars in boxes logistics ensures timely shipping at pre agreed costs warehouses stock the boxes in assigned positions last mile delivery delivers the bars on time and the finance depart ment records the payments received from the retailers no news no excitement what would be the best way for such a business or any business for that matter to get reported on in the wall street journal or the financial times m a in industry parlance mergers and acquisitions for some reason the media love the news of one business merging with or acquiring another one the investment bankers and financiers who make fat fees love them even more following such an announcement the ceo is typically invited to a cnbc interview during which they will extol the virtues of strategic fit synergies culture fit and other boilerplate platitudes uttered in every single m a they are almost always wrong most mergers and acquisitions fail here are the statements made by the ceos of aol and time warner when they announced their 350 billion merger on january 10 2000 stephen case the cofounder of aol proudly proclaimed this is a historic moment when new media has truly come of age not to be left behind gerald levin the ceo of time warner gushed philosophically that the internet had begun to create unprecedented and instantaneous access to every form of media and to unleash immense possibilities for economic growth human understanding and creative expression the result of this bromance the largest failed merger in the history of the corporate world 23 within two years aol took a write off of 99 billion on the deal yes billion with a b the market value of aol went from 226 billion in 2000 to 20 billion in 2002 in june 2015 it was acquired for a mere 4 4 billion by verizon go ahead and blame me for cherry picking guilty as charged but think about this aol and time warner were undisputed leaders in their industries they had highly regarded ceos their boards were exemplary their financial position was rock solid they employed supremely talented and motivated staff they had access to the best consultants and yet they failed miserably if they couldn t hack it what chance do most companies have the sad fact is the disastrous aol time warner saga plays out thou sands of times every year and an even sadder fact is that everyone knows about it there is a jot of literature available on the high failure rate of m a 24 a harvard business review article by clayton chris tensen and others titled the big idea the new m a playbook claims that 70 to 90 percent of mergers and acquisitions fail a kpmg study claims that 83 percent of merger deals did not create value a cornell university research article declares that an abundance of empirical research has examined the performance of acquirers across all industries and in general has failed to find consistent evidence of improvements in value after the acquisition an organizational dynamics research article by toby j tetenbaum asserts that 60 to 80 percent of all mergers are financial failures and a study by great prairie group cites studies from mckinsey harvard business school bain and the wharton school to state that the m a failure rate is over 70 percent in all these studies the reasons for failure include culture mismatch overpayment misevaluation of the opportunity external factors and in tegration problems among many others but they don t point out the single biggest reason we detest m a opportunity cost let s visit the german giant bayer to un derstand this reason dr marijn dekkers the chair of bayer ag had every reason to be proud in 2015 during his five years as chair this life sci ences company has grown revenue from 35 billion to 46 billion and its eps had more than tripled from 1 6 per share to 5 per share it continued its reign as the largest company on the german stock exchange with a market value of about 140 billion the 2015 annual report was replete with good news without being boastful dr dekker s excellent commentary made it evident that the company was one of the world s leading life sciences businesses the only piece of bad news was tucked away on page seven of the report dr dekkers wrote this is my last chairman s let ter to you as ceo of bayer how bad was dr dekker s revelation for bayer in 2020 its sales had fallen to 41 billion from 46 billion in 2015 from being a highly profitable business with a return on equity of 18 percent in 2015 it declared a net loss of 10 billion and its divi dend per share was 20 percent lower than in 2015 oh and by june 2021 less than six years after the glorious year of 2015 bayer s market value had declined by 65 percent to 50 billion what happened within ten days of dr dekker s departure bayer made a bid to acquire monsanto the u s agrochemical giant bayer ended up paying 63 billion for the acquisition which was more than bayer s market value in june 2021 if you read reports on the reasons for this disaster most will focus on bayer losing multiple lawsuits and incurring billions in damages because plaintiffs were able to convince the u s courts that monsanto s roundup weed killer causes cancer the reports aren t wrong but they missed the real value destroyer invisible in the bayer monsanto transaction and the reason we abhor al most all m a opportunity cost stated simply most analyses of m a failure focus on the bad things that happened rather than on the good things that didn t happen let s see what bayer may have missed doing by making a gargantuan acquisition these actions and inactions fall into three categories divestiture of attractive businesses reduced focus on existing businesses and missed opportunities after acquiring monsanto bayer had to divest many of its core businesses for two reasons first regulators forced them to do so because both companies were large players in the agrochemical sector second bayer had to pay down the huge debt they had incurred to finance the deal bayer s net debt had gone up ten times from 3 6 billion in 2017 to 36 billion in 2018 in 2017 bayer divested large parts of its seed and herbicide businesses for 6 billion in 2018 it sold its 60 percent stake in a highly lucrative business called currenta for 1 billion and sold the consumer brands coppertone and dr scholl s in 2020 bayer exited its leading and highly profitable animal health business for 7 billion if we add up the sale value of these divestitures that s at least 15 billion or about 30 percent of bayer s market value in mid 2021 these businesses had been owned and run by bayer for decades and so it is possible that the market was assigning a much higher value than 15 billion to them when they were inside bayer the future benefit from these attractive businesses was lost forever the geese laying golden eggs were slaughtered to buy a hen that refused to lay any eggs the second major opportunity cost is a reduced focus on existing businesses because of the distraction of a bad acquisition you can see this in bayer s annual reports of 2018 2019 and 2020 in which a lot of ink was expended on justifying the acquisition and on steps being taken to mitigate the disaster as usual numbers tell a better story as i will explain next bayer has three business divisions pharmaceuticals consumer health and crop science from 2016 to 2020 the sales of its pharma division stayed flat at around 16 billion to 17 billion although 2020 was the year of covid most global pharma companies did not experience a decline in sales could this stagnation have been due to the acquisition distraction from 2010 to 2015 pharma sales had more than doubled from 6 6 billion to 13 7 billion from 2015 to 2020 rather than assuming a dou bling of sales let s consider a modest 50 percent increase in a scenario in which management was not being compelled to fight fires this would have led to pharma sales of 21 billion the actual number was 17 billion i think it s fair to assume that bayer s pharma division lost sales of 4 billion as a result of the monsanto acquisition the market value of global pharma companies is about three to five times sales let s be conservative and take a 2 5 times multiple this is an opportunity cost of at least 10 billion the operating income of bayer s consumer health division declined from 1 2 billion in 2015 to 0 8 billion in 2019 let s ignore 2020 when many consumer businesses were affected by covid most global consumer businesses grew their operating income during this period similarly the operating income of bayer s crop science division fell from 2 1 billion to 1 9 billion during this period while its competitors did much better and remember that monsanto s acquisition is counted in the crop science division and so despite the 63 billion acquisition the operating income of the division fell from 2015 to 2019 in 2015 the operating income of the consumer health and crop science divisions added up to a little more than half the consolidated operating income of bayer thus we can conservatively assume that at least a third of bayer s value in 2015 was derived from these two divisions since bayer s value was 140 billion in 2015 we can assign a value of at least 45 billion to 50 billion to these divisions for 2015 which was the total value of bayer in june 2021 what was the opportunity cost of the under performance of these two divisions if the top management had not been consumed by monsanto s unending troubles and if they had enhanced their 2015 value by 30 to 50 percent over the next five years we see a likely missed gain of around 15 billion to 25 billion let s now come to the third and probably the largest opportunity cost missed opportunities for bayer this was not making a covid 19 vaccine imagine the end of 2019 at bayer the company s leverage has multiplied more than nine times since 2017 to 34 billion the u s litigation is getting uglier and more costly by the month the return on capital is down to less than 4 percent from the high teens a few years earlier and the investors are as angry as hell with the stock price falling to half its peak also a few years earlier and then covid strikes in early 2020 do you think the senior management assembled around the table at corporate head quarters and said let s bet billions on developing a vaccine that we do not even know is possible would the bayer management have been willing to take a bet on an uncertain outcome given their dire operating and financial condition we will never know for sure and your guess is as good as mine but a shot in the dark for an uncertain payoff by this long suffering company unlikely bayer s 2020 annual report mentions that they signed an agreement with a biotech company to develop and manufacture a covid 19 vaccine that would be launched in 2022 meanwhile four competitors of bayer astrazeneca johnson johnson mod erna and pfizer had administered about five billion doses by july 2021 the covid 19 vaccine contributes to almost all of moderna s revenues and profits and so moderna is a good candidate to use to assess the notional loss for bayer from december 2019 before the pandemic hit until july 2021 moderna added about 120 billion 100 billion to its market value if we assume that the probability of bayer s success would have been 50 to 75 percent after all it was one of the global leaders bayer has foregone 50 billion to 75 billion in value creation owing to its inability or was it its unwillingness to develop a vaccine if we add up all these numbers the opportunity cost of monsanto s acquisition is probably in the range of 90 billion to 100 billion in other words instead of about 50 billion in june 2021 bayer could have been valued at 140 billion to 150 billion how do we know this is not a massive overstatement because bayer s value in 2015 was 140 billion if anything this opportunity cost calculation is a significant understatement because it assumes almost no additional value creation since 2015 while every other major pharmaceutical consumer and agrochemical business has added significant value since 2015 i don t know anything about bayer s management but presumably they are world class given their outsized success before 2016 if that s the case how did they get lulled into making such an acquisition because like most acquirers across the world they genuinely believed that this time it s different managers especially high performing ones and their advisers have a sense of invincibility and arrogance when evaluating a target they firmly believe that they will buck the trend the corporate world has wit nessed for a century most of them don t realize their folly until it s too late ifa business is a serial acquirer we stay away we know we can t price the risk if we had been evaluating bayer as a new in vestment in 2016 we would have passed until we were convinced that management would not repeat its mistakes some of our portfolio companies do occasionally make acquisitions our counsel to them is to be deeply skeptical of the potential value creation in all cases i will admit that the success rate of our advice has not been very high fortunately none of our companies is addicted to m a and the ones that do make acquisitions have never bet the company i am convinced that the cost of distraction even if it was a small one has not been worth the effort if any of them start becoming serial acquirers we will promptly press the exit button not predicting where the puck will be what do mid nineteenth century railways and late twentieth century dot coms have in common railways transformed the united kingdom in the early nineteenth century 5 the first passenger railway between liverpool and manchester was authorized by parliament in 1826 and opened in 1830 railways allowed people to travel farther at a much lower cost and in less time than the alternatives they also spurred the growth of cities by enabling cheaper and faster transport of people and building materials many entrepreneurs jumped into the fray and by 1844 had opened more than 2 200 miles of railroad line the stock market loved these companies which promised growth forever between 1843 and 1850 442 railway com panies made a public offering of shares between january 1 1843 and august 9 1845 the index of railway stock prices doubled but the bubble burst as they inevitably do the railway index fell over 67 percent from 1845 to 1850 many companies collapsed owing to incompetence poor financial planning or fraud not unlike the railway mania of the 1840s with the arrival of the internet in the mid 1990s for the masses venture capi talists and public markets funded hundreds of companies in the rapidly changing landscape this was called the dot com boom 2s the nasdaq index of technology stocks jumped five fold between 1995 and 2000 for the first time in recent capital market his tory losing money seemed to be the key to success in october 1999 just six months before the bubble burst the market value of 199 internet stocks tracked by mary meeker morgan stanley s internet analyst was 450 billion all these businesses were essen tially start ups they had been created in the previous two to five years more remarkably their combined revenue was only 21 billion and their cumulative loss was a staggering 6 2 billion when discussing the initial public offering ipo of priceline com a venture capitalist at benchmark admitted we re in an environment where the company doesn t have to be successful for us to make money the year 2000 marked the end of this insanity by the year 2005 listed silicon valley companies had lost two thirds of their value from market peak this was equivalent to a staggering 2 trillion loss of shareholder wealth venture capital funding collapsed from about 105 billion in 2000 to 21 billion in 2004 nasdaq had reached its peak in march 2000 it took more than fif teen years for it to regain this level you can now guess the answer to the question i raised at the beginning of this section the common thread that binds eighteenth century railways and twentieth century dot coms is the potential for enormous value destruction wrought by a fast changing industry there are many similar examples in india of various new and upcoming industries that catch the fancy of investors when nalanda was established in 2007 the infrastructure boom was at its peak and some of the leading companies were valued at billions of dollars the indian government had finally begun focusing on building roads airports power plants and ports and private and public equity investors seemed to have an unlimited appetite for these companies but the infrastructure business in india was in a fledgling state in the late 2000s the regulations were nascent and untested and the basis of long term success was unclear the ensuing value destruction assumed epic proportions two of the affected infrastructure businesses were reliance power and jaiprakash power ventures whose market values were 29 billion and 23 billion respectively in early 2008 each was valued at less than 700 million at the end of 2021 a collapse of more than 97 percent the indian public equity market has witnessed similar booms and busts across other rapidly evolving industries like retail real estate education and microfinance private equity has gone wild for nonbank finance companies nbfcs new age e com merce businesses like food and grocery delivery and software as a service and digital education companies to name just a few some companies in industries that change fast ultimately do end up creating a lot of value but very few companies the only ones that have created truly significant value from the dot com era are amazon and google facebook was founded in 2004 if you want to be charitable you could add ebay and priceline now called booking holdings but that s it just step back and think about this for a moment only a handful of businesses from the 1995 2000 bubble have prospered to give you a sense of the scale of destruction 546 ipos successfully raised 69 billion in 1999 alone what would have been the probability of finding the next winner the path to creating wealth in rapidly evolving industries is treacherous and we refuse to walk on it many investors are slaves to the famous quote of the hockey legend wayne gretzky i skate to where the puck is going to be not where it has been 22 iam not one of them i am just not that smart in fast changing industries i have no idea who will win when or how and to draw the parallel with hockey since i don t know where the puck is going to be i refuse to play we at nalanda love stable predictable boring industries give us electric fans over electric vehicles boilers over biotech sanitaryware over semiconductors and enzymes over e commerce we like industries in which the winners and losers have been largely sorted out and the rules of the game are apparent to everyone for everything else thanks but no thanks not aligning with unaligned owners as an outside and passive owner we at nalanda want the company owner to align their interest with the shareholders we have only one objective as a shareholder of any business long term value creation the company must do this in an ethical sustainable manner that is fair to all stakeholders including employees vendors suppliers and customers but as strange as it may sound not every owner has the same objective there are broadly three categories of owners that we avoid to mitigate our typei risk first government owned businesses unlike the western world india has a large number of publicly traded government owned companies they are almost always cheap and for a value investor they have been unhappy hunting grounds for as long as i can remember i say unhappy because most of these cheap businesses almost always stay cheap some fund managers may have figured out a way to invest successfully in government owned businesses but we will not invest in a government owned enterprise at any price the government wants to achieve multiple objectives with their businesses some of which may have noth ing to do with enhancing value and profits for example the indian state and federal governments regularly resort to farm loan waivers 22 this involves forgiving the loans of farmers who have borrowed from government owned banks the loan waiver trend started in 1990 the first waiver was for 1 4 billion and continues today almost every state and federal government has gotten on the bandwagon over the past three decades this may suit the governments and maybe even the farmers i say maybe because farmers may not find it easy to bor row the next time they go to the bank but it may be destructive for the minority shareholder it is not unusual for the indian government to reward a senior bureaucrat by giving them a senior position at a government owned business again this may suit the bureaucrat but not a shareholder we have nothing against bureaucrats but the skill re quired to run a company successfully in a competitive environment is not the same as that needed to manage a district or devise a sound social policy for a state some businesses especially the public sector oil companies occasionally become cash rich and the government then uses them as a piggy bank to manage their fiscal deficit it suits the government but how can this be beneficial for a shareholder it is not that the government objectives are wrong they make sense in the light of the multiple constituen cies whose needs they are trying to meet their objectives are just different from ours the second category of owners we avoid religiously is the listed subsidiaries of global giants a few decades ago the indian government forced all indian subsidiaries of global multinational companies mncs to list in the domestic market global mncs like cummins nestlé procter gamble p g siemens unilever and many others have locally listed subsidiaries some are fairly large by indian standards for example the unilever subsidiary in india hindustan unilever is valued at about 70 billion at first glance it may appear that these mncs should be aligned with the indian minority shareholder but there have been many instances when they weren t a few decades ago a large global mnc with a listed company in india set up a separate fully owned subsidiary this makes no logical sense because the global giant has only one listing in its home market for a minority shareholder of the listed indian business this was a stab in the back because the fully owned subsidiary now does a significant amount of business so why would the parent company do this isn t it interested in value creation yes it is but it is more inter ested in the value creation of the parent not the indian listed child by creating a separate fully owned business the global mnc has ensured that value accrues to the shareholders in its home market at the cost of the indian minority shareholder it gets worse my friends who have worked for many years in this mnc have told me that its best managers are sent to the privately held busi ness not the listed company what can a minority shareholder do absolutely nothing not all mncs resort to such shenanigans but enough do even if an mnc has behaved well in the past there is no reason it wouldn t change its mind in the future there is a structural problem with an arrangement in which a parent also has a listed sub sidiary we have better things to do than to participate in this inherent conflict last we are not fans of the indian conglomerates the best known is the tata group which jamsetji tata established in 1868 22 the group had twenty nine listed businesses with combined revenues of 128 billion and a market value of 311 billion as of march 2022 they manufacture steel gold jewelry air conditioners tea and cars oh and they also own and operate five star luxury hotels from mumbai to new york there are many others like adani aditya birla l t mahindra and rp sanjiv goenka all typically run a gamut of unrelated businesses across a wide range of industries we believe that value creation is possible only through sustained focus however while focus is necessary it does not guar antee success in a competitive world most focused businesses aren t successful so how does one achieve excellence in multiple entities across entirely different industries it s hard but not impossible one of the world s leading technology services businesses is a tata group company called tcs whose market value of around 150 billion was about 25 percent more than that of ibm in mid 2022 you may have seen its name splashed across manhattan in november in the years it sponsored the new york city marathon tcs is the exception that proves the rule maybe the indian conglomerates will succeed in creating great businesses across their entire portfolios one day but we are unwilling to wait for that glorious future but you would have missed tesla yup we would have we eschew a very long list of risks this is the core element of our investment strategy we don t invest in businesses run by crooks we detest turnarounds we stay as far away from leverage as possible we refuse to engage with m a addicts we can t fig ure out fast changing industries and we don t align ourselves with unaligned owners are there any businesses left for us to invest in in india not many at nalanda our shortlist comprises seventy five to eighty companies out of a universe of about eight hun dred with a market value of more than 100 million except for filial love nothing in life comes free nalanda s approach has a trade off that many of you may find unacceptable imagine it s late 2017 and you are impressed with all the media coverage of tesla the product seems like a winner based on its vast fan following the ceo looks as impressive as the car he makes but in 2017 tesla had a net debt of about 7 billion and had suffered an operating loss of 1 6 billion the company was also burning cash very fast it had consumed 4 1 billion during the year the traditional car businesses like bmw ford gm and toyota had not yet entered the electric vehicle fray but they had announced big plans we abhor debt in general but debt in a loss making company with negative free cash flow in a fast changing industry one can get fired at nalanda for proposing an investment in a business like this if you had listened to what we had to say about the business you would not have invested your opportunity loss ten times your money over the next three years when we started nalanda in 2007 there was a lot of buzz around a company called eicher motors led by a young dynamic guy called siddhartha lal lal had inherited a hodgepodge of poor quality businesses from his father in 2004 they manufactured motorcycles footwear garments tractors trucks auto components and a few other products and none was an industry leader in aremarkably bold strategic move lal decided to divest thirteen of the fifteen businesses to focus on just two products trucks and motorcycles 22 almost every analyst was gung ho about the future of eicher they were all taken in by its dynamic leader who was aggres sively culling businesses something that indian firms rarely did however in 2007 this was a turnaround story with no empirical evidence of success the company s biggest hit the enfield classic motorcycle was launched only in 2010 we decided not to invest in the business by the 2010s the company s motorcycles had taken on cult status in the indian consumer s mind sales exploded from just 52 000 units in 2009 to 822 000 units in 2019 a sixteen fold growth if you had listened to what we had to say about the business you would not have invested your opportunity loss seventy times your money from 2007 until 2021 tesla and eicher motors are the kinds of type ii error we will inevitably commit because we reject highly indebted busi nesses rapidly evolving industry landscapes and turnarounds but we will not change our approach for every tesla and eicher hundreds of unproven business models and turnaround stories are unceremoniously consigned to the dustbin of history we believe our success is contingent upon our being comfortable with missing out on teslas and eichers because on average avoiding type i errors works wonders over the long term it has done so for us 2k a bumblebee is a hairy insect that barely measures an inch in length the species there are about three hundred of them have been around for about thirty million years they are preyed upon by crab spiders and birds their survival strategy was beautifully demonstrated in an experiment conducted by dr tom ings and professor lars chittka of queen mary university of london whose work was published in science daily in 2008 the scientists created a garden of artificial flowers that also contained some robotic crab spiders they hid some spiders and made others visible whenever a bumblebee landed on a flower with a crab spider the spider captured the bumblebee between its foam pincers within a few seconds the robotic spider released the bee the team found that the bumblebees soon started committing more type ii errors they started avoiding flowers even where there were no spiders thereby reducing their foraging efficiency in the wild this instinct to avoid danger at the cost of going hungry must have played a significant role in the tremen dous success of the species over millions of years if the bumblebee can why can t we chapter summary evolutionary theory has taught me that the first and probably most important step in reimagining investing is to learn how not to invest 1 living things prioritize survival over everything else in the animal world this applies to prey and predator plants give up on opportunities to grow by redirecting resources when survival is at stake 2 millions of years of evolution have programmed the organic world to minimize errors of commission in favor of errors of omission 3 buffett s two rules of investing never lose money and don t forget to never lose money are essentially a diktat for eliminat ing significant risks 4 at nalanda we want to be permanent owners of high quality businesses hence we want to minimize risk before maximiz ing returns 5 just like the living world we forgo potentially juicy opportunities if the risk of losing our capital is high 6 we do this by avoiding crooks turnarounds high debt serial acquirers fast changing industries and unaligned owners i believe we can be better investors only if we are better rejectors 7 one downside of this approach is that we occasionally walk away from a potentially attractive investment we are willing to live with this downside section ii buy high quality at a fair price his section describes and using evolutionary theory justifies our buying philosophy at nalanda for many investors identifying the right business to buy at the right time is almost all there is to investing switch on cnbc open a finan cial newspaper or read a blog and you will witness a lot of time spent and ink spilled on companies to buy this is un fortunate as we have already seen in section i not buying is an equally if not more important skill there is also a profound conundrum about the buying strategy advocated by most fund managers everyone seems to spout the exact same philosophy as this section s topic buy high quality at a fair price i challenge you to find me a fund manager who professes to buy poor quality businesses at high prices then why does the performance of professional investors vary so widely one reason not the only one but a crucial one is that our community has wildly different opinions on the meaning of high quality and fair in this section with many evolutionary theory elements as a backdrop i will clarify the meaning of these words as they apply to nalanda i will discuss what we buy in chapters 2 to 4 and how we buy in chapters 5 to 7 let s begin in siberia chapter 2 the siberian solution hairless dogs have imperfect teeth long haired and coarse haired animals are apt to have as is asserted long or many horns pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes pigeons with short beaks have small feet and those with long beaks large feet hence if man goes on selecting and thus augmenting any peculiarity he will almost certainly unconsciously modify other parts of the structure owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation of growth charles darwin on the origin of species chapter 1 variation under domestication an economic franchise arises from a product or service that 1 is needed or desired 2 is thought by its customers to have no close substi tute and 3 is not subject to price regulation the existence of all three conditions will be demonstrated by a company s ability to regularly price its product or service aggressively and thereby to earn high rates of return on capital moreover franchises can tolerate mismanage ment inept managers may diminish a franchise s profitability but they cannot inflict mortal damage warren buffett annual letter to shareholders 1991 yudmila trut was dumbfounded it had all started almost exactly five years ago when she had met dmitri belyaev the famous director of the insti tute when she heard about dmitri s project from her professor she enthusiastically volunteered dmitri s candor passion and intellect immediately enamored her and surprisingly in this male dominated field in which women were treated as second class citizens he had talked to her as a peer though he was a couple decades older and a renowned personality in the field dmitri was trying to enlist a graduate student for a secret project but lyudmila had not yet even finished her undergraduate studies he must have seen something unique in the young and talented student to recruit her after just one meeting she remem bered his warnings about the physical hardship the long hours and most importantly the uncertain fate of her budding scientific career dmitri s project carried a lot of risk and could come to naught and even if the project succeeded they could not talk about it openly because scientists had been killed for less including dmitri s brother she was grateful to dmitri for not sugarcoating the work but it turned out to be far more demanding than she had imag ined she was living in the middle of siberia and although she had grown up in moscow she had not yet become accustomed to the bone chilling cold worse the project required her to travel far across the siberian wilderness on cold dark and dreary trains and she desperately missed her fast growing toddler marina there were no phones so she could not even hear her child s voice it had been five years of unrelenting hard work and sacrifice and she had precious little to show dmitri in april 1963 as she approached one of the cages she was stopped in her tracks she had never seen anything like this be fore nor had any other human being was she really witnessing this or was it an illusion had her patience and diligence paid off she was a scientist and knew that she could not get carried away by emotion but she could not contain the feeling when it welled up pure joy unbelievably inconceivably ember was wagging his tail oh where do i begin you have decided to become an investor in listed companies you value your intellect and discipline and it seems that many of your friends and cousins are successful investors most of them are lying but that s another story if they can do it why can t you you choose to ignore buffett s advice about investing in index funds and launch headlong into analyzing businesses you have read the first chapter of this book and although you are mildly peeved at the author s degree of risk aversion you decide that maybe he has a point thank you heeding his advice you have done your best to reject the many categories of companies that may increase your blood pressure at a later date having shot down hundreds of businesses you are now excited about selecting high quality businesses you open your lap top launch the application or a website with data on companies and then what what do you do for every company you see a gazillion pieces of information on tap revenue growth profit growth debt level margin profile stock price movement analysts views bond ratings twitter commentary shareholder information top management ré sumeés conference call transcripts annual reports quarterly filings media coverage competitor profiles shares bought or sold by senior management receivable and inventory levels ceo statements reddit threads hedge fund ownership and so much more and all this is just at the company level you have listened to so called experts on tv many of whom seem to believe that one must also consider macro factors when making a buy decision you start wallowing in the data on historical gdp growth projected gdp growth inflation inflationary expectations interest rates government deficit employment levels commodity price movement projected demographics money supply political and regulatory forces and many such readily available factors supposedly crucial for your buy decision should you study all of them or only some of them how do you start short listing the businesses that you want to explore further what macro factors if any should you consider in short where do you begin one option would be to analyze each listed business after you have cast aside the high risk ones the problem is that you do not have unlimited time the number of companies may be in the hundreds and you may need to spend months if not years to go through the entire list one alternative would be to use a two step process that we use at nalanda in the first step we use one selection criterion that filters out low quality or average quality businesses and yields a preliminary list of high quality companies in the second step we do more work on this preliminary list to further whittle it down to a final list our investable universe is around 800 indian businesses with a market value of more than 150 million of these we have rejected close to 350 companies to minimize the risks outlined in the previous chapter about 450 businesses remain we then apply a single filter to cut down this list to about 150 firms let me call this single filter f remember that f simply gives us the preliminary list on which we need to work further to reject or choose businesses after doing this work our final list has only about 75 to 80 businesses f gave us an excellent head start and it continues to do so because we don t spend any time analyzing a business unless f has cleared it this chapter is about the f filter what it is and why what in your opinion is f to do its job it needs to satisfy three criteria first it should be easily measurable second it should remove most if not all low quality businesses last it should select most if not all high quality businesses let s start with some guesses a first plausible assumption would be a great management team great businesses and outstanding management teams seem like tautologies finding an excellent set of leaders may automatically lead us to a high quality business even if it does not it looks like a good starting point for our filter an exceptional management team would ensure revenue and profit growth ahead of the competition a balance sheet that is not risky a sustainable competitive advantage and products or services that customers love easy right not so fast how is an investor supposed to find a great management team if you are a small investor the best you can do is read their interviews listen to their conference call recordings check out their twitter feeds watch some of their interviews on youtube and peruse their annual reports if you are a large or prominent investor you might even be able to meet the senior leaders how ever in my experience as an investor none of these activities helps an investor calibrate the quality of amanagement team here is a stark example if you have time i suggest watching the youtube video of the january 2000 presentation by the president of enron jeffrey skilling and his senior management on the launch of enron broadband 21 dare you not to be impressed the guys are poised confident and at least to my eyes extremely competent it is hard to find fault with their strategy or vision and their execution plan for broadband services seems spot on however in less than two years after this impressive presentation enron went bankrupt and in 2006 skilling was sent to prison for perpetrating a massive fraud 3 except for a few short sellers no professional analysts or investors could have guessed what was going on at enron even though the management was quite open to the media and regularly gave interviews i know what you are thinking am i building my entire case on an outlier like enron let s look at it another way i assume you have read the interviews of many ceos or company presidents did any mention that they don t care for the customer that they have stopped innovating or that they hire people who have been rejected by other companies have you ever heard a com pany leader disparage their products or services or admit that their competition is doing a better job or that they are sick and tired of company politics you will rarely if ever learn anything insightful from what the management says they always say what they have been taught to say which at best is useless and at worst is harmful because as with enron their words are persuasive in my experience when someone says this is a great management team what they are actually saying is these guys talk so well the great management team filter thus fails the first criterion of measurability being easily measurable i know that many professional investors will disagree with me many people in the fund management world pride them selves on their purported ability to separate the wheat from the chaff after a series of management meetings some of them may have this rare skill but most are either deluded or lying and if there is someone out there who can assess a company s quality by meeting management we can applaud them from the sidelines without falling into the trap ourselves what about other guesses for choosing a single company trait that could point to its overall quality could it be revenue growth markets seem to love companies growing at a fast pace the problem with a revenue growth measure is this how do we know what went into achieving this growth in the previous chapter i discussed the dot com bust in the context of fast changing industries this period is also relevant when assessing high growth businesses in the late 1990s most internet businesses were growing fast but they were achieving this gravity defying feat by spending millions of dollars of cash far in excess of their revenues predictably and unfortunately growth did not turn out to be the blessing investors had hoped it would be they ignored the cost of growth and suffered for it al most all the dot coms went belly up eventually 4 by the end of 2005 the loss of market value of these newfangled businesses was almost 2 trillion more recently the spectacular failure of wework provides a lesson in funding hyper growth by burning cash 5 as many of you may already know softbank funded wework became one of the largest coworking space companies on the planet and was once valued at 47 billion in late 2021 its market value had fallen to about 5 billion the company grew its revenues from 415 million in 2016 to 3 5 billion in 2019 an eight fold jump over just three years also in 2019 iwg the old world coworking giant had revenue of 2 7 billion a growth of only 28 percent since 2016 wework was consuming cash as if it had a side business running a printing press for dollars in the third quarter of 2019 alone the company declared a loss of 1 25 billion it had to pull its ipo in the fourth quarter many high growth companies don t burn equity for growth but rely on debt instead which is even worse because debt hold ers need their money back with great regularity unlike equity investors do you remember the fast growing lehman brothers and bear stearns lehman grew its revenue by 36 percent annually from 17 billion in 2003 to 59 billion in 2007 this incremental revenue of about 40 billion was funded by an incremental debt of almost 90 billion similarly bear stearns grew its revenue seven fold from 2003 to 2007 2 its incremental revenue of 3 5 billion during this period was primarily funded by an additional debt of 42 billion when the financial crisis hit in 2008 these highly leveraged entities which had contributed to the problen had nowhere to hide they both collapsed that year ialso have a personal reason for not wanting revenue growth to be the primary selection criterion in my experience high growth businesses can hide myriad problems ranging from issues of product or service quality employee culture and accounting toa bloated balance sheet according to a study conducted by the kauffman foundation and inc magazine five to eight years after the magazine had identified five thousand businesses as fastest growing two thirds of those had shut down downsized or been sold disadvantageously i hope you will agree that while high growth is easy to measure it stumbles on our second filtering cri terion removing most if not all low quality businesses i know i know you will counter me with just one word apple this fantastic business grew its revenue thirty three fold from 2004 to 2020 at an annualized growth of 25 percent but for every apple there are hundreds if not thousands of lemons okay let s recap we want to use a single filter f to select businesses for further analysis this should hopefully save us a lot of time and effort we wondered if we could use quality management teams or fast growth as our starting point we rejected both as good candidates for f because it is tough to assess the former and the latter can end up causing heartburn a third guess for a criterion for short listing businesses for further analysis could be margins is a high margin business a high quality business many seem to think so margins can mean many things gross margin sales minus cost of goods sold divided by sales ebitda margin earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization divided by sales or ebit margin earnings before interest and tax divided by sales which of these if any should we choose for f let s start with gross margin which measures the direct cost of producing the product or service being sold accountants call this the cost of goods sold if a bar of bath soap retails for 1 and costs 30 cents to make then the gross margin is 70 percent does a high gross margin tell us anything about the quality of the business not really several internet businesses boasted a gross mar gin of more than 90 percent in the dot com era but almost all experienced huge losses because of their marketing spends what about ebitda margin or ebit margin also called operating margin measuring ebit margin would be more sensible because it accounts for depreciation which is a real cost of doing business but just because it is a better measure does not mean it is a good measure take this example of two real world businesses business c has had an operating margin of about 3 percent over the past fifteen years business t has delivered an operating margin of 19 percent over the same period would you reject business c and select business t because t is better than c if you did so you would have spurned costco one of america s best run businesses business t is tiffany co a reasonably well run business but not as well run as costco what makes costco at a margin of 3 per cent a better company than tiffany at 19 percent 2 i will get to that shortly suffice it to say that using margins as a starting point to narrow our list of companies may lead us astray it fails our second and third criteria removing most if not all low quality businesses and selecting high quality businesses we haven t yet considered macro factors for building the short list but which single piece of macro data should we consider for short listing individual businesses for example if experts believe that inflation will rise should we short list only con sumer goods businesses able to pass on the increased cost to their customers if we do so should we then completely revise the list if the inflation expectations get reversed within six months i don t know how to account for macro factors for short listing high quality businesses i am not suggesting that it is the wrong thing to do just that i don t know how it can be done and so we avoid considering any macro factor as our preliminary filter f what about accounting for macro factors when making our final list more on that later the evolutionary cascade of a single selection criterion meanwhile we seem to be stuck what could f be maybe lyudmila and her tail wagging ember can help us but before we seek guidance from them let s briefly visit the russia of the 1920s and 30s the brutal communist regime under joseph stalin was forcing individual farmers to give up their land and consolidate their holdings under kolkhozy or col lective farms 12 the central planners of the communist party had envisaged a dramatic increase in agriculture production and productivity arising from scale economies and improved control of output by the state they expected to be able to feed the rising urban population and increase exports the opposite happened the farmers strongly resisted giving up their ancestral land and property in fact many chose to destroy their crops and slaughter their animals instead of giving in to collectivization stalin sent millions of people to prison camps and millions more died of starvation as famine set in owing to the reduction in agriculture production in the middle of this disaster trofim lysenko an agriculture scientist claimed that he had invented a new technique to significantly increase agriculture production this new technique envisaged that a plant s acquired characteristics could be in herited this was in stark contrast to mendelian genetics and darwinism which had demonstrated by this time experimentally that genes were the unit of inheritance lysenko however promised an agricultural revolution with his unscientific techniques and got the attention of stalin who desperately needed a russian hero to solve his food crisis over time as lysenko became more powerful he declared genetics a pseudoscience and practicing geneticists were either executed or sent to labor camps in this environment the authorities fired the leading geneticist dmitri belyaev from his job at the department of fur animal breeding at the central research laboratory belyaev s elder brother who was studying the genetics of silkworms was executed at lysenko s behest in 1937 dmitri however kept studying genetics in secret in 1959 with nikita khrushchev s ascension to power he became the director of the institute of cytology and genetics of the russian academy of sciences in novosibirsk siberia dmitri held this post for twenty six years until his death in 1985 and during this time he conducted one of the most remarkable longest running ex periments in the history of biology 1 the investigation continues today dmitri belyaev wanted to answer two questions 1 how had the domestication of animals e g dogs pigs goats and cows started and 2 why did most domestic animals have similar characteristics including floppy ears curly tails a piebald coloration patches of black and white and babyish faces he believed that the domestication of animals resulted from underlying heritable genetic changes that had occurred during the course of selection over millennia the big unanswered question was what was being selected natural and artificial selection can occur only if something is selected for generation after generation for example whereas both cheetahs and lions are ferocious predators among many other factors cheetahs have been selected for speed and lions for their size and strength in other words a slow cheetah is unlikely to leave any offspring but a big strong lion is likely to leave many dmitri hypothesized that the key factor selected when our ancestors domesticated wild animals was tameness thus the unit of selection was not related to an animal s physical attributes but to its behavior this was an audacious guess since most scientists then assumed that physical morphology was the unit of selection how could dmitri test his bold theory only by going back to the time when animals first started becoming domesticated for dogs this would have meant experimenting on wild wolves but getting a supply of wolves would have been very hard in siberia so he chose the silver fox he designed a selective breeding experiment that focused only on tameness as the selection factor as described earlier he recruited lyudmila trut an undergraduate student at the prestigious moscow university to lead and manage the experiment in siberia lyudmila would forever change the field of behavioral genetics with her tenacity and creativity 12 lyudmila s first task was to select a location for breeding the foxes she chose a large commercial farm that sold fox fur called lesnoi more than 350 kilometers from novosibirsk where she and her family lived she began the experiment in the fall of 1960 with about a dozen foxes she also hired several women from nearby villages to be caretakers and experimenters here is how it worked the experimenters gave the foxes a series of tests from the time they were one month old to their sexual maturity at six to seven months when a fox pup was one month old the experimenter extended her hand to offer it food while trying to stroke it she tested the fox pup twice once in the cage and once while the pup was roaming freely with other pups in a larger enclosure she repeated this test monthly until the pup reached sexual maturity to ensure that the pup s reaction to these tests was based solely on genetic selection the pups were not trained and did not have any human contact except for their brief interactions with the experimenters the pups were caged with their mothers until they were about two months old and then with their litter mates at about three months of age they were put into their own cages when the pups were about seven months old the experimenters assigned them to one of three categories based on their tameness class iii foxes were unfriendly toward the handlers and either ran away from them or were aggressive class ii foxes behaved neutrally and displayed no emotional response toward the handlers class i foxes were the friendliest and seemed to want to engage with the handlers lyudmila and her team selected a few of the calmest class i foxes for mating and repeated the experiment with the next generation of pups by the third generation in 1962 lyudmila noticed that some of the tamer foxes had started mating a few days earlier than usual and were producing slightly larger litters than wild foxes otherwise there was no indication of any significant change in april 1963 as lyudmila approached the cages of the fourth generation of pups she saw a male pup called ember vigor ously wagging his tail this was precisely what a puppy would do but no one had ever witnessed a silver fox whether in a cage or the wild wag its tail at a human ember wagged his tail at other humans too no other pup of his generation did so but even a single fox radically altering its behavior to mimic a dog was significant news dmitri had told lyudmila in their first meeting that he wanted to make a dog out of a fox had the process begun in 1966 many of the sixth generation pups that ember had sired started wagging their tails at the handlers ember had not been an anomaly he was a trailblazer lyudmila had categorically demonstrated that tail wagging was genetically heritable by this time the researchers had to add another class of foxes called class ie the elites these foxes were extremely friendly were eager to establish human contact and like dogs whimpered to attract attention in the sixth generation about 1 8 percent of the pups were elites by the twentieth generation almost 35 percent had reached elite status after about thirty five generations more than 70 percent of the population had attained elite status this is a breakneck pace of evolution in less than forty years dmitri and lyudmila s experiment had essentially converted a population of wild foxes who avoided humans into dog like creatures that could be kept as pets in any of our homes these foxes were very docile competed for human attention and formed deep emotional bonds with their handlers it had become hard to distinguish their behavior from that of dogs lyudmila and her team had erased their wildness almost completely but don t raise your eyebrows in astonishment just yet i haven t even told you the most interesting result of the experiment the experimenters noticed that the eighth generation of these tamer foxes also started displaying some novel physical traits the first change was in coat color some of the foxes fur had a piebald pattern which is common among domesticated animals like sheep dogs horses pigs goats mice and guinea pigs a piebald pattern forms when two colors typically black and white form irregular patches on the animal s skin no wild foxes in the experiment were piebald but as their tameness increased over the generations they started showing this coloration further physical traits to appear were floppy ears and rolled tails again com mon among many domesticated species especially dogs in 1974 lyudmila decided to raise the experiment s stakes by living with the foxes in the same house to start she chose a friendly fox called pushinka one evening lyudmila was sitting on a bench outside her home with pushinka relaxing next to her as usual suddenly pushinka got up as if she had heard something and started barking it turned out to be the night guard and pushinka stopped her aggressive posturing and barking when she realized that the guard posed no imminent danger to lyudmila this guard dog like behavior rushing to protect a human from a potential threat had never been observed before by lyudmila in the early 1990s the team also started noticing that the skulls and jaws of the domesticated foxes had started diverging from those of their wild brethren the cranial height and width of the domesticated foxes skulls had shortened their snouts had become shorter and wider giving them a baby like appearance almost exactly mimicking the differences between a dog anda wolf let s consider this for a moment remember dmitri and his team were selecting for only one trait the willingness of foxes to be tamed they weren t interested in body size coat color skull shape ear stiffness or anything else the experimenters took great care to ensure selection based only on tameness but this single filter of a behavioral characteristic had triggered many physi cal changes in the animals how could this have happened there were no new mutations in the domesticated silver foxes but their gene expression had changed owing to the selection for tameness this is how a gene does not change but alters what it expresses it produces more or fewer chemicals like proteins or hormones for example when a dog owner stares lovingly into their canine s eyes oxytocin is released in the systems of both the dog and the owner creating a positive feedback loop in which the two enjoy each other s company more and more if the same owner encounters an unknown dog on the street no oxytocin is released although it s the same gene in question the gene expres sion is different in different situations scientists have demonstrated that gene expression needs to change only a little to havea significant impact on an animal s body and behavior as lyudmila and her team selected tamer foxes they unknowingly impacted the expression of a select set of genes this selection altered the amount and timing of release of certain neurochemicals and hormones that regulated the developmental and physical traits of the foxes for example the hormone melatonin is known to manipulate the timing of mating in many species the researchers found that the elite females released a lot more melatonin than their class ii and iii peers and were ready for mat ing a few days earlier than normal the hormonal change was so extreme that some females were ready to mate twice a year a phe nomenon never seen in the wild selecting for tameness had impacted the reproductive cycle of the species a gene called htr2c produced much higher levels of serotonin and dopamine in the elites than in wild foxes serotonin is a key hormone in shaping the early development of an animal and its increase is likely to have changed the physiology and behavior of the domesticated foxes the researchers also discovered that the tamed foxes had much lower levels of adrenaline than their wild cousins adrenaline reg ulates the production of melanin which determines the coloration of skin and fur the silver fox experiment also solved the centuries old puzzle of the numerous physical similarities among domesticated animals discussed earlier dmitri had rightly hypothesized that since mammals share similar hormonal and neurotransmitter regulatory systems selecting for tameness would unleash broadly similar developmental and physical changes in them as well dmitri and lyudmila s experiment now running for more than sixty years has demonstrated that evolution does not occur piecemeal the behavior and physiology of animals are intimately connected darwin with his acute powers of observation knew this his statement at the beginning of this chapter asserts that hairless dogs have imperfect teeth and pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes he predicted that if humans choose to select for one characteristic they will surely also cause transformations in other characteristics owing to what he called the mysterious laws of the correlation of growth dmitri and lyudmila had proven darwin right select one get many free as an investor would you not want to be in the position of selecting just one trait of a business but getting many high quality attributes for free as discussed earlier this single trait should satisfy three criteria it should be measurable reject most busi nesses of poor quality and select most high quality businesses most not necessarily all we have seen that some factors like high quality management revenue growth and margins do not serve the purpose well enough at nalanda here is what we begin with while short listing businesses historical return on capital employed roce the first word first historical i devote an entire chapter to this important and oft ignored word but for now i wanted to clarify that the roce number is what a business has delivered in the past we don t listen to stories about how roce will improve in the future we want to assess a company purely on its historically delivered roce now let s look at some definitions roce is simply the operating profit of the business as a percentage of total capital em ployed as defined earlier operating profit is earnings before interest and taxes or ebit why do we not use profit after tax pat instead remember we want to understand a business s operating performance and mixing it with financial measures like tax and interest will muddy the waters we do not ignore tax or interest charges in our overall evaluation of the business but for calculat ing roce we limit ourselves to operating performance what about total capital employed this typically comprises two factors net working capital and net fixed assets in the net working capital number we like to exclude excess cash i e cash minus debt if cash happens to be much greater than debt because extra cash is not an operating asset also high roce companies generate a lot of cash and incorporating cash into the capital employed number will unnecessarily reduce roce if you are uncomfortable with this you can include a portion of cash in capital employed for an acquisitive company we also include the capital invested in acquiring businesses but let s keep things simple for the moment thus roce for nonfinancial companies can be defined as follows ebit net working capital net fixed assets do you now see why using operating margin to filter businesses may not be the best approach margins do not tell us what we had to invest to get those margins the advantage of measuring roce is that it accounts for the quality of p l in the numera tor as well as the balance sheet in the denominator let s return to costco and tiffany i claimed that costco at an operating margin of 3 percent is a better business than tiffany at 19 percent if we limit our defi nition of better to the level of roce then i was right this is because costco s average roce from 2014 to 2019 pre pandemic was 22 percent compared to tiffany s 16 percent costco is deploying its capital much more effectively than tiffany and this more than compensates for costco s low margin let s take the example of just one important part of its capital employed inventory costco keeps about 31 days of inventory in its warehouses and retail stores guess the same number for tiffany it is 521 days or almost a year and half tiffany s operating margin is impressive but costco s dramatically better management of its inventory and other assets ensures it earns a higher roce than tiffany many investors prefer return on equity roe i don t roe is calculated after taxes and interest payments and hence mixes operating performance with financing strategy and tax structure as a business owner iam much more concerned with the su perior operating performance of a business while taking on leverage which will improve roe but not roce and planning for taxes may benefit a firm in the short to medium term in my experience success over the long term comes only by running great operations which brings us back to roce what does a high roce of say 20 percent tell us a simple fact this business earns 20 for every 100 it invests this is equivalent to making a bank deposit of 100 and earning 20 on it after a year no you are not ina hyper inflationary latin ameri can economy but in the normal world i assume you would be on the moon if you owned a high roce business like that they are rare but they do exist and when you find them they will tell you a lot high roce is a lot like tameness in the siberian silver foxes just as tameness brings with it a curly tail piebald fur and floppy ears a high roce business ushers in many attributes relevant for an owner like us at nalanda here are some examples a consistently high roce business is likely to be run by an excellent management team what excellent management team again if we can t measure it directly why am i sneaking it in indirectly just because we can t measure management quality through interviews and discussions does not mean quality manage ment teams do not exist of course they do what we need is not some airy fairy impression of an investor made over a coffee or a zoom call but a quantitative measure we don t vote for the best cricket bowler best running back or best marathoner based on their interviews or their ability to articulate their excellence so why should we do it for management teams the best bowling statistics and the best finish times determine the best bowler and the best marathoner similarly in my view an excellent but not the only indicator of the quality of the management team is their historical track record on the quantity of roce sustaining high roce in any industry over any length of time is extraordinarily hard microeconomic theory states that excess returns should be driven to zero in competitive markets which means that businesses need to run very hard simply to earn their cost of capital this may be true for most businesses but there are a select set of companies that defy logic and competition to earn high returns on capital year on year decade after decade the median historical roce of our portfolio of thirty businesses most of which are more than thirty five to forty years old is about 42 percent i am obviously biased since i am an investor in these businesses but i do think the management teams of these businesses are excellent are they exemplary or am i just calling them first rate because they happen to have high roce i don t know does it matter we should expect the following from a quality management team that they deliver products and services to their cus tomers that are superior to those of their competitors allocate capital prudently attract and retain quality employees manage their cost structure which is commensurate with their size and revenue maintain a quality balance sheet and continuously in novate by taking calculated risks all this should and does correlate with high roce aconsistently high roce business is likely to have a strong competitive advantage alllong term investors mentored by more than five decades of buffett s letters and annual meetings demand that companies have a sustainable competitive advantage sca but how does one go about assessing whether a company has an sca if you peruse business and investment books the sources of sca turn out to be the usual suspects brand intellectual property network effect economies of scale and low cost 12 let s analyze brand as a source of competitive advantage almost every investor i know justifies a consumer focused company s stock market success by touting brand and distribution as the sources of competitive advantage one of the great con sumer focused investment success stories began more than thirty years ago in 1988 and 1989 when buffett purchased coke and gillette shares berkshire invested almost 600 million in coke in 1988 and nearly the same amount in gillette in 1989 by 1993 the combined value of these two shareholdings for berkshire was 5 6 billion which was equal to all other holdings combined and buffett was sitting on a gain of about 4 billion in these businesses his commentary on coke and gillette in his 1993 annual letter is as follows the might of their brand names the attributes of their products and the strength of their distribution sys tems give them an enormous competitive advantage setting up a protective moat around their economic castles buffett as usual is correct almost three decades after this letter coke and gillette continue to be enormous successes and given their increasing market share continue to have a solid competitive advantage but did buffett conclude that they hada strong competitive advantage because they had strong brands and product attributes or was his claim based on the empirical fact that these businesses had high roce and an increasing market share over a long period we will never know of course my guess contention is that it was the latter the reality is that most brands don t have any forget about sustainable competitive advantage depending on which source you believe across tens of thousands of brand launches annually in the united states the failure rate is 80 to 90 percent 1 it s not as bad as buying a lottery ticket but it s also not that far off you may also think that failure is limited to small and untested businesses and that the likes of coke and pepsi do very well you would be wrong here is just a small sample of spectacular brand failures from large companies new coke coca cola crystal pepsi pepsi premier smokeless cigarettes r j reynolds maxwell house ready to drink coffee general mills souper combo a combined soup and sandwich meal from campbell and all natural cleaning vinegar heinz just having a brand means nothing if something as simple to understand as a brand does not necessarily confer a compet itive advantage and even if it does it is probably very tough to definitively say so how do we know if a company has a competitive advantage no prizes for guessing yes a sustained high roce is a good starting point to conclude that the company may have some kind of competitive advantage and if it is a consumer company like coca cola maybe it is the brand maybe the distribution maybe the management and maybe some combination of these and other factors once we have short listed a company based on its sustained high roce we start analyzing its competitive advantages after weeks or months of research we may conclude that this high roce is unsustainable and that the company just got lucky histor ically so be it we then choose to stay away but taking this route of starting our assessment of competitive advantage only for high roce companies saves us a lot of time and effort a consistently high roce business allocates capital well as a very long term investor when we choose to buy shares of a business we allocate our capital to that business we are doing so hoping that we will earn a decent return on this capital over the long run hopefully we have evaluated other options for our capital and have made the correct decision that it is best invested in this business investors who allocate capital well perform well those who don t don t businesses are no different they too allocate capital on an ongoing basis they have many options and they try to choose the best one they too hope to earn a decent return on their investment some do most don t roce is an excellent measure of acompany s ability to deploy capital high roce implies that these businesses earn high operating profit relative to their capital deployed great businesses try neither to maximize operating profit nor minimize capital deployed they try to earn the maximum operating profit per unit of capital deployed investors may not realize it but strategy and most capital allocation decisions are deeply intertwined for instance is setting up a manufacturing plant in milwaukee versus outsourcing to china a strategic or a capital allocation decision it doesn t matter it is a decision that will significantly influence the company s success and so it is both some more examples of strategic decisions that allocate capital in radically different ways are as follows setting up one s own r d division versus copying the best designs from the market hiring a chief technology officer to build one s technology unit versus outsourcing it building a manufacturing unit for critical parts versus funding a supplier hiring young graduates and training them over many years versus hiring qualified professionals laterally making an acquisition to enter new geography ver sus growing organically funding a loss making product in a large addressable market versus investing in profitable products ina small market and advertising for many months on social media versus buying a single super bowl ad how does an investor know if these myriad capital allocation decisions are sensible one way is to analyze them thoroughly for example one could interview the marketing head to understand why they bought the super bowl ad instead of spreading the same expense over many weeks or months of advertising on google or facebook one could then build financial models to test the company s likelihood of success compare its advertising strategy to other companies and then reach a conclusion that either sup ports or contradicts its decision the second way our way is to select companies with high roce as the first filter we assume that a company with high roce is on average deploying its capital well it may make some poor decisions but overall we believe its capital allocation and strategic decisions are quite sound also frankly it s just easier this way if i were to try to build multi megabyte spreadsheets to test various scenarios of a particular capital decision i would fail miserably twice once in making the spreadsheet and again in reaching an erroneous conclusion so why try a consistently high roce business allows companies to take business risk without taking financial risk which in creases the chance of business success capitalism thrives on risk taking and risk taking is not limited just to teenagers starting companies in their garages in silicon valley all companies if they want to grow and succeed need to keep taking calculated risks those that don t take risks either atrophy or remain small and irrelevant those that venture to take bigger risks than warranted implode it is in the goldilocks zone of calculated risk taking that most companies thrive high roce allows a company to keep taking calculated business risks this is how acompany delivering high roce with modest revenue growth will generate excess cash this is not an opinion just a mathematical fact for example company x growing its sales at 10 percent with roce of 25 percent can grow from zero cash toa cash balance of almost 18 percent of sales in five years other assumptions margin 15 percent tax 30 percent with an increasing cash cushion x s management team can choose to launch new products or target new geography even if the new business fails x can recover given its ability to generate cash from its core business now let s look at its competitor y which is growing at the same rate 10 percent with the same margin 15 percent but with a lower roce of 12 percent in five years y would have a negative cash balance of 3 percent of revenue in other words y would have to borrow to grow at the same rate as x with a weaker balance sheet and a lack of spare cash y would be forced to either forgo new opportunities or borrow more money to launch a new product or venture in new geography if the venture fails y could be in deep trouble because its core business is not generating enough cash to repay the loan and interest when due this would further widen the gap between companies x and y over time x would grow larger and more successful and y would be just a shadow of x we see this phenomenon play out across many industries in which a few players have tended to become more dom inant given their ability to generate cash on account of high roce what happens if a company with high roce stumbles let me share the example of havells a nalanda portfolio company since 2011 havells is india s largest consumer electrical equipment business and sells fans lights and lighting fixtures circuit breakers wire water heaters and kitchen appliances like blenders and toasters 15 havells delivered 52 percent roce from 2007 to 2017 under its exceptional leader anil gupta its annualized revenue growth was about 15 percent during this period and havells was sitting on a cash balance of 230 million in march 2017 this was about 28 percent of revenue that year in may 2017 havells acquired the consumer business of lloyd electric primarily for lloyd s fast growing air conditioner business we were not too thrilled with this acquisition while the company was clearly not taking a financial risk with the acquisi tion since its cash balance was larger than the acquisition price it was taking a risk that was outside our comfort zone the biggest issue we thought was the difference in culture and company mindset havells sells high quality products at a premium to the discerning indian consumer it does so by setting up high tech manufacturing plants customizing product features to the needs of the consumer staying ahead of the technology curve and creating brand pull by advertising on tv and the internet lloyd seemed to be the exact opposite of havells in many ways it had gained market share over the past decade by ag gressively pushing low priced air conditioners imported from china while havells pulled consumers lloyd pushed its prod ucts by offering large dealer incentives and product discounts lloyd seemed singularly focused on growth at any price whereas havells growth was an outcome of delivering quality products and building the trust of dealers and consumers over six decades prior to lloyd one of the main sources of havells success was its ability to launch new products through its existing sales channel the company has built a loyal and high performing dealership network over many decades this symbiotic relationship has allowed havells to manufacture and sell an extensive range of consumer durables from fans to circuit breakers to toasters however for the first time with the lloyd acquisition havells was unable to use the strength of its dealer network because the air conditioner sales channel was completely different from the consumer electricals channel in india unsurprisingly the company immediately began facing problems with the acquisition it started with the resignation of the ceo of lloyd and many senior managers within a few months of the change in ownership havells found that lloyd was sell ing its products through only a few dealers who had grown quite powerful over the years these dealers were demanding higher margins and a greater share of lloyd s business when havells refused many of these dealers left adversely impacting the sales and profitability of the business there was also some level of dissonance while the havells management tried to reconcile two radically different brand positioning approaches the premium positioning of havells versus the aggressive price warrior stance of lloyd within two years of the acquisition research analysts downgraded havells as lloyd s numbers continued to disappoint at this stage gupta could have taken the easy route of allowing lloyd to revert to its old business ways this would have preserved revenue and profit momentum and created two different kinds of business under the same umbrella but he decided to take the much tougher road of instituting long term fundamental changes to lloyd s organization and business model gupta repositioned the lloyd brand from being a low priced average quality product that offered only basic features toa high quality product whose features matched or exceeded the best in the market havells invested about 35 million to set up anew state of the art air conditioner plant that is now producing high end feature rich air conditioners over many months gupta gradually replaced the senior management of lloyd with leaders steeped in the havells culture the company refused to be blackmailed by a few powerful dealers and built a new more resilient distribution network despite losing sales in the short term lloyd is now integrated with havells and there is complete alignment with their strategic and organizational priorities one key reason havells was able to withstand short term pain to achieve its longer term goals was the availability of cash on the balance sheet and the reason it had accumulated cash was its exceptionally high roce over many years it s easy for any company to claim that it is working for long term value creation but these words are worthless without the courage provided by acash cushion we will never know what would have happened if havells had had a lot of debt and interest to repay but i doubt it would have had the same determination to continue on a challenging lengthy and uncertain path with bankers breathing down its neck havells made a moderately risky acquisition took the time and effort to integrate it despite initial hiccups and converted what could have been a significant misstep into a strategic success anil gupta rocks havells rocks because 52 percent roce rocks there are no guarantees in investing just as selecting for tameness in silver foxes helped dmitri and lyudmila generate many other traits in the animals selecting for high roce has ensured that we have chosen businesses with many other desirable qualities after the companies have been through the risk filter as i discussed in chapter 1 we reject companies with long term historical roce lower than 20 percent our preliminary short list of about 150 companies consists only of those that have delivered roce of more than 20 percent over the past five to ten years or more ihave not claimed that we look only at roce to arrive at our conclusion on a business that would border on being reckless and foolish what i have said though is that we start the evaluation of a business by studying the record of its delivered historical roce if you are an investor or choose to be one you will develop your method and style of investing but whatever you do starting with a good understanding of the historical roce of a business will ensure you are miles ahead of your competition buy one get many free as you may have guessed there are two problems with the approach of choosing roce as the first filter first a consistently high roce in the past does not guarantee that roce will be high in the future for example if a business has a monopoly in its industry say of operating local bus services or a copper mine even a poor quality management team would probably be able to earn a decent return on capital when the monopoly ends however we may see roce trend downward similarly if there is high tariff protection for a product or commodity domestic companies manufac turing the same product or commodity may earn decent profits without breaking a sweat and then there is luck a company can make decent roce for a few years if its key competitors get in trouble of their own making while making the preliminary short list we can easily eliminate these kinds of companies because they are easy to identify however another category of potential losers with high historical roce is tough to identify beforehand a high quality business can also lose its way if the founder gets distracted the company decides to change its strategy the management bets the company ona failed acquisition or an aggressive new competitor makes life difficult for the company while high roce can provide some cushion in the face of these mishaps there are limits to which it can safeguard a business hell bent on destroying itself but remember this chapter is about where you start looking for great businesses not what guarantees great investment re turn spoiler alert nothing does the second problem with making a preliminary list of only high roce businesses is that it rejects companies that may become hugely successful in the future take netflix if we had evaluated netflix in early 2018 its median roce for the previous ten years 2008 to 2017 of 10 percent would have been too low for us to include it on our preliminary list we would have missed out on a spectacular wealth creation opportunity netflix s stock price jumped 2 9 times from january 2018 to december 2021 but here is the thing we would have looked at this lost opportunity and not regretted it one bit i know we will lose netflix like businesses and i am okay with it our strategy of selecting only high roce companies for our initial list invariably excludes some potential winners but it also excludes hundreds of low quality businesses that we would never want to own thus on aver age believe this approach works well for us we will not change our approach just because others have made money with a strategy that we have chosen to avoid cest la vie 2k in early 2022 i wrote to the institute of cytology and genetics at novosibirsk i had two questions for them first was the fox experiment still ongoing and second was lyudmila trut still active i assumed the answer to both would be an emphatic no after all lyudmila had begun the experiment in 1959 more than sixty years ago i was surprised when yury herbeck the deputy head of the laboratory for evolutionary genetics at the institute promptly replied to my email can one be pleasantly shocked if so i was not only is the experiment still ongoing but lyudmila trut who is now almost 90 years old is still active and not only is she active in the institute she is also publishing path breaking scientific articles herbeck was kind enough to attach four research articles published by lyudmila trut and others in prestigious scientific journals in recent years the latest one was published in the journal of neuroscience on july 14 2021 and is titled neuromorphological changes following selection for tameness and ag gression in the russian farm fox experiment i used to feel proud that we have been successfully investing for over fifteen years no longer after reading about lyudmila trut who has maintained her passion discipline and excellence over more than sixty years i am confronted with a stark and painful reality we have a very long way to go chapter summary evolutionary theory has taught me that to avoid getting drowned by a deluge of data and information we can reimagine investing by initially selecting a single business trait that brings with it many favorable business qualities 1 in nature selection for just one trait can influence many other behavioral and physical qualities of an organism 2 dmitri belyaev and lyudmila trut s long term experiment in siberia has shown that selecting for tameness in wild silver foxes transforms them into a creature not unlike a pet dog over very few generations the foxes become docile and crave human attention they also develop floppy ears a piebald coloration and a shorter snout and can be reproductively active more than once a year 3 investors could benefit immensely by homing in on a business trait that when selected brings along many other favorable qualities with it some popular parameters like management quality high growth and high margins are inappropriate or inadequate 4 the single business quality that correlates favorably with many other areas of business excellence is historical return on capital employed roce we start our analysis by selecting only those businesses that have historically delivered high roce 5 high roce generally but not necessarily indicates that the management team is stellar they allocate capital effectively they have built a strong competitive advantage over their peers and they have room to innovate and grow 6 selecting for roce is a good starting point of analysis it helps us narrow down our choices we do a lot more work to create a short list of attractive businesses after this initial filter 7 however not all businesses with high historical roce will necessarily continue to be considered good businesses there are no guarantees in investing chapter 3 the paradox of mckinsey and sea urchins moreover when a modification of structure has primarily arisen from the above or unknown causes it may at first have been of no advan tage to the species but may subsequently have been taken advantage of by the descendants of the species under new conditions of life and with newly acquired habits charles darwin on the origin of species chapter 6 difficulties of the theory we rarely use much debt and when we do we attempt to structure it on a long term fixed basis we will reject interesting opportunities rather than over leverage our balance sheet this conservatism has penalized our results but it is the only behavior that leaves us comfort able considering our fiduciary obligations to policyholders depositors lenders and the many equity holders who have committed unusu ally large portions of their net worth to our care warren buffett annual letter to shareholders 1983 he world is shrunk into a few square miles of new york the filth of mumbai the art of berlin the style of paris the food of london the bustle of tokyo the gaudiness of shanghai the rudeness of delhi the shopping of singapore the decadence of monaco the chaos of cairo and the magnificence of its own i love it this is why we hold nalanda s an nual investor meeting in the city every year in late june when my son was young oh why do they grow up he had two favorite spots in new york over time they became mine too the central park zoo and the fao schwarz toy store on fifth avenue our favorite activities there were petting the baby ani mals and dancing on the giant piano i remember fao schwarz less for its dazzling array of toys many of which we bought over the years and more for being soaked in wonder and amazement there were magicians rubik s cube artists giant cuddly pandas other worldly jugglers and on one occasion a group of singers and dancers who rivaled broadway performers growing up in semi urban india i had never been to a toy store before and i am not sure to this day if our visits to this iconic institution were more exciting for my son or me after our ninth annual meeting in 2016 i remember walking up fifth avenue waiting to be mesmerized by something new in the store but it wasn t there a quick google search on my phone sank my spirits the store had shut permanently how in the world could this have happened why would the store be closed when it was almost always teeming with cus tomers and there never seemed to be enough cash registers the mystery of mckinsey mckinsey the global strategy consulting firm decided to enter india in 1992 following the beginning of the economic liberaliza tion of the country in 1991 1 it decided to hire fresh interns from two mba schools in the country india did not have strategy con sulting firms in 1992 and none of us knew anything about the industry remember that there was no internet then so we could not even do basic research on the industry or the company our professors too were clueless i was a final year mba student in one of those two schools the firm as it is called by insiders for some inexplicable reason had decided to pay more than twice the next highest paying company citibank the entire mba class applied including me no one cared what mckinsey did the lure of the lucre was too strong to resist ihappened to be at the right place at the right time isn t that life and was one of five mba graduates hired i was there for about six years mckinsey is a great institution although life was quite tough too many powerpoint presentations and too many air miles i enjoyed the competitive camaraderie the satisfaction of working with cxos and its global oneness i worked in four different international offices in six years having spent many years in the outside world after my departure from mckinsey my admiration for the firm has grown over the years as it has continued to dominate its industry mckinsey was founded in 1926 by james o mckinsey but the man who deserves the lion s share of credit for building the firm to its current glory is marvin bower who joined in 1933 he transformed the small engineering and accounting firm into the management consulting powerhouse it is today in the ninety plus years since mckinsey s founding the firm has suffered cataclysmic internal and external shocks let s start with some of the external shocks first the great depression the second world war rapid decolonization the cold war the oil shock multiple recessions in the united states and other major economies of the world the population explosion massive poverty reduction the creation and destruction of conglomerates the hollowing out of manufacturing in the united states the rise of china the exponential increase in computing power and communications technology including the internet the global financial crisis and the covid 19 pandemic to name a few as the external world was undergoing rapid change mckinsey itself worked through a few internal shocks the transfer of power from marvin bower to the next generation in the late 1950s repeated internal pressures for the firm to go public including when i was there the imprisonment of anil kumar and rajat gupta its massive expansion into new geographies and industry segments over the years its dubious fees arrangement with the south african utility eskom and the 600 million settlement for its work with the opioid manufacturer purdue pharma not many of mckinsey s competitors survived the rapid pace of change in the rough and tumble world of consulting remember monitor or booz on the other hand mckinsey has not only survived but also continued to prosper doing exactly what it has always done act as a trusted adviser to the cxos the firm at its core has remained stubbornly immune to external and in ternal shocks but here is the funny even weird reality the firm while remaining robust to change has also changed dramatically over the past decades it started in the united states but is now also in cairo casablanca and chengdu it primarily offered strategic consulting until the 1990s but has expanded into operational and technology consulting it used to serve mostly manufacturers in its early days but you will now find it crawling all over google facebook or a hot new start up in the valley in my time it rarely hired laterally but according to friends who are now senior partners the company now hires hundreds of experienced industry specialists living organisms are highly robust mba degrees management seminars best selling business books and corporate titans all seem focused on ensuring that compa nies adapt to change and evolve into a better version of themselves if one could bottle up corporate obsession the label on this bottle would declare how do we change faster better and easier i beg to differ the question that should be on the minds of business leaders and investors is almost the exact opposite how do we change without changing let s turn to evolutionary biology to understand why biologists have always been aware of a strange conundrum of the living world organisms animals plants algae fungi and even bacteria are incredibly complex but they are not delicate on the contrary they have survived and thrived for hundreds of millions of years and in the case of bacteria billions of years despite continuous assault from the turbulent and dynamic external environment even their internal environments seem to be constantly revolting against them in the form of unceasing mutations despite these external and internal perturbations not only have living things survived but they have also successfully diversified into millions of species they occupy almost every available niche on our planet from icy glaciers to boiling deep sea thermal vents one of the greatest wonders of this world is this living things are highly resistant to internal and external changes while simultaneously possessing the ability to evolve 2 let me call this ability to function well despite internal and external distur bances robustness if the first proto single celled organism were too robust it would have remained unchanged over 3 5 billion years and we would not have had mushrooms or meerkats or manhattan on the other hand if it were not robust enough it would have gone extinct quite quickly in the volcanic and violent days of the early earth you and i and all the living things we see around us are here because organic life has been able to strike a delicate balance between maintaining the status quo and evolving when the need arises how does this happen and what can we learn from it as investors this dual trick of changing while remaining unchanged results from two separate but intimately linked phenomena first living systems are robust at multiple levels second this robustness helps neutral mutations become the source of future innovations what multiple levels and what is a neutral mutation does this sound like gobbledygook let s start at the start our mother our creator the dna deoxyribonucleic acid molecule the dna molecule in any organism be it a plant or a human being serves two key functions it carries information to build the body parts of an organism for example skin kidney petals leaves and is transmitted to offspring dna based genetic code determines who we are and what our children will be the dna molecule is shaped in the form of a double helix and consists of four types of units called nucleotides a adenosine c cytosine g guanine and t thymine as shown at the top of figure 3 1 a gene comprises a chain of nucleotides that can number from a few hundred to a couple of million i have shown nine nucleo tides here for illustration these dna nucleotides always exist in pairs called base pairs the t nucleotide always pairs with a and the c nucleotide always pairs with g figure 3 1 shows just one half of a base pair with the sequence acggatcga dna chain mrna sequence u gc c u ag amino acids cc _ c__ _c_ tyrosine leucine alanine codon 3 1 dna makes mrna makes protein the dna of all organisms comprises the same four nucleotides a c g and t just think about it for a moment orchids and orangutans share these same four nucleotides in their dna code they are just arranged differently in each human beings have three billion base pairs of nucleotides not in our whole body in almost every cell of our body i find this quite astounding re member that the next time you are packing a tight suitcase and just because we rule the world does not mean we have the largest genome the size of the human genome is quite unremarkable the lowly amoeba dubia a single celled organism has 670 billion base pairs in its dna that makes for a genome about 220 times larger than yours and mine 2 for this discussion let s focus just on genes that manufacture proteins we are all essentially a bag of proteins proteins build bodies and regulate defend and monitor their functioning our body parts differ because they have different proteins for instance keratin makes our skin hemoglobin carries oxygen in our blood and proteins called immunoglobulins defend us from parasites dna makes protein in a two step process the first being transcription and the second translation first a single strand of dna with a long chain of a c t and g nucleotides gets transcribed onto a complementary messenger rna ribonucleic acid se quence called mrna yes this molecule is the basis of the covid 19 vaccines made by pfizer biontech and moderna thus the dna sequence acggatcga shown in figure 3 1 will get transcribed to the mrna sequence ugccuagcu what is this new letter u in the transcription process the dna nucleotide a adenosine gets transcribed onto the mrna nucleotide u uracil and as described earlier c pairs with g and t with a adna sequence has produced a corresponding mrna sequence what now in the second step a sequence of mrna mole cules is translated into a sequence of amino acids that synthesize a protein mrna is a single stranded molecule and it comprises codons made of three nucleotides that code for specific amino acids in the mrna sequence ugccuagcu shown in figure 3 1 the first codon ugc makes the amino acid tyrosine the second codon cua codes for leucine and the third codon gcu codes for the amino acid alanine a sequence of amino acids folds into a protein voila dna made mrna which then made a protein if you are a biologist i hope you haven t had a heart attack i know that these few lines don t fully capture the complexities and nuances of the working of the universal genetic code we haven t covered rrna trna noncoding dna or enzymes but hey this is not a biology textbook and i am simply trying to lay the basic groundwork to make sure we all have the same basic under standing of genetic code before moving ahead to comprehend the robustness of living organisms at multiple levels let s start at the bottom the universal genetic code the genetic code is robust as mentioned a codon comprising three bases creates an amino acid thus the codon agc creates the amino acid serine and ggc makes glycine since any of the four nucleotides a c u or g can occupy one of the three bases there are sixty four possible amino acids 4 x 4 x 4 however only twenty exist in nature how so this is because two or more codons can code for the same amino acid for instance ggu ggc gga and ggg are all glycine thus any mutation on the third position of the codon with the first two positions gg will always form glycine these are called synonymous mutations the formation of glycine is thus highly robust to mutations on the third base overall the universal genetic code has funneled down sixty four possibilities to just twenty through this type of synonymous mutation synonymous mutations are just the first level of robustness scientists have found that translation errors errors at the point of codon formation are most likely at the third position and least likely at the first position amazingly the degree of robustness is also highest at the third position of the codon as in the earlier example of glycine thus even though the third posi tion is most error prone in translation it will have no impact on the type of amino acid formed in other words evolution has en sured that the genetic code is extremely robust to mutations and translation errors isn t that cool proteins are robust let s now go one level beyond the genetic code to see if proteins are robust to changes in the sequence of amino acids as discussed a protein is a large molecule made up of a certain amino acid sequence they are in all living organisms and are directly involved in all the chemical processes essential for creating and sustaining life thus given the stability of life forms one would expect proteins to show a high degree of robustness and that is exactly what we see there are three types of protein robustness first scientists have found that the function of proteins is unaffected by the vast majority of amino acid changes for example the bacteria e coli carries a protein called b lactamase which confers antibiotic resistance this protein has 263 amino acids 84 percent of which can experience mutation i e they can be changed into another amino acid without changing the enzyme s basic function ponder that it would be like making 84 mistakes on a math exam com prising 100 questions and still getting an a the second type of robustness results from proteins with similar functions and structures being able to be made from different amino acid sequences for example myoglobin and hemoglobin are oxygen binding proteins in vertebrates and they have many distant relatives in invertebrates like crabs and spiders and plants the three dimensional structure of whale myo globin and clam hemoglobin can be almost perfectly superimposed despite this uncanny structural and functional similarity the amino acid sequences of the two are very different only 18 percent of the amino acids of the whale myoglobin and clam hemoglo bin overlap third scientists have found that the vast majority of amino acid sequences fold into very few structures no i really mean it very few let s see how few a small protein may have 100 amino acids and so the number of possible protein folds is 20190 which is more than the number of atoms in the universe 2 and how many proteins exist about 10 000 or 203 thus protein structure and function are extremely robust the body is robust let s now go one level up from proteins to the body by taking the example of sea urchins sea urchins evolved 250 million years ago and comprise about 1 000 species for now we will focus on just two found in shallow waters in australia heliocidaris tuberculata and heliocidaris erythrogramma let s call them species t and e their body plans are conserved in other words they look the same but have dramatically different modes of development t produces larvae called pluteus that bear no physical resemblance to the adult and these free swimming pluteus feed on plankton as they grow into adulthood e on the other hand develops directly from an egg with no larval stage in between but t and e are quite closely related and diverged only about five million years ago almost the same time that chimpanzees and humans diverged it would be as if chimps produced larvae that did not look like adult chimps the entire development programs the shape and size of eggs the location of cell formation for various body parts the activation of genes that control development of these two species differ so significantly that it is almost unbelievable that the two species have a common ancestor from only five million years ago despite these massive developmental changes if you do a google search for images of t and e you will notice that they look almost the same how have the sea urchins maintained their body plans while changing many fundamental aspects of their development and what have they achieved by maintaining highly robust body plans while evolving drastically different routes of development we will get to these questions in a moment but for now let me summarize what we have learned we have seen that the stability of living organisms and species is maintained through robustness at multiple levels at the levels of genetic code proteins and even body plan for the sake of brevity i have chosen to omit details of robustness at many other levels changes in the secondary structure of rna changes in the regulatory regions of a gene and drastic changes in en zyme activity just to name a few a mutation changes the dna sequence of a gene no problem it produces the same amino acid the amino acid sequence changes owing to mutation or recombination no problem it produces the same protein there is a change in the arrangement of proteins no problem the same enzyme activity continues and so on living things are built to be resilient and resistant to change the evolution of evolvability this gets us to the paradox i mentioned at the start of the chapter given multiple levels of robustness how in the world do species evolve should they not stay fixed what propelled bacteria to become bonobos the short and incredible answer is that robustness itself leads to evolvability we need to make a brief foray into one aspect of the history of molecular biology to unravel the paradox in 1968 the japa nese geneticist motoo kimura proposed the neutral theory of molecular evolution kimura contended that most changes at the level of dna and amino acids do not impact the function of a molecule and hence the organism s ability to survive and reproduce he contended that a small number of mutations are favorable and natural selection preserves them some mutations are rejected because they are harmful but most mutations don t really affect the organism according to kimura most mutations are neutral which causes robustness in the organism so how does neutral mutation lead to evolution while a neutral change does not alter the primary function it can alter a secondary function thereby becoming the source of a future innovation let s say gene a has primary function f owing to a mutation gene a becomes gene b but since it s a robust system gene b continues to perform function f but gene b affects a secondary function fs fs does not alter the fitness of the organism but can be used by the organism s descendants for a completely new function thereby leading to evolution thus although the genetic code was robust because gene a changing into gene b did not affect function f the addition of function fs allowed the organism to evolve ina robust biological system evolvability comes free let s now return to the sea urchin example t and e have maintained their body plans robustness while changing their development cycle through neutral mutations over millions of years for example 16 of the 32 cells of the t embryo become the ectoderm the outer layer of skin whereas 26 of the 32 e embryo cells do so the sea urchins body structures have stayed robust to multiple changes in embryonic development as a result they have exploited a completely new ecological niche and a novel way of life for example e is abundant in deep seas and polar latitudes where t cannot survive this is because e develops directly and does not need to go through the larval stage critically dependent on plankton for survival something similar has been happening at mckinsey over the past century today s mckinsey bears no resemblance to marvin bower s mckinsey in terms of geographical presence organization processes type of client work and breadth of expertise but at some fundamental level of culture oneness problem solving and working with cxos the firm has remained stubbornly boweresque it has changed without changing this is what we seek as owners in our businesses the ability to keep evolving while staying robust businesses must be robust to evolve let s recap our journey until now we have eliminated serious risks chapter 1 and have shortlisted businesses based on roce chapter 2 now we need to select companies for their robustness here are some learnings we have internalized at nalanda robustness takes many forms how does an investor measure robustness in a business i wish i had a simple quantitative answer i don t like almost everything in investing the solution is somewhat subjective somewhat vague and somewhat controversial but it works for us the best way to understand robustness is to contrast the two extremes listed in table 3 1 table 3 1 examples of robustness in a business most robust least robust has delivered high historical roce over a long period has a fragmented customer base has no debt and has excess cash has built high competitive barriers has a fragmented supplier base has a stable management team industry is slow changing has made operating losses for most or all of its history is dependent on very few customers is highly leveraged has been unable to keep competition away is dependent on a few suppliers management turnover is high industry is evolving fast this is not an exhaustive list but i hope you will get the general drift of what i mean when i say a business is robust a robust business lies on a continuum between the two poles described in the table with a bias toward the left side you will notice that unlike in chapter 2 where we used the quantitative criterion of roce to select businesses many factors contributing to robustness are qualitative also almost no business falls entirely within the left or right column in my experience robustness is not a black and white measure thankfully or else what would separate a good investor from a great one different investors attribute different weights to the factors listed in table 3 1 for instance many investors do not consider customer concentration to be a problem for a business we do we took advantage of these contrasting opinions a few months after the inception of nalanda wns is an indian business process outsourcing bpo company with a u s listing the leading bpo companies like wns provide many mission critical services to their clients of a quality and at a price that can typically not be matched by the com pany s internal teams for example they help their clients close the books of accounts manage payables and receivables perform timely consumer analytics process mortgage applications and address customer issues we had been tracking wns since we started nalanda in 2007 despite its high roce zero debt strong competitive advantage and stable management team we did not like the business because of its dependence on just a few customers in 2006 wns s top five customers accounted for 41 percent of revenue and in 2007 this number had jumped to 55 percent 2 we worried that the company s robustness was low and declining but the markets did not seem to care and wns s stock price reached 35 by the middle of 2007 wns lost a major client in the latter half of 2007 and another client threatened to terminate their agreement this wasn t great news in the short term and the markets punished wns severely the stock crashed to 13 in early 2008 however we con cluded that the company would become more robust with a more fragmented customer base we bought about 6 percent of the business from january to march 2008 fast forward thirteen years and in 2020 wns s top five clients accounted for only 25 per cent of revenue what was supposedly lousy news in 2007 looked pretty good in 2020 we assess evolvability indirectly by measuring robustness directly as permanent owners we nalanda folks are hungry for companies that can successfully implement neutral strategies to evolve and adapt to a changing environment we want evolvability correction we need evolvability having invested we need the busi ness to survive the onslaught of ai or other technologies to upstage its increasing online and offline competition to withstand multiple recessions to conquer the adverse effects of climate change to survive management turnover and much more we need it to be able to adapt however just as evolutionary biologists struggle to measure evolvability 12 i haven t yet figured out a reliable way in advance to directly assess a company s propensity to adapt to a changing world many investors contend that management interviews and discussions are an excellent way to assess the future adaptability of a business maybe i consider such interviews a waste of time but more on that later in chapter 7 but there is an indirect and i would argue a reasonably reliable path of satisfying my need it is by measuring the robust ness of an organization robustness lays the groundwork for evolution in living things it does the same in businesses robustness is a necessary though not sufficient requirement for businesses to evolve successfully ina robust business just as in a living organism evolvability comes free take the example of two businesses in an industry company a is the leader and on sales of 100 it earns a margin of 20 per cent let s assume its capital employed in fixed assets receivables and inventory is 50 company a s roce is quite healthy at 40 percent 100 x 20 50 ifa company s growth is lower than its roce it will also keep generating free cash flow and so company ahas no debt company b is a weak player in the industry with half the sales of company a 50 and a margin of 15 percent since it does not have enough bargaining power with suppliers who demand early payment or customers who pay late its capital employed is the same as that of company a 50 company b s roce is 15 percent 50 x 15 50 company b has a debt of 10 which is not much given its operating profit of 7 50 and its cost of debt is 5 percent thus both are earning decent roce and have a reasonably strong balance sheet company a is better but company bisn t too bad all seems fine until it s not covid 19 strikes and the country goes into a lockdown sales at both companies fall by half and so do the operating margins company a being a leader can collect cash and liquidate inventory so that its capital employed falls to 25 company b on the other hand while suffering the same drop in sales and margins as company a is rebuffed by its customers while asking for money and is also unable to sell its finished goods in a demand poor environment its capital employed stays flat at 50 company a s roce is now 20 percent 50 x 10 25 and company b s is 4 percent 25 x 7 5 50 thus even during the pandemic company a earns a respectable roce allowing it to invest in growth fortified by its roce of 20 percent company a can also borrow in the market if it needs to since the cost of debt is just 5 percent and the company is debt free from being comfortably mediocre during the pre pandemic era company b risks oblivion because it no longer has the money to invest in production marketing and distribution at 4 percent roce it would struggle to pay its debt at 5 percent given its precarious balance sheet and declining profits lenders would also hesitate to lend it more money at least in the near term a likely outcome is that company a gains market share and company b further loses its position since company a had a higher degree of robustness owing to its high roce it could adapt and evolve in an adverse external environment what i have outlined is not a theoretical construct we have seen this story play out in many of our businesses when the pandemic began the general opinion was that all indian businesses would suffer sharp stock market declines in march and april 2020 mirrored this opinion however as the months passed the differences in the impact on the business of companies with differential degrees of robustness became quite stark during and after the covid crisis we have seen these divergent outcomes play out across many of our companies and industries be it paint innerwear air conditioners tires pipes or batteries one of the best run companies in our portfolio is page industries which we were very fortunate to buy a few days after the collapse of lehman in late 2008 page is the exclusive licensee for the jockey brand in india and is the largest seller of innerwear in the country page aggressively launched new products during the pandemic and opened new stores while many of its competi tors either vanished or were significantly weakened there are four listed innerwear companies in india the other three being maxwell rupa and lovable page s market share among its listed peers in december 2018 was already relatively high at 66 percent however by december 2020 page s market share had grown to 70 percent we don t have data for the dozens of unlisted companies but from anecdotal evidence and feed back from industry insiders it appears that page s market share gain over this group during the pandemic has been even greater i believe page s robustness was a significant if not the primary or only reason for its continued success during the crisis let s see how page scores on the various factors contributing to robustness listed in table 3 1 for the year ended march 2020 page s roce was 63 percent and it was debt free it has highly fragmented customer and supplier bases in my opinion it has built a deep and wide moat by investing in brand and distribution over twenty five years it has had the same owner since 1995 its in dustry is changing very slowly with the top players remaining the same for more than a decade the greater the robustness the greater the evolvability we demand multiple levels of robustness in our businesses there is an unbroken chain of life between us and our last universal common ancestor scientists call it luca 3 5 billion years ago 12 every part of this unbroken and evolving lineage has had robustness at multiple levels genes proteins and body plan to name just three in a not dissimilar manner i have discovered over more than two decades of investing that more levels of robust ness lead to more evolvability let s revisit table 3 1 which lists seven factors of robustness as i have mentioned there are more factors one can conjure for example propensity for m a governance but let s stick with these seven for now my aim is to point you in a certain direc tion not to spoon feed we want our companies to tilt toward the left side of table 3 1 across all factors thus we want the business to be robust at the level of roce and concentration of customer base and degree of leverage and strength of competitive advantage and so on is this asking for a lot you bet we are permanent owners the key word here being permanent if a business can t last permanently we don t want to own it without several levels of robustness how will we be sure that the business will survive over the long term i wish i could categorically answer the question is this a robust business as a practicing investor i know that assessing robustness is a matter of judgment and that there is no shortcut to this process i have arrived at a certain heuristic after many years of investing there clearly are black and white extremes to robustness e g a business with just two customers but in many maybe even most businesses it is the gray zone that stares at us for example is acompany with a debt equity ratio of 2 0 robust probably not what about a ratio of 0 2 or 0 5 maybe for me the answer depends on the other factors of robustness almost all the companies in our portfolio are debt free still in 2010 we invested in india s leading plastic pipes business used in homes and agriculture supreme industries whose debt ebitda ratio was 0 6 not high but not zero either despite the company having debt which was small to begin with we concluded that the company was robust because it was the clear industry leader had been gaining market share over its competitors had a return on capital of more than 30 percent had successfully designed and launched many products over the past decade had thousands of distribution points across india was able to negotiate the best terms with its suppliers and had not wasted time and money on unnecessary acquisitions it was not perfectly robust but it was resilient enough today the company is debt free and continues to be the industry leader by a wide margin the more levels of robustness the more we salivate highly robust businesses evolve by taking calculated risks as we have learned neutral mutations make an organism robust while simultaneously planting the seeds of evolution in the business world neutral changes may not have a short term impact but may be transformational over the long run the corporate phenomenon equivalent to biological neutral mutations can be summarized in two words calculated risks there are millions of small businesses across the world that are incredibly robust but will stay small and then there are businesses that test the limits of robustness and implode the former risk nothing and the latter risk everything the goldilocks zone between these two extremes is what i call calculated risk it is the degree of risk that makes managers uncomfortable but not too much it compels the organization to innovate but not too much it forces the business to invest but not too much and it adds areas of potential growth but not too many to me the company that best demonstrates calculated aggression and risk taking is walmart small digression let s see if you know the answer to this question what was sam walton s age when he founded walmart if your answer begins with a one or a two your answer was the same as mine and like i was you are wrong sam walton was forty four when he opened his first wal mart store in 1962 in rogers arkansas wal mart became walmart in 2018 not all the great founders of the modern era are from silicon valley not all of them were hard charging teenagers and not all of them wanted to change the world after graduating from college walton started in sales at j c penney in 1940 then enlisted for the war in 1942 in 1945 he started managing a franchise ben franklin store in newport arkansas where the population was then seven thousand by 1950 he was running two stores in newport and had achieved reasonable success by experimenting and innovating one of his inno vative ideas that had been a massive hit with his customers was an ice cream machine as he writes in his autobiography every crazy thing we tried hadn t turned out as well as the ice cream machine of course but we hadn t made any mistakes we couldn t correct quickly none so big that they threatened the business could there be a better definition of calculated risk after walmart s initial success in rogers sam walton opened more stores 4 by 1967 he had opened twenty four stores which brought in sales of about 13 million the company reached 1 billion in sales in 1980 by which time it had 276 stores and about 21 000 associates note that store openings and selling more products through the same stores propelled growth from 1967 to 1980 during these thirteen years sales per store had increased about seven times how had walton done this by continuously trying new things expanding product offerings and broadening the customer base not all these experiments were successful for example in the early 1980s walton started two hypermarts giant stores selling groceries and general merchandise in the dallas fort worth area but the concept failed he also experimented with dis counted drugs dot discount drug and home improvement save mor both of which shuttered one of his experiments however worked spectacularly well sam s club focused on retailers who buy in bulk was launched in 1983 and within a decade it had crossed revenue of 10 billion the spectacular success of sam s club demonstrates the slight downside and colossal upside of tak ing manageable risks as discussed in chapter 1 most m a fail and the larger ones can destroy a business walmart has managed acquisitions the way they should be managed it has kept targets small and manageable and funded them without taking on large debt the company made its first acquisition fifteen years after inception it was close to 500 million in sales and by this time as is evident from his autobiography sam walton was feeling quite confident about the future of the business even then he behaved pru dently by acquiring a small discount store business called mohr value in 1977 which was about one tenth the size of walmart as he says in his book we closed five stores and converted the remaining sixteen to wal marts and it wasn t much of a shock to our system by 1991 walmart was present in forty nine states and the management started exploring options outside their home country almost two decades after the first store s inauguration walmart embarked on its maiden international foray by entering into a joint venture with cifra mexico s largest retailer and by 1997 it had acquired a majority position in cifra was this a neu tral change it sure seems like one in hindsight the mexico joint venture started small and would not have impacted walmart s us operations also a joint venture in a foreign country allowed walmart to dip a toe to check the water temperature once the company had adjusted to the new geography it felt confident in making a bigger commitment by acquiring the rest of cifra starting from scratch in 1991 walmart s revenue from the international segment in 2020 was 120 billion or 23 percent of com pany sales 15 the company did something similar small measured and low risk when it launched its web business in 2000 walmart joined hands with a leading silicon valley investment firm accel partners to launch walmart com accel by the way gained much fame and a gargantuan fortune as a result of its 12 7 million investment in an early stage company called facebook in 2005 1 in about eighteen months in mid 2001 walmart acquired the minority stake of accel to own walmart com fully by 2020 walmart s e commerce sales had climbed to 24 billion and walmart com was approaching 10 percent of walmart s overall u s sales what had started as a neutral strategy in 2000 is now fast becoming the centerpiece of walmart s approach to gaining market share one of our largest investors is a well known u s university endowment they have been investing in funds globally for many decades their cfo visited our singapore office in 2011 after he had finished grilling us on compliance and other related matters i wanted to know if he could share any learnings with us he said that the one industry in which their fund managers had consistently lost money across time and geographies was retailing in this context walmart s success is awe inspiring and how robust was walmart at the end of 2020 let me point to just two indicators its return on tangible capital employed was 46 percent thus for day to day operations in 2020 it deployed 49 7 billion capital to earn an operating income of 22 9 billion its net debt level was just 26 8 billion substantially lower than its equity value of 52 billion and ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization of 38 billion its continued robustness has helped the management take calculated risks in the united states as well as across the globe i don t want to pretend that walmart s success is solely the result of its slow and steady approach to growth and expansion walmart has undoubtedly flourished for many reasons apart from sam walton being the founder though i don t know what other factors have led to its success i can rattle off a list of things from various business books and articles written on walmart but i don t know if they were the cause or the effect of its success but i do know that taking calculated risks and staying robustly healthy have had a strong correlation with its accomplishments over sixty years as it has been for almost all the nalanda portfolio companies when we first invested in page industries in 2008 it primarily manufactured and sold men s innerwear here are some of the milestones and neutral strategies implemented by page since then 2008 09 primarily a men s innerwear company 2009 10 launched women s leisurewear men s sportswear 2010 11 first store for women in delhi first training center for production staff 2011 12 boys and girls ranges signed exclusive licensee agreement with speedo 2012 13 sleepwear range for women men s performance stretch range thermals 2013 14 new international format retail outlets seamless sleepwear for women 2014 15 exclusive outlets in dubai abu dhabi 2015 16 boys collection 7 12 years 2017 18 girls inner and outerwear men s and women s athleisure 2018 19 teenage girls range 2019 20 first digital manufacturing unit with real time production data the remarkable aspect of this list is what it doesn t include there are no acquisitions no unrelated diversifications no visionary plans to change the world no financial engineering only measured risks for example in 2009 10 the company launched men s sportswear it did so through its existing distribution channel and staff its current manufacturing units and the same brand name as the sportswear segment has expanded over the years it now has its own supply chain its own business unit and its own advertisements you will notice here that the company launched a children s range in 2011 12 page describes this natural extension of the jockey brand in its annual report with the launch of jockey kids the brand reaches out to the consumers of tomorrow keep ing comfort as our topmost priority we have brought in a range using 100 percent cotton super soft absorbent fabric for both boys and girls as investors in page we were excited about this new target segment because it would double the jockey brand s ad dressable market after seventeen years in india page had earned the right to extend its brand into a new segment unexpectedly it failed the children s range did not do well and the company withdrew its products did this have any negative impact on the finance or oper ations of the company no this is because it was a calculated risk it was a neutral strategy that did not affect the robustness of the business its operating roce in 2011 12 was 59 percent and was even higher in 2012 13 when it realized the children s range had failed at 64 percent in 2012 13 overall sales grew 26 percent and profits rose 24 percent in both these years the company had negligible debt the advantage of having a solid foundation that allowed it to take small bets was evident page went back to the drawing board and launched only a boys collection in 2015 16 even within this segment it intro duced products only for boys aged seven to twelve years why not five or thirteen year old boys i have no idea i don t understand product marketing but thankfully page does it launched girls inner and outerwear a year later by 2020 the boys and girls ranges had become a hit and had started contributing to the overall sales and profit growth of the business what had started as a small experiment in 2011 12 was finally yielding fruit as india went into a full lockdown in mid march 2020 owing to the covid 19 pandemic the company s annual sales grew only 3 percent for the year ended march 2020 profits fell 15 percent but it delivered roce of 63 percent while remaining debt free this robustness we believe should allow the company to continue to take calculated strategic bets many years into the future robustness is a proxy for evolutionary and business success but doesn t guarantee it dinosaurs a diverse group of more than a thousand reptilian species dominated our planet for 180 million years 12 as a matter of comparison we homo sapiens have been around for less than 0 2 million years dinosaurs couldn t have survived and thrived for so long unless they were highly robust and adaptable molecular evidence has shown that many modern mammalian orders carnivora primata proboscidea coexisted with dinosaurs for at least 30 million years during the cretaceous period 145 to 66 million years ago and maybe even earlier the mammals during the era of dinosaurs were small squirrel sized and probably insectivores if aliens had landed on our planet 65 million years ago they never could have predicted that a small offshoot of the insignificant mammalians would reign supreme one day the cataclysmic aftermath of an asteroid strike in the yucatan peninsula 65 million years ago wiped out the dinosaurs but the mammals survived no one is sure why the extraordinary robustness of dinosaurs did not guarantee their evolvability in general the greater the robustness the greater the evolvability but sometimes robustness ceases to help businesses adapt we can see this in gap s failure to grow despite the company being very robust its revenue stayed flat at about 16 billion from 2005 to 2020 although it delivered roce of 20 percent or more for more than a decade and had no leverage in general mul tiple levels of robustness are better than a single level but sometimes even multiple levels of robustness can t safeguard the future of a business as has been the case for thousands of newspapers across the world in general highly robust businesses evolve by tak ing calculated risks but sometimes very rarely businesses can succeed by taking huge risks as shown by netflix we at nalanda never bet against the odds and so despite some rare counterexamples we have kept and will continue to keep robustness at the front and center of our investment approach as permanent owners we seek robustness in companies as the best available benchmark to assess if they are likely to adapt and survive over the long term a better measure may exist but i don t know what it is we invest only in highly robust companies many of them have stayed robust and have grown their sales and profits over decades but our track record is not perfect we have witnessed two key problems with this approach first a business can lose its robustness we saw this happen to one of our consumer focused companies we still don t know how or why it lost its way we invested in this business almost twenty years after its creation during that period the management had built the largest brand in its industry in the country when we invested the company had no debt its sales had grown 20 percent annually for the past five years and it had delivered roce of more than 50 percent within a few years of our investing the company s inventory and receivables started climbing steeply a leading indicator of potential sales issues while the company continued to show profits it had begun consuming cash while having been a cash generator in earlier years as a result it had to start borrowing money just as its ability to repay the loans declined being a permanent owner we are tolerant of declining sales or margins or market share but we will not risk survivability as the company s robustness nose dived we exited the business at a loss the company survives but is a pale reflection of its former glory this unexplained decline of robustness has occurred in our portfolio only once since our inception in 2007 but it has happened the second problem is too much robustness one high quality business in the nalanda portfolio has been too robust it has been unable or unwilling to implement any neutral strategies to expand its customer base product segments or geographies as a result the company has grown its sales at less than 5 percent annually for a decade and its profits have stayed flat during this pe riod to be fair its industry has gone through a vicious downcycle and this business is the only one among its peers that continues to generate profits and free cash flow and it remains debt free it is also the only business in our portfolio that has taken robustness to its extreme by eschewing calculated risks maybe it is in an industry in which it can t or shouldn t perhaps when the industry upcycle arrives it will finally see growth or maybe not we will continue to remain owners in the business while our returns have been positive they have been below par but i love them they are a class apart in a very tough place we are willing to sacri fice growth for robustness we have made almost forty investments to date and in all of them robustness was a primary but not the only selection criterion we have worked on the assumption that robustness will lead to growth and evolution this assumption has failed us on two occasions one in which the company lost robustness and another in which the company s excessive focus on robustness compromised growth i am surprised at our strategy s low failure rate we have been quite lucky and while robustness should con tinue to reward us across our portfolio we will continue to encounter failures of the first or second kind over time the only way to protect against loss of robustness is entry valuation confronted with a like challenge to distill the secret of sound investment into three words we venture the motto margin of safety emphasis in the original text this is the best advice for investors in the best chapter of the best investing book ever written the intelligent investor by benjamin graham buffett s actual and spiritual mentor the chapter is titled margin of safety as the central concept of investment graham knew that the corporate world is highly uncertain and that the best protection offered to an investor is the price they pay for a business another investment legend seth klarman offers the following advice in his book appropriately titled margin of safety risk averse value investing strategies for the thoughtful investor value investing the strategy of investing in securities trading at an appreciable discount from underlying value has a long history of delivering excellent investment results with very limited down side risk in this chapter i have used the word robust to extend the margin of safety concept to many other facets of a company we have sought a margin of safety on business quality by demanding high roce and a wide competitive moat on the strength of the balance sheet by requiring it to be debt free on the bargaining power of customers and suppliers by requiring them to be frag mented and on the sustainability of economics by insisting that the industry be slow changing but even these multiple levels of robustness or margins of safety can become compromised owing to unpredictable changes in the economy the industry or the company the covid 19 pandemic has severely impacted what had appeared to be highly robust hotel chains intel s erstwhile dominance in semiconductor chips has been upset by the likes of amd nvidia and samsung amazon has already destroyed many small and large retail businesses regulators in the united states and europe appear to be threatening the very existence of google and facebook in their current form we do the best we can to choose businesses based on their current and potential degree of robustness but bad things will happen we just don t know what when or how and so we turn to the one aspect of investing that is entirely within our control the price we pay we know that given the nature of the businesses we are after those with very low risk and exceptional business quality they will almost never be available cheap the market is not an idiot it is almost always efficient almost always not always we wait for those few occasions to pay what we call a fair price not too low but not too high either what is fair rather than describe it let me state the actual number the median trailing twelve month ttm entry pe ratio for the nalanda portfolio is 14 9 the median ttm pe for the period from 2005 to 2020 for india s primary index sensex is 19 7 and for the midcap index is 23 8 thus we are buying what we think are exceptional businesses at a 25 to 30 percent discount on the index over almost a quarter of a century of investing i know i have been wrong on many occasions the margin of safety of our entry price pays for my errors of judgment a leader is madea loser lazarus of bethany was miraculously brought back to life by jesus in the new testament 12 charles lazarus performed a modern capitalist miracle by making toys r us the largest and most well respected toy business globally lazarus is also a beggar ina parable in the gospel according to luke the third of the four gospels of the new testament once a miracle of lazarus toys r us suffered the same fate as lazarus the beggar charles lazarus opened his first toys r us store in 1957 12 in that era parents typically went to department stores to buy toys toy sales were seasonal and the six weeks leading up to christmas made up the bulk of sales for the year most toy stores were small family run shops and carried only a small number of toys having operated a baby furniture business from 1948 to 1957 and learned the shopping habits of parents lazarus decided to risk a new strategy he wanted to sell toys throughout the year and give parents and children a novel shopping experience his first store was 25 000 square feet in size and stocked thousands of toy varieties the store did not keep toys in display cases as did its competitors instead it kept them in rows next to each other like items ina grocery store the store was a massive hit given its size variety and low prices despite his initial success lazarus moved slowly at first and opened only four stores until 1966 in 1973 toys r us started advertising on tv using its store mascot a cuddly giraffe called geoffrey lazarus also began tapping japanese manufacturers to make inexpensive toys and negotiated attractive rates for bulk purchases the company went public in 1978 and grew at more than 20 percent annually for the next decade morgan stanley s retail analyst compared it to the venerable ibm in 1982 i think toys r us is a unique operation the only proprietary merchandise company that rivals ibm as revolutionary in concept the washington post compared it to another iconic american brand mcdonald s by declaring like mcdonald s with its regimented service and standardized burgers and fries toys r us has become an american institution toys r us kept gaining market share by opening stores slowly and steadily it did not get enticed by transformational mga although i am sure there was no dearth of bankers paying their respects to lazarus every week it continued however to take measured risks one of which was the opening of a kids r us clothing store in 1983 the company also started expanding overseas and in 1984 opened its first international stores in canada and singapore in 1985 the company opened five stores in the united kingdom and in 1991 they entered japan in an 80 20 joint venture with mcdonald s in the united kingdom toys r us captured a 9 percent market share in just three years the company continued to expand in overseas markets after its initial successes in 1988 the wall street journal boldly predicted toys r us big kid on the block won t stop growing as if on cue the problems started in 1988 walmart s market share at 17 4 percent came marginally ahead of that of toys r us at 16 8 percent toys r us was in second place after being the leader for fifteen years toys r us was being squeezed at both ends by discount chains like walmart target and costco which competed on low prices and by so called edutainment companies like zany brainy noodle kidoodle and imaginarium which offered higher priced specialized toys and better service in 1998 the company launched its website toysrus com and its first mail order catalog but the company was struggling and 1998 was the year of restructuring which is usually the euphemism for a business terminating its science projects and loss making initiatives the company announced a huge inventory reduction the closure of fifty nine stores in the united states france and germany the shuttering of thirty nine kids r us stores and a layoff of three thousand workers the cost of restruc turing was so high that the company declared its first net loss since going public too often a business in trouble tries to buy its way out toys r us was no exception it acquired imaginarium toy centers in 1998 it also tried frequent management changes the company had three ceos from 1994 to 2000 but its downward slide continued with amazon too muscling its way into the toy segment the company s sales stayed flat at 11 billion from 1997 to 2004 and the operating profit fell by about 65 percent during this period the operating roce was 15 percent in 1997 and it fell to 4 percent in 2004 the situation was so bad that the company shocked the world by announcing that it might completely with draw from the toy business and focus on the babies r us chain okay let s pause here and summarize the situation in 2005 toys r us was spectacularly successful for about four decades from the late 1950s to the late 1990s by the mid 2000s however it wasn t growing its market share was declining and its profitability had taken a severe beating whatever the reasons for its trouble there was no doubt that it was in trouble the company s robustness had suffered significantly maybe it was bad luck maybe it was management missteps or maybe it was a bit of both one way to think about this situation is to picture an elite marathoner whose performance has dipped in recent months they used to be a picture of health and vigor but nowadays they look exhausted and cannot run even ten kilometers at their ear lier marathon pace they are now at the starting line of the boston marathon what would you expect their coach to do before the race starts if i were the coach i would advise them to withdraw from the race rest and recover for a few months and slowly build their mileage back up maybe your advice would be different you might counsel them to take it easy and just finish the race with out worrying about a podium finish to minimize damage to the body i assume you would be shocked if i told you that the coach not only asked them to run at full speed but also loaded a ten pound bag on their back yet this is what happened to toys r us in 2005 the private equity giants kkr and bain and the real estate firm vornado purchased toys r us for 6 6 billion 22 however their equity contribution was only 1 3 billion and they borrowed 5 3 billion for this purchase and then they loaded this borrowing onto toys r us if you know nothing about the leveraged buyout lbo industry you may be rubbing your eyes in disbelief the private equity folks bought toys r us for a fat sum of money borrowed 80 percent of that amount and then burdened the company with this borrowing to finance their purchase oh yes welcome to the wonderful world of finance while leverage may be good from a corporate finance perspective it is bad from my point of view but i hope all parties can agree that it is terrible for a struggling business the elite but sick toys r us marathoner had just been asked to run the boston marathon competing with world class runners with a ten pound load on its back remember that the capitalist world is a boston marathon that never ends there is no respite at the end of a punishing two hour race the race goes on and on and on and on and on 24 hours x 7 days a week x 365 days a year it s unending unrelenting unforgiving the massive debt load meant that by 2007 97 percent of the company s operating profit was consumed by interest pay ments where was the money left to innovate invest in stores advertise hire and train the best people and do all the things any business needs to do to stay on top of their game in an atlantic article on the failure of toys r us 2 an interviewee remarks that the company was handcuffed and could not make investments another one rightly points out it s true that they could not respond to amazon but you have to ask yourself why katherine waldock a finance professor at georgetown university s mc donough school of business said in a wall street journal article the 400 million a year in debt service was really constrictive as they were trying to compete toys r us was already unrobust at multiple levels and the additional leverage taken by its private equity owners proved to be the last straw the company filed for bankruptcy in september 2017 and david brandon the ceo candidly admitted the company s overleveraged capital structure has constrained it from making necessary operational and capital expenditures includ ing investing in the revitalization of stores as a result the company has fallen behind some of its primary competitors on various fronts you don t say 2k toys r us bought the fao schwarz business in may 2009 both companies had been struggling against discount retailers and web based sellers like amazon most acquisitions compromise the buyer s robustness and for an already weakened company like toys r us the probability of success is even lower unsurprisingly it closed manhattan s iconic fao schwarz store in july 2015 22 and left me distraught dear amazon you have opened physical book shops in manhattan time for toys chapter summary evolutionary theory has taught me that we can reimagine investing by owning only robust businesses that are resilient to internal and external shocks while continu ing to evolve and grow 1 there is a paradox in the living world organic life is highly complex but not fragile organisms have survived hundreds of millions of years despite living in constantly changing external environments and undergoing a barrage of internal muta tions this is because they are robust at multiple levels 2 thus an accidental change in dna sequence does not affect which amino acids are made a change in amino acids or their sequence does not impact the synthesis of proteins and a change in proteins need not affect the body plan of an organism 3 neutral mutations permit new functions and adaptations to arise without disrupting current functioning 4 we want our businesses to mimic the robustness of the living world to survive and prosper in a dynamic external environ ment withstand internal strategic and organizational upheavals and evolve by taking calculated risks 5 hence we choose to invest only in businesses that are robust at multiple levels a robust business has high roce minimal or zero debt a strong competitive advantage fragmented customer and supplier bases a stable management team and is in a slow changing industry 6 just because a business is robust today does not mean it will continue to be so our only protection against the loss of robust ness of a business is to be price sensitive we do not invest unless the market offers us an attractive valuation which hap pens rarely chapter 4 the perils of a pavlovian as many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive and as consequently there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence it follows that any being if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life will have a better chance of surviving and thus be naturally selected charles darwin on the origin of species introduction inour view itis folly to forgo buying shares in an outstanding business whose long term future is predictable because of short term worries about an economy or a stock market that we know to be unpredictable why scrap an informed decision because of an uninformed guess warren buffett annual letter to shareholders 1994 ou are going bald not because of age but because you have been tearing your hair out a few months ago you committed to investing 100 000 with a money manager this fund manager did not want to raise cash and said that he would call commitments if he saw attractive opportunities to invest in the market he made a strong pitch with a snazzy powerpoint presentation and like everyone in the industry he promised to be long term oriented he also claimed that he does not like to lose money as if everyone else does and that he carefully assesses the quality of businesses and buys when everyone else is selling very buffettesque very old world you have heard the same spiel from every one but he seems quite sincere or at least he put on a good act a few quarters have passed and he has called 40 000 from you at the end of the quarter the value of your 40 000 invest ment is 38 000 you know that the market has been a bit weak lately so you ignore the minor loss you are a patient sort and don t fret over the value of your investments daily like many of your friends but when you check your investments next quarter you see that the value of your portfolio is now only 32 000 you have taken a hit of 15 percent in a single quarter to rub salt into your wounds the fund manager demands 15 000 more from you he is entitled to you have signed an agreement with him that commits you to keep investing until your 100 000 limit is reached you invest the additional 15 000 one more quarter goes by and you are aghast to discover that the value of your 55 000 is now only 39 000 you are down 30 percent within six months the fund manager repeats the same mantra we are long term patient blah blah blah while asking for an additional 15 000 you talk to some of your friends who appear to be stock market experts all of them advise you to stop investing more and to withdraw your remaining capital promptly unfortunately your lawyer advises you that there is no way out not only can you not redeem your capital because you have agreed to a lock up for many years but you must honor your commitment with great reluctance you invest an additional 15 000 your total investment is now 70 000 you have read buffett s great annual letters and listened to his interviews on tv you remember that he advises investors not to check their stock holdings obsessively hence this time you decide to wait six months before reviewing how your portfolio has performed kudos for your patience the day finally arrives you haven t felt this nervous since the first time you used a fake id to enter a bar you open your ac count statement with increasing dread your worst fears are realized your 70 000 investment has now almost halved to 36 000 your portfolio has lost about 40 percent during the past six months oh and your money manager is threatening to ask for more money apart from continuing to tear at your remaining hair what should you do the horns of dung beetles maybe they have the answer the how versus the why dung beetles love poop duh with about eight thousand species this cleanup crew of the insect world eats poop they build their nests with poop live in those nests and lay their eggs in them to sustain their larvae check out figure 4 1 for a small sample of the astonishing variety of dung beetles among insects they have the unique distinction of caring for their young dad provides food and mom tends to the nest  4 1a f the impressive variety of dung beetles source licensed from istockphoto getty images many years ago while taking a poop in the open in masai mara in kenya don t ask i heard them before i saw them they scurry noisily at a surprisingly brisk pace the males have impressive looking horns and the eight thousand species have almost as many different kinds of horns their shape resembles rhinoceros horns elephant tusks deer antlers and even a serrated knife their size varies from very small to massive some are even larger than the entire dung beetle s body what explains these horns one way evolutionary biologists describe them is through hormonal developmental and genetic mechanisms for example a 2019 science article provides evidence that dung beetles use wing genes to grow their horns 2 the wing genes get turned on in the early stages of the growth of the horns later these genes switch off and a new set of genes grows and shapes the horns an article in the journal of insect physiology explores the types and quantities of hormones that con trol the length of horns in males 3 it showed that the hormone methoprene has a significant influence on the production of horns these scientists are asking how questions how do the horns grow how does horn length differ another route of exploring the cause of horns is to understand the adaptive nature of them these are why questions why did horns arise why do they increase the fitness of the beetle why can horns be considered an adaptation the selectionist explanation contends that the horns of male dung beetles allow the bearer to garner more resources defend their nests and com pete for the best females thereby reproducing more than the males without horns for example an article in the journal of insect behavior describes an experiment providing evidence that males with larger horns get preferential access to females and thus can be considered adaptive the same article also describes the adaptive value of small horns in some males these males have greater mobility and can sneak around the larger males to mate with the females the first category of explanations for the dung beetle s horns addressing the how question are called proximate causes and the second addressing the why question are ultimate causes proximate mechanisms explore immediate physical influ ences on a trait the history of the organism determines ultimate causes specifically the role played by natural selection to favor one trait versus another to elaborate further let s talk about sex or more precisely polyandry in the predatory mite species neoseiulus californicus 4 polyandry implies multiple matings by the female of a species and is the opposite of polygyny wherein a male succeeds in mating with multiple females bateman s prin ciple named after an english geneticist argues for the prevalence of polygyny in the animal kingdom he contended that since females invest much more in offspring than do males they are the limiting factor over which males compete leading to polygyny however polyandry is more widespread than bateman believed in many species females are not just waiting around to get im pregnated they are actively scouting for multiple partners and one of these species is the mite n californicus but what drives this mite to become polyandrous when the dominant trend in the animal world is toward polygyny peter schausberger and his colleagues tackled this question in a plos one article and they came up with two different sets of explana tions one proximate and one ultimate the scientists discovered that the ultimate cause of polyandry in n californicus consists of both direct and indirect fitness benefits females that mated multiple times produced more offspring than females that mated just once and these offspring also survived longer as for the proximate cause the authors identified a key one first mating duration if the females first mating period was below a certain threshold 150 minutes the likelihood of their continuing to seek male partners increased the imme diate cause of females seeking more sex was a lack of sex who says science is boring ernst mayr one of the greatest evolutionary biologists of the twentieth century proposed the proximate ultimate duality in a landmark article titled cause and effect in biology in the journal science in 1961 5 using the example of bird migration he posed the following question why did the warbler on my summer place in new hampshire start his southward migration on the night of the 25th of august he proposed four causes for this migration first an ecological cause the bird would starve if it stayed in new hampshire for the winter second a genetic cause honed over mil lions of years that induced the warbler to respond to external stimuli and gain selective advantage over warblers that did not migrate third an internal physiological cause that propelled the bird to leave once the number of daylight hours dropped below acertain level and last an external physiological cause that was reflected in a sudden drop in temperature on august 25 the warbler was already physiologically ready for migration and this sudden cold wave made it leave that day mayr called the first two explanations ultimate causes and the latter two proximate causes problems of proximate focus among all the philosophical issues that we have imbibed from evolutionary biology recognizing the difference between proximate and ultimate causes is right on top we want the businesses we own to increase in value over the long run and the only way for this to happen is for the com pany to perform well over many years preferably decades investment success may not correlate with business success for a day trader or short term investor but for us the ultimate success of an investment is almost entirely dependent on the ultimate suc cess of the business if you accept this premise then as permanent owners we should focus exclusively on the quality and performance of the business over the long run and that is what we do however this is easier said than done in today s world of facebook instagram reddit twitter whatsapp and other soul destroying inventions it is not easy to escape the din of proximate noise that can drown out the desire to seek sources of ultimate success when there is a specter of a greek default an announcement of reduced jobs growth in the united states opec negotia

on world growth the recapitalization of banks in china the success of a new product launch or the increased pace of vaccination for a global pandemic can lead to higher stock prices all these are proximate causes of price movement and all are divorced from what could ultimately lead to the business success or failure and hence a higher or lower market value of a company the question we investors don t ask often enough but should is relatively straightforward does this proximate cause have anything to do with the cause of ultimate business success the interesting thing about proximate causes is that they are almost always evident in screaming newspaper headlines and hyperventilating news anchors ultimate causes thankfully are way too dull for media coverage why thankfully i will get to it the sections that follow describe four categories of proximate causes of share price gyrations macroeconomic market related thematic and company specific factors this list is not exhaustive there are way too many to count but after reading this thope you will be able to spot a proximate cause when you encounter it proximate macroeconomic causes we live in an uncertain world but it s actually worse than that we live in an uncertain hyperconnected world on balance hy perconnectedness has benefited humanity i get to eat norwegian salmon in singapore my use of the adjective worse here is limited to the impact of hyperconnectedness on my community that is fund managers before i became an investor in 1998 if someone had told me that inflation or u s employment data would affect the stock price of a paint company in india i would have concluded that that person had no idea what they were talking about but this is precisely what happens on october 27 1997 the dow jones industrial average suffered one of its largest single day drops in history it fell 554 points or 7 2 percent for the first time in its history the new york stock exchange halted trading all major world markets were affected hong kong s hang seng fell 6 percent the united kingdom s ftse fell 6 percent the australian market fell 7 percent and germany s dax fell almost 6 percent in short if you were looking for a definition of financial panic your search would have ended here the proximate cause of this mayhem the spreading of the asian financial crisis it had all started on july 2 1997 when the thai government floated the baht since it did not have the foreign currency to support the baht s peg to the u s dollar the curren cies of indonesia south korea malaysia and the philippines also suffered precipitous declines many companies in these countries had borrowings in dollars and these firms started defaulting on their payments table 4 1 tracks the u s and uk market indices at the time along with the stock prices of a few well known businesses the u s market decline is for october 27 monday relative to october 24 friday the uk market reacts to the u s market s movement with a day s delay owing to time difference thus the uk market data is for october 28 tuesday relative to october 24 friday table 4 1 u s and uk market indices after october 27 1997 index october 27 28 1997 after 6 months u s market dow 7 25 wal mart 6 57 citigroup 11 7 boeing 11 16 microsoft 5 35 exxon 7 26 uk market ftse 250 6 23 bp 5 14 rolls royce 4 29 diageo 7 50 unilever 8 40 hsbc 7 23 every number in the first column is negative why why did wal mart a local u s business and boeing a global enterprise fall on october 27 and why did thai bond defaults impact unilever which earned about 70 percent of its revenue and profits from the developed world in 1997 and bp a global oil company proximate paranoia confused with ultimate reality the evidence is in the second column which provides the index levels and stock prices six months after october 27 1997 the dow as well as the ftse were up 25 percent and the dramatic upward movement of companies like wal mart diageo and unilever may have led to the firing of some fund managers who had pressed the panic button on october 27 if you want to lash out at the fund management community for being impulsive and trigger happy go ahead but please don t blame us for being inconsistent whenever the markets get excited about a macroeconomic event the fund managers behave predictably by riding the proximate bandwagon of stock prices and then they repent at leisure fund managers have a pavlovian reaction to macro or market data will interest rates be higher sell will inflation be lower buy if the fiscal deficit shoots up sell or is it a buy most businesses should be and are relatively immune to short term macro movements as shown in table 4 1 their stock prices for some inexplicable reasons are not some argue that for certain types of businesses say banks or financial companies that rely on lending and deposit taking interest rates should significantly impact long term performance hence interest rate movements should be proximate and ultimate causes of business performance let s look at the following data of stock price changes for three large indian banks over twenty years from december 31 1999 to december 31 2019 hdfc bank 81x icici bank 33x state bank of india 16x during these two decades the reserve bank of india had increased or decreased interest rates more than fifty times 2 rates varied between 5 percent and 12 percent with wild gyrations in between more importantly all these banks were subject to the same regime of interest rates and other macro factors if you were an hdfc bank shareholder did it matter what the interest rate was or at what pace the reserve bank of india changed it hdfc bank s business and therefore its stock price did spectacularly well because of its ceo aditya puri one of the most outstanding leaders in indian corporate history in october 2020 the economist called him the best banker in the world in terest rates current account deficits exchange rates and other such esoteric measures did not get in the way of puri achieving excellence iam not cherry picking here over the long run well run businesses create a lot of value irrespective of the macroeconomic environment do we seriously think amazon jpmorgan michelin nestlé siemens tesco walmart zara and other excellent busi nesses are held hostage to inflation and fiscal deficit if the business and stock price performance of exceptional companies is im mune to macroeconomic perturbations aren t we as investors in those companies better off ignoring the economy there is another big problem with considering macroeconomic data while analyzing individual businesses let s confront this headache through the example of tires there are many listed tire businesses in india so it should be a happy hunting ground for us let s say the world bank announces that india will grow its gdp by 8 percent next year this seems like good news for the country what about tires someone could argue that gdp growth will lead to an increase in personal wealth which would lead to consumers buying more cars and hence more tires should we buy a tire business then but wait a sales increase is not the same as a profit increase the primary raw material for tire companies is rubber which accounts for about 60 percent of revenue what if rubber prices shoot up in anticipation that indian tire businesses will need to buy more rubber next year this is getting way too complicated you need a number crunching analyst with a lot of computing power at their disposal your super smart analyst builds their 100 gigabyte excel model after burning the midnight oil for a couple weeks and predicts that rubber prices will be benign whew should we buy a tire business now hold on how do we know what strategy or tactics the dozen or so tire companies will employ in a favorable environment what if one of the smaller companies decides to wage a price war to shore up market share some have done so in the past or what if the dominant player increases its advertising budget significantly by sponsoring international cricket tournaments let s assume the same astute analyst predicts that no company will misbehave this analyst is brilliant ok are we ready to invest now not at all how are we to know the relative growth of various tire segments that will ultimately impact overall industry profits the truck segment is the largest and the least profitable whereas two wheeler tires are the most profitable but generate only a tiny fraction of industry revenue thus if the truck tire segment grows faster than the rest of the tire market the profits of tire companies may decline you ask the analyst to forecast segmental growth after they have come up with the answer again you go back to the drawing board and now you are perturbed by an uncomfortable realization since tires are highly capital intensive they can sig nificantly impact the debt level of a business which could affect its robustness and the stock price how are you to predict which tire company will invest and how much i know back to our resourceful analyst i could go on and on but it gets worse or better if you are that smart analyst on overtime pay note that in the tire example ihave tried to predict the performance of a business by analyzing only gdp growth but macroeconomic data encompass a much more comprehensive range of indicators such as employment level exchange rate inflation government deficit money supply current account balance and many more how can we assess all these factors in the context of a tire business and fund managers don t invest only in tires are we supposed to repeat this mega exercise across the dozens of industries and hundreds of companies we track also given the connectedness of the global economy should we also incorporate the macroeconomic data of other coun tries into our decision making are we ready to give up now we have seen two problems with treating macroeconomic factors as critical proximate variables first we noticed that even big macro events like the asian financial crisis are uncorrelated with longer term stock price performance second taking the ex ample of the indian tire industry we concluded that using proximate economic data to assess industry and company performance is very hard if not impossible the third problem with using economic data is the most obvious of all no one knows anything okay that is exaggerating a bit but only a bit since even expert economists are abysmal at forecasting the economy why should we investors squander our time giving it any importance iassume you will agree that an economist s most important task is to forecast a recession this would enable the govern ment to take the necessary steps to prevent widespread pain and suffering in march 2018 the imf published a working paper titled how well do economists forecast recessions 2 the authors compared real gdp forecasts with actual growth data for sixty three countries from 1992 to 2014 they showed that while gdp contracted by an average of 2 8 percentage points during recessions the consensus forecast from the year before the recession was a growth of 3 percent worse even during the year of the recession the average forecast was a contraction of 0 8 percent when the real contraction turned out to be 2 8 percent prakash loungani one of the authors of this imf paper told the guardian in an interview that according to his analysis economists had failed to predict 148 of the last 150 recessions the record of failure to predict recessions is virtually unblem ished he said one would have thought that with a greater volume of data more computing power and better algorithms our ability to forecast would have improved over the years yeah right in the same guardian article mark pearson the deputy director for employment labour and social affairs at the organisation for economic co operation and development in paris said we are getting worse at making forecasts because the world is getting more complicated way to go mark i know that many investors spend a lot of time poring over economic data maybe they have figured out a way to factor in exchange rate movement or the external debt levels of the country in their decision making i am unable to do so i do not know how to translate any economic indicator into the prospects of a specific business we ignore every piece of proximate macroeconomic information we do not believe these data help us assess the ultimate success or failure of a business we have no economic advisers we do not talk to economists at banks or brokerage houses and we do not discuss any economic indicators in our team meetings their weightage in our investment decision is a big zero proximate market related causes i don t fraternize with folks in the financial services industry to exchange ideas or information however when i started my investing career with warburg pincus in 1998 i spent a fair bit of time with fund managers and finance professionals connected with the indian equity markets i had a consulting background and wanted to understand the workings of the capital market and its participants i thought i had a lot to learn i was right just not in the way i had imagined after just a couple months at warburg i could predict the exact words of a finance industry professional s greeting it wasn t how are you or how s it going or just hello it would almost always be kya lagta hai translated from hindi in stock market parlance this means what do you think the market will do i remember being confused here i was a novice trying to understand how the markets work while this expert was seeking my opinion do they not know it took me a while to conclude that they don t no one does the previous section explained market decline owing to a proximate macroeconomic problem the asian financial crisis maybe you did not notice my sleight of hand i claimed to know the cause of market correction the fact is that i do not know why the markets corrected but it looked like the crumbling of asian currencies played a role i had established a connection between the market movement and economic data however spurious that connection may have been but there are many other occasions when the market moves because well it moves such is the nature of markets the proximate causes of market movements are unknown and in my view unknowable let s go back to july 24 2002 the dow soared 489 points the second best point gain ever and the best percentage gain since 1987 12 the reason even after reading many news articles i am not sure anyway according to various media sources the rally was the result of congressional negotiators reaching some kind of an agreement on corporate fraud also some executives who had been defrauding the cable company adelphia were arrested whatever let s now look at table 4 2 on markets and how stock prices in the united states and the united kingdom reacted to this great news table 4 2 u s and uk market indices after july 24 2002 index july 24 25 2002 after 6 months u s market dow 6 2 wal mart 6 2 citigroup 10 16 boeing 6 26 microsoft 7 11 exxon 10 1 uk market ftse 250 1 5 14 bp 6 18 rolls royce 2 31 diageo 9 15 unilever 7 6 hsbc 2 7 as you can see over the following six months the dow in the u s shrugged off the gains of july 24 2002 and declined by 2 percent the significant upward moves in the share prices of large companies like wal mart citigroup and boeing could not keep pace with the euphoria of this one day boeing declined by a fourth over the next six months even more remarkable is the behavior of the markets in the united kingdom you would have thought that the so called corruption investigations in the united states should not affect the uk markets well we fund managers never cease to amaze the ftse 250 went up by 1 5 percent the day after the u s markets moved up 6 percent and the stock prices of large companies as shown in the first column of table 4 2 shot up by 2 to 9 percent these are not small moves for companies with large market values the euphoria did not last just six months after the event rolls royce was down by almost a third and bp and diageo had declined by 15 percent or more why did fund managers in the united kingdom start piling on to bp rolls royce and diageo on july 25 after a huge increase in the u s indices on july 24 the explanation that comes to mind was offered by the great john maynard keynes when he opined that the stock market players were playing a complex guessing game 1 he asked us to imagine a game in which competitors pick the six prettiest faces from one hundred photographs the winner is not the one who picks the prettiest faces but whose choices match the average of all the competitors how would you play a game like this my approach would be to not choose the six prettiest faces and instead spend my time guessing which six the other players will select before i were to start feeling smug about my second level strategy i would realize that a more insightful competitor would go a step further to a third level they would try to guess what the average opinion ex pects the average beauty to be and so on to even higher levels keynes had learned from bitter experience that this market guessing game is a colossal waste of time in the 1920s he used a detailed economic model to predict market levels and failed to see the great crash of 1929 he also underperformed the market during this period he switched to picking stocks and like buffett eschewed diversification he declared the right method of in vestment is to put fairly large sums of money into enterprises one thinks one knows something about no wonder he turned out to be an excellent investor keynes managed the endowment of king s college cambridge from 1924 to 1946 during this twenty two year period he compounded the college s wealth by almost 14 percent a year if someone had invested 100 with keynes at the start of 1924 it would have been worth about 1 675 at the time of his death in 1946 the same money invested in the uk stock market index would have been worth only 424 astonishingly this period included the great crash of 1929 the great depression and the second world war should the financial world not have absorbed keynes s insights ha december 2019 looked like any other december and the wall street stock market strategists were at it again forecasting market growth for 2020 since the year 2000 the median wall street forecast has never predicted a stock market decline in the next year yes you read that right not once did the forecasters believe that the stock market could go down the reality the mar ket fell on six occasions the median forecasts from the year 2000 to 2020 missed the actual number by 12 9 percent points more than double the average annual increase of 6 percent over these years back to december 2019 remember that no one was aware of the covid 19 pandemic then the median consensus among the forecasters was that the market would rise by 2 7 percent in 2020 2 if the forecasters had known then that a pandemic would rage across the world from march 2020 until december 2020 what do you think their forecast for 2020 would have been we will never know but i bet they would have predicted a huge fall in the market in any event the s p 500 rose by 16 3 percentage points in 2020 but 2020 s pandemic was a once in a century event and we should not hold it against the forecasters that they were wrong by 13 6 percentage points fair enough what if we assess the forecast of an acknowledged master forecaster from early may 2020 only eight months of the year remain the pandemic has been raging for four months and the dire impact on the economy seems quite evident i would think that an expert could go wrong at this stage but probably not by much harry s dent jr called by some the contrarian s contrarian accurately predicted japan s economic collapse the dot com bust in 2000 and the election of donald trump 2 after receiving his mba from harvard business school he joined bain com pany and now runs an independent research firm he is a regular guest on cnbc cnn fox fox business good morning america and pbs he has also been featured in barron s fortune business week the wall street journal and many other publications he also publishes a monthly newsletter called the hs dent forecast in short dent embodies as much expertise as an expert can muster in early may 2020 in an interview with thinkadvisor dent predicted that the market would peak in august 2020 and that investors might be able to make a return of 5 to 10 percent he advised them to get out and counseled against buying how wrong was he the market kept rising until december 31 and from the time of dent s interview in early may the s p 500 rose 32 percent even if you take the highest number of 10 percent returns in dent s band that is an error of 22 percentage points over eight months or an annualized error of 33 percent oops before you blame me for choosing a forecaster who turned out to be egregiously wrong i challenge you to find me an expert who asserted in may 2020 that the market would be up by 25 to 30 percent by the end of december i could not find one trust me itried to be fair i have not met a single finance professional who claims that markets can be predicted so why do industry players spend so much time obsessing over future market levels why do fund managers devote enormous time and effort obsessing over what other fund managers think and do flawed incentives false comfort one upmanship you name it it doesn t really matter we ignore all market forecasts well maybe not entirely i do look at them on days when i want to have a good laugh proximate thematic causes at the end of annus horribilis 2020 i realized i was wrong by 6 billion in early september 2020 nikola was a stock market darling the start up had listed barely a year earlier at a valuation of 4 billion its value had since quintupled to almost 20 billion led by its charismatic founder trevor milton who was often compared to elon musk nikola was planning to develop semitrucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells and batteries it had just an nounced a partnership with gm wherein the detroit giant would get an 11 percent stake for 2 billion in return for a contract to engineer and build nikola s semitrucks on september 10 2020 a reputed investment fund and short seller called hindenburg research published a scathing report titled nikola how to parlay an ocean of lies into a partnership with the largest auto oem in america the first line of the report states that nikola was an intricate fraud built on dozens of lies over the course of its founder and executive chairman trevor mil ton s career 14 in 2017 to prove that its technology worked nikola shared a video titled nikola one in motion which showed its proto type semitruck speeding along a road hindenburg claimed that the company had simply towed an ordinary truck to the top of a hill in a remote area and had filmed it rolling down the hill after the report was published nikola felt compelled to acknowledge this fact by stating nikola never stated its truck was driving under its own propulsion in the video what what else was a speeding truck supposed to show the road the revelation of this bare faced lie was just the start of the lengthy report hindenburg s research unearthed several more problems nikola did not have a battery technology despite milton s claims to the contrary it did not possess hydrogen fuel cell expertise milton had a history of taking technology from others and then claiming it as his own milton also had a track record of troubled partnerships that ended in failure lawsuits and recriminations and milton had claimed that nikola s corporate head quarters were completely off grid and used 3 5 megawatt solar panels though no headquarters existed i could list many more damning assertions made by hindenburg in its lengthy report but suffice to say that the future seemed bleak for nikola trevor milton resigned within a few days of the report and gm ended its partnership discussions with the company the securities and exchange commission and the department of justice launched their own investigations unsurprisingly the stock price started crashing here is my question for you what do you think nikola s market value was at the end of december 2020 three months after the hindenburg exposé remember that the company had no battery or fuel cell technology had no prototype its founder had exited ignominiously gm had terminated the partnership and the government had begun investigating fraud my answer would be close to zero nope it was 6 billion the hindenburg report appeared to be fact based they backed up almost all their assertions with documents photographs text messages videos and interviews i am in no position to double check their research however the facts that milton resigned and gm terminated the partnership seem to indicate that a reasonable portion if not all of the report was credible if so how does one explain a 6 billion valuation for a company like nikola that s an unfair question because i doubt anyone fully under stands how companies are valued but in this case i want to offer a two word answer thematic investing the theme being new age automotive companies will rule the world automotive tech start ups have been a rage since 2020 15 according to an article in the financial times in january 2021 these companies had amassed a market value of 60 billion but most had not generated a single dollar of revenue and why didn t they have any revenue because like nikola they didn t even have a product the popular saying fact is stranger than fiction is tailor made for the valuation of new age automotive start ups the ft article names nine listed start ups the largest of which was quantumscape valued at 19 billion this company projects its first revenue of 14 million in 2024 in 2028 just four years after generating its first revenue the company expects to touch 10 billion revenue as a matter of comparison after recording its first revenue in 2008 tesla took nine years to cross 10 billion and remember that tesla had the lion s share of the market in those years the quantumscape website proclaims that the company s mission is to revolutionize energy storage to enable a sustainable future its investors range from blue blooded ven ture capital firms like kleiner perkins and lightspeed to car companies like volkswagen and saic and there were many others hyliion s market value was 2 6 billion and it was planning to manufacture hybrid trucks velodyne lidar 3 9 billion sensing solutions for autonomous vehicles fisker 4 1 billion electric cars luminar technologies 10 1 billion object detection technology canoo 4 billion electric vehicles you get the picture a foolproof method of checking the interest level in a concept or theme is to analyze google searches using google trends if you do so for the term electric vehicles between january 2014 and january 2019 in the united states you will see a relatively flat trend however between january 2019 and february 2021 interest in electric vehicles quadrupled now check out the dates the companies just mentioned went public nikola june 2020 velodyne lidar september 2020 fisker october 2020 hyliion october 2020 quantumscape november 2020 canoo december 2020 luminar december 2020 idon t know if the ipos of these companies increased the interest level in the search term or whether the increased searches of electric vehicles were a leading indicator of public listings maybe they just fed each other in a positive feedback loop what ever the case may be as you can see there is a strong correlation between the theme of electric vehicles and the ipos of these busi nesses a classic example of a strong proximate mechanism at work in addition in january 2021 there were at least eight to ten more private start ups ready to go public all with obvious sounding names like chargepoint evgo lightning emotors lion electric and motiv power systems if the market value of the listed companies holds i bet that in the next few years there will be dozens more listed companies with this theme these companies valued at billions with not even millions in revenue epitomize investment strategies based on proximate themes like almost every proximate theme before and since the automotive tech theme has three properties it hypes up total ad dressable market tam is simple to understand and is actionable first tam every theme i have encountered since the start of my investing career in 1998 plays on the enormous size of the addressable market and the size is usually so large that it dwarfs the businesses currently operating in that industry or theme no wonder it is usually the most salient proximate cause of a theme gone wild in march 2021 a ubs report touted the zero emission trucking market as potentially 1 5 trillion in size and current man ufacturers and start ups raced to grab dominance tesla which did not manufacture trucks in march 2021 had revenue of only 32 billion in 2020 in my experience there is only one problem with chasing a proximate theme based on tam it s useless it makes astrology based forecasts look respectable tam is pointless because it does not tell us whether any profits will be made and even if a busi ness can be profitable tam is silent on who will make that moolah one of the largest tams is that of apparel and footwear the u s market for apparel and footwear is about 370 billion itis also one of the hardest places to make money the lack of robustness of this industry was also evident during the pandemic when scores of apparel and footwear companies declared bankruptcies brooks brothers centric brands century 21 g star jcpenney j crew john varvatos neiman marcus tailored brands and many more someone forgot to tell these companies that their tam would save them even prepandemic most apparel brands struggled to grow and make a decent income take the example of a well known brand like gap it hasn t grown in the united states since 2007 with sales almost flat at 15 to 16 billion and it achieved its peak net income of 1 3 billion back in 2014 guess s revenue fluctuated between 2 billion to 2 6 billion between 2009 and 2020 and its roce hasn t crossed 10 percent since 2016 abercrombie fitch s revenue in 2006 was 3 3 billion and it grew to only 3 6 bil lion by 2019 it too has not earned more than 10 percent roce since 2014 the global market for apparel and footwear is about 1 9 trillion a colossal tam but the only apparel companies that seem to consistently grow their sales and churn profits are h m uniqlo and zara other industries like airlines restaurants infrastruc ture banking and retailing are the same their tams are quite high but most industry players don t make any money so what use is tam to a long term investor the second reason for the seductiveness of a proximate theme is its simplicity even a casual reader of business news will be aware of themes like e commerce renewable energy electric vehicles fintech food delivery artificial intelligence self driving cars infrastructure and biotech unlike economic forecasting which is full of jargon like gdp and monetary supply a layper son can relate to themes anyone can understand what renewable energy is and that the country needs a lot more infrastructure investment for the automotive tech start ups the simple argument goes as follows electric and autonomous vehicles will con quer the world and since tesla s market value is 700 billion shouldn t this theme capture trillions of dollars of value in the near future and if so why shouldn t a start up be valued at billions of dollars the premise is seductive because it is straightforward third it is actionable if you believe in the theme that consumers will order more food sitting at home because it is cheaper and easier than dining out you can invest in doordash or deliveroo are you interested in an electric vehicle company with actual revenues hail tesla do you believe in the providers of technology rather than the car velodyne lidar beckons do you think trucks are a bigger opportunity nikola is pining for you why does it matter that its founder was probably a charlatan i don t know where the theme of automotive start ups will end up in 2025 or 2030 what i do know based on the history of capital markets and new age technologies like railways and the internet is that this theme will face its comeuppance someday many readers will not fondly remember the theme ascendant in the early 2000s that home prices will rise forever any bank or financial company riding this theme was rewarded with increasing stock prices now we know that home prices don t keep rising and pricier homes bought with heavy borrowing need to fall in price only slightly for panic to set in no one investing in the theme homes are an unbeatable investment could have imagined that the following marquee names would go bankrupt or need a huge bailout lehman assets of 691 billion washington mutual 328 billion cit group 80 billion thornburg mort gage 39 billion general growth properties 30 billion and several more the indian market is no different at various times since the start of my investing career in 1998 i have witnessed the following themes create and then destroy billions of dollars of value in the capital markets real estate infrastructure education microfinance consumer lending and technology services in addition until early 2022 on paper the following themes have cre ated but not yet destroyed a lot of value in indian private markets edtech fintech e commerce software as a service saas lo gistics and social media based on history many of these concepts will crater i just don t know which ones or when how should we separate the proximate causes from the ultimate ones when there is euphoria or bearishness in a theme unfortunately i am not aware of a foolproof method for doing so but here is what we do we define our unit of analysis clearly as the company not the economy not the market not a theme we care about the fun damentals of the company nothing else we have never invested in a theme and never will again just to be clear iam not implying that thematic investing is flawed maybe some fund managers can do it success fully we would if we could but we can t so we won t proximate company specific causes in december 2016 after almost three years of vaibhav global s continuous underperformance for the first time we actively de bated whether we should exit entirely were we confusing an ultimate cause for a proximate one vaibhav is a retailer of low priced jewelry and other accessories in the united states and the united kingdom that sells through tv and the internet one can shop at https www shoplc com in the united states or https www tjc co uk in the united kingdom please do you will find its deals unbeatable vaibhav competes primarily with home shopping giants like qvc and hsn as well as hundreds of other online and offline retailers we invested in vaibhav in late 2007 after underwhelming performance for a few years the company grew its revenue and operating profit at an annualized rate of about 30 percent from the year ended march 2011 to 2014 in july 2014 the stock price hit an all time high of inr 174 our buy price was inr 48 sunil agarwal the founder and ceo had done a stellar job in recent years however from april 2014 the company s sales and profits started falling primarily owing to three self inflicted missteps first vaibhav did not respond to a significant strategic move by competition in the united states every major competitor of vaib hav had started offering customers an option to pay in installments however vaibhav refused to follow in their footsteps sunil did not want to take an unnecessary financial risk also vaibhav s average sale price is only about 20 to 25 per piece compared to 50 to 100 for competition sunil thought that customers would not care about installments if they got a quality product at a low enough price it turns out that they did second the company faltered in designing and implementing a robust technology platform the company lagged behind all its peers on the quality of its customer facing websites and apps even some of its back end technology platforms e g which helped decide which products to merchandise when were outdated and inflexible vaibhav s internet sales accounted for 16 per cent of company revenue whereas this number was 51 percent for qvc the company fired its head of technology but the new leader was taking time to fix the problems last vaibhav lost a few key senior managers sunil had fired some of them but some had left for greener pastures he was also finding it hard to attract quality talent to fill the vacancies from the year ended march 2014 to march 2016 sales fell by 2 percent but profits declined by almost 70 percent roce collapsed from 55 percent in 2014 to 13 percent in 2016 the stock market had reacted appropriately vaibhav s stock price was inr 54 in december 2016 a fall of almost 70 percent from its previous peak in july 2014 we were now in a dilemma were these problems a delay in responding to competition the lack of a robust technology platform a paucity of senior leaders proximate causes of stock price decline or did these headaches reflect a more fundamental and long term issue with the company were these issues fixable or should we abandon any hope of revival we are permanent owners in businesses and do not sell unless there is irreparable damage to a business were these lapses temporary or would the company be able to overcome this adversity as ihave discussed in this chapter we ignore proximate problems related to the economy the market and even the industry but the dilemma is much trickier to address when the proximate cause of problems relates to the company itself suppose the sales growth and profitability of the company has declined in the past few quarters whereas its main competitors showed no such struggle how would you decide if the performance issues are related to proximate and hence temporary causes or ultimate and hence more permanent causes in my experience developing a method and an instinct to separate proximate and ultimate causes of failure or success when they relate to a company event is invaluable for a long term investor i have been an investor for more than two decades and this is where i stumble most often as usual at the extremes the decision is straightforward if the share price declines owing to a downturn in one or two quarters we ignore the decline consider ing it a proximate event but if the decline results from a loss of market share for three years in a row we ask if there is something fundamentally wrong with the business it is the gray area in between these extremes that creates the worst headaches for us i do not know of any foolproof method of cracking the conundrum the answer is almost always very company specific vaibhav was in this gray zone maybe the proximate issues indicated ultimate problems but maybe they didn t we decided to stay with the business under sunil s leadership the company had performed exceedingly well until only three years earlier and nothing had changed in the market since then there were no new entrants and customer behavior re mained the same more importantly vaibhav s competitive position of selling jewelry and accessories in the range of 20 to 25 remained intact even during the difficult years none of its competitors was able or willing to match vaibhav s value proposition also as time passed we saw sunil taking timely steps to address the issues late in 2014 he started offering installment plans which put a stop to customer attrition despite declining profits he invested aggressively in building the technology team and infrastructure finally as he promoted some internal staff to leadership positions instead of hiring from outside we could discern some early signs of progress luckily for us sunil and his team did turn the business around sales grew by 11 percent annually from the year ended march 2016 to 2020 but more impressively operating profits grew almost five fold roce jumped from 13 percent to 45 percent during this period and the annual free cash flow almost quadrupled the stock price jumped six and a half fold from inr 54 in december 2016 to inr 352 in september 2022 vaibhav may have turned out well for us for now but this was a touch and go decision it could have gone either way our instinct to stay in business as permanent owners helped us stay the course most importantly we got very lucky the pain and the gain of headline harassment let s go back to the question i raised at the beginning of the chapter you have sunk 70 000 in a fund that is now worth 36 000 everything the fund manager touches seems to be heading down apart from continuing to tear your hair out what should you do nothing at the end of the anecdote the time was march 2009 if you had done nothing and continued to hold the fund your 36 000 would be worth a little more than 770 000 at the end of september 2022 which is a multiple of 21 4 times over 13 5 years in comparison the main stock index grew six fold during these years as you may have guessed this was not a hypothetical situation i have described what transpired at nalanda what you see in the numbers i ve given is the result of our aggressive buying during the global financial crisis of 2008 and its dramatic longer term impact on the fund s performance the only change you would need to make is to switch dollars to rupees 12 your patience would have paid a lot as the indian market started falling from march 2008 we started buying high quality businesses and we did not stop until early 2009 the further the market fell the greater our buying frenzy was in december 2008 the fund had delivered an annual ized return called the internal rate of return or irr in investing parlance of 55 percent and we continued to invest as much as we could the fund s annualized rupee return as of september 2022 was 20 3 percent after payment of all fees and expenses what allowed us to invest when the world seemed to be coming to an end we ignored all proximate causes of stock price decline and focused exclusively on the ultimate sources of success of a business let s walk through an example our most successful investment to date is page industries in october 2008 the company had a stellar track record of perfor mance over more than a decade and was the number one innerwear brand in the country it had overtaken competitors that had started many decades before it entered india in 1995 over the previous five years the company had grown revenue at 32 percent per year and had earned 57 percent roce on october 7 2008 three weeks after lehman s collapse we bought 8 percent of the company for inr 455 per share this was a 23 percent premium to the prevailing stock price of inr 370 per share we took a notional loss the very next day after our purchase in fact the stock price did not cross our buy price for six months until april 2009 at the end of july 2022 page was at inr 48 873 a multiple of 107 times our buy price during this period the sensex went up 5 5 times our view on page and seven other businesses we bought during the financial crisis was that global events may affect the stock prices of high quality companies but not their business strength the fact that investors were dumping stocks was not a prob lem but an opportunity businesses market valuations may take a hit but not their intrinsic value the opportunity cost of not in vesting in troubled times far exceeds any near term pain owing to notional losses our success with page is only partly the result of our aggression at a time of market panic it is largely the result of our unwillingness to sell a great business at any price but more on that later the title of section ii of this book is buy high quality at a fair price this is a nice sounding strategy but far from easy to implement in practice the problem is that high quality businesses are seldom available at a fair price markets are very efficient most of the time however when proximate causes get divorced from ultimate ones markets can offer even great businesses at a fair price we took full advantage of this temporary insanity to wade in all guns blazing our trailing twelve month ttm pe mul tiple for buying page 18 times can you believe it this undeserved luck was the direct result of what i call headline harassment while we were busy buying stellar busi nesses in 2008 and early 2009 the following headlines and others like them appeared in the most widely read indian business daily the economic times 8 mark to market losses worry india inc july 18 2008 economic activity is slowing down fast august 25 2008 financial crisi are mnc jobs secure september 26 2008 sensex nifty hit new 2008 lows october 16 2008 economic recession lay offs shift balance of power november 15 2008 why did sensex crash from 20k to 10k december 20 2008 it is common knowledge that lousy news attracts way more eyeballs than good news 2 we may blame the media for this bias but psychologists have shown that people prefer reading bad news and remember it better the media simply exploit an existing prejudice in an article titled on wildebeests and humans the preferential detection of negative stimuli in the journal psychological science researchers showed that subjects remembered negative words faster and more often than positive ones 2 in times of crisis this predisposition gets a steroid boost imagine reading the newspapers and watching tv in the weeks and months surrounding the lehman collapse headline harassment would have taken its toll across the globe no wonder won derful businesses were finally available at a price we could not refuse in sharp contrast there was no celebration of business as usual at the high quality companies that were becoming part of our portfolio during this period no headlines screamed wns processes another mortgage application triveni s factory man ufactures turbine number 39 for the year page industries adds two more retailers today in the city of aurangabad or car borundum factory in chennai finishes another shift earlier i wrote ultimate causes thankfully are way too dull for media coverage now you know why there is one more important reason we could embrace a diametrically opposite attitude to that of many of our peers in 2008 we are fortunate to have long term investors primarily u s university endowments and u s and european family offices who have supported our aggression when the world seemed to be coming to an end not even one investor defaulted on their commit ment no one i hope tore at their hair i know that many private equity and hedge funds could not persuade their investors to commit more capital in 2008 we were very fortunate 2k i don t make predictions but after the global financial crisis of 2008 i told myself that i was unlikely to witness the same degree of stock market panic for decades i couldn t have been more wrong at the height of the covid 19 pandemic dread in march 2020 the indian market fell 23 percent we could not stop buying and our investment in that single month was 12 percent more than in the previous four years combined in sharp contrast the foreign portfolio investors in india withdrew 8 7 billion from the indian stock market in march 2020 we continued to be hyper active until september 2020 and then had to stop because the prices of the businesses we were interested in had increased sharply the total amount we invested in 2020 turned out to be more than one third of our cumulative investments over the thirteen years from 2007 until 2019 i don t know if we made the right decision however i do know that the proximate worries of impending doom for busi nesses like tires enzymes boilers diagnostic services vehicle lending and sanitaryware were divorced from their ultimate causes of success we had been tracking many of these companies for about a decade and had great confidence that they would overcome any short term pain over the longer run in any event we will know soon enough 2030 isn t far away chapter summary evolutionary theory has taught me that we can reimagine investing by ignoring proximate causes of stock price movements while focusing on ultimate explanations of business success 1 evolutionary biology explores natural phenomena by searching for proximate and ultimate causes proximate mechanisms explain immediate influences on a trait the role played by natural selection explains the ultimate cause of an organism s success or failure in an environment 2 thus to understand the impressive size and variety of dung beetle horns evolutionary biologists ask the proximate question e g which network of genes was switched on as well as the ultimate question e g what is the adaptive value of the horns scientists understand that these are different types of questions with different types of answers and that both types must be asked 3 the investing world too must differentiate between proximate and ultimate causes proximate causes of share price changes can result from the macroeconomy the markets the industry or the company itself since proximate causes are highly salient e g the fed announcing an interest rate cut or a company announcing a slowing of sales growth investors may erroneously overweight them in their decision making process 4 we ignore all proximate causes when analyzing businesses we focus exclusively on the business fundamentals or the ulti mate causes of the success or failure of businesses 5 we were aggressive investors during the financial crisis of 2008 and the early days of the covid 19 pandemic because proxi mate worries compelled the markets to overlook the ultimate causes of the success of many high quality businesses chapter 5 darwin ate my dcf when we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship as at something wholly beyond his comprehension when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a history when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances each useful to the possessor nearly in the same way as when we look at any great mechanical invention as the sum ming up of the labour the experience the reason and even the blunders of numerous workmen when we thus view each organic being how far more interesting i speak from experience will the study of natural history become charles darwin on the origin of species chapter 15 recapitulation and conclusion we prefer demonstrated consistent earning power future projections are of little interest to us nor are turn around situations warren buffett annual letter to shareholders 1982 t was a once in a lifetime opportunity for a trip around the world but there was a significant hurdle the twenty two year old man had arrived home late in the night and had been surprised to find a large envelope addressed to him it contained two letters one was from his college tutor and the other from his favorite teacher reverend john stevens henslow the first informed him that a two year voyage around the world would start in a month and the second tried to persuade him to accept the offer the cost of the trip was not an issue for the young man s wealthy father robert the problem was that the young man had already changed his profession twice and showed no signs of settling down he knew that his father was frustrated with him robert considered his son s excitement at the global voyage as evidence of his preoccupation with entertaining but wasteful pursuits also robert demanded why on earth was the young man being offered a naturalist post on this voyage when he was qualified to be a priest the whole scheme appeared dubious the young man s three sisters susan caroline and catherine agreed with their father robert to make matters worse with deep sadness he declined the offer the next day he carried a sealed letter from robert to his uncle jos jos was a close friend and confidant of robert in the letter robert wrote that his son s obsession with navigating the world was a mistake but added if you think differently from me i wish him to follow your advice fortunately for the young man jos disagreed with robert and wholeheartedly supported the voyage in his letter back to robert jos argued that the trip would build the young man s character and far from being a waste it would do him a lot of good jos s clinching argument was that the young man would be better prepared for the church because after all natural history is very suitable to a clergyman robert gave his permission on december 27 1831 on a beautiful sunny morning the beagle lifted anchor from plymouth charles darwin s global circumnavigation would take him to brazil argentina uruguay chile peru new zealand australia mauritius madagascar south africa and the galapagos islands the beagle s voyage would last five years it would change the young man it would change science it would change the world an overlooked reason for the underperformance of fund managers we encountered two harsh realities in the introduction to this book about 90 percent of fund managers cannot beat the market and their performance has worsened over time why do fund managers underperform talk to a dozen insiders and you will get a dozen different reasons for this sorry state one oft repeated complaint is the misalignment of incentives for the fund manager the fund management company gets paid based on the size of the fund not on its performance but over the long term many researchers have found that an increase in fund size can lead to declining per formance for example in a study published in 2009 in the journal of financial and quantitative analysis an analysis of actively managed funds in the united states from 1993 to 2002 demonstrated a significant inverse relation between fund size and fund performance similarly in a 1996 article in the journal financial services review the authors write once large equity funds do not outperform their peers 2 they go on to advise investors to invest in smaller funds in some ways related to the problem of misaligned incentives another reason fund managers underperform is that funds don t like to underperform the market yes ironic isn t it in their attempt not to underperform the market funds end up under performing here is how for simplicity s sake let s assume there are ten stocks in an index each with a weight of 10 percent if the fund invests 100 in the market with 10 invested in each business it has perfectly replicated the index in such a case its active share is said to be zero if the fund invests in none of these stocks its active share is 100 percent thus active share is a measure of the courage and conviction of fund managers those unwilling to risk their careers but happy to compromise returns for their investors have a low active share the daring ones willing to stick their necks out and not mimic the index have a high active share ina 2013 financial analysts journal article the author antti petajisto calculates the active share of 1 380 mutual funds in the united states in 2009 and concludes the performance of closet indexers has been predictably poor 3 he also points out that funds with a high active share add value for investors of the mutual funds he examined only 44 percent had an active share of more than 80 percent have you heard the saying that no one gets fired for hiring ibm something similar seems to be going on in the fund manage ment industry if a fund manager has a low active share they are unlikely to get beaten by the market by a significant margin and since everyone else is in the same boat their risk of getting fired is relatively low at least one thing fund managers have learned from herbivores in the wild is that there is safety in numbers there are many other reasons for fund managers underperformance for example poor performance also correlates with higher portfolio turnover owning stocks with greater liquidity investing in growth stocks higher expense ratios and many other factors you can find all these and many more reasons for the dismal performance of fund managers in numerous research articles in prestigious finance journals what you will not find in these articles is the crux of this chapter i believe a crucial reason for the continued underperfor mance of fund managers is their focus on future rewards while ignoring the treasures of the past we at nalanda pursue the profession of investing the same way evolutionary biologists do we interpret the present in the context of history evolutionary biology does not make predictions as physics and chemistry do nor do we instead our invest ment approach attempts to explain the present by interpreting what occurred in the past in an essay on the theory of evolution the late harvard paleontologist stephen jay gould wrote the present becomes relevant and the past therefore becomes scientific only if we can sum the small effects of present processes to produce observed results he could have been writing about the way we invest how extremely stupid not to have thought of that let s join the young charles darwin who has embarked on a life altering journey aboard the beagle 5 although darwin attained fame as a zoologist and botanist he boarded the beagle as an enthusiastic geologist darwin s first foray as a scientist was with his professor adam sedgwick when they tried to map the geology of northern wales in the summer of 1831 he concluded after this trip that science consists in grouping facts so that the general laws or conclusions may be drawn from them at the end of the beagle expedition he had 368 pages of zoology notes compared to 1 383 pages of geology notes the famous geologist charles lyell was a great inspiration to darwin he took the first volume of lyell s book principles of geology with him on the beagle he received the second volume later in the voyage and read the third after his return home lyell was a strong proponent of uniformitarianism as the core tenet of geology darwin would later adopt it as a guiding principle of his evolutionary theory uniformitarianism claims that all significant changes on earth result from slow and steady natural processes operating over millions of years asa result of his interest in and exposure to geology darwin was preprogrammed to conceptualize very long periods unimaginable to most humans he was the first to comprehend the importance of deep time in evolution he wrote i always feel as if my books came half out of lyell s brain and that i have never acknowledged it sufficiently i have always thought that great merit of principles was that it altered the whole tone of one s mind darwin wrote more than twenty five books and hundreds more have been written about him and his oeuvre we can t cover even a fraction of his genius here in this chapter i want to focus on only one aspect of his method which is evident in his groundbreaking book on the origin of species his focus on historical information to make deductions about ongoing evolutionary processes darwin proposed not one not two but three revolutionary theories in origin natural selection sexual selection and com mon ancestry let s briefly see what these theories are and how he used history in all of them to arrive at his radical explanation of all organic life first let s discuss his best known theory natural selection in my layperson s view the reason darwin s crowning achievement the theory of natural selection was not discovered earlier and remained unaccepted by many stalwarts during and after his lifetime was that few understood the powerful effect of small changes accumulated over very long periods of time but for those who understood the relevance of history the theory was so powerful and straightforward that the famous biologist thomas huxley remarked how extremely stupid not to have thought of that s natural selection requires three key ingredients 2 first there needs to be random variation among the progeny of an organ ism note the word random variation does not seek any goal second there needs to be differential fitness among these variants such that injurious variations get rejected and favorable ones are preserved last the favorable traits must be heritable so that they are passed on to the next generation then these three elements repeat ad infinitum over millions even billions of years result ing in a pangolin from a protozoan in darwin s own words this preservation of favorable individual differences and variations and the destruction of those which are injurious i have called natural selection let s look at giraffes to understand darwin s insight they are members of the order artiodactyla and diverged from the other members cattle antelope deer and sheep about thirty four million years ago 12 an ancestor of the current giraffe may have given birth to a baby with a slightly longer neck owing to a random mutation there was no reason for this mutation the animal was not looking to grow a longer neck it just happened this long necked creature may have had better nutrition on reaching adulthood than its herbivore competitors because it could reach taller trees to eat more succulent shoots and leaves better and more food could have made this giraffe healthier and more robust helping it evade predators consequently it could have mated more frequently and produced more offspring than its shorter necked competitors these offspring would generally have had long necks but neck length would have varied the longer necked ones would be likely to have better nutrition be subject to lower predation and have more mates than their shorter necked siblings and because long necks are heritable darwin did not know that genes are responsible for heredity but he knew that something was some of the offspring of these longer necked giraffes would also have had longer necks and continue to be more ad vantaged than their shorter necked siblings and competitors generation after generation this arms race for long necks has gone on for millennia and voila we have the current day giraffe darwin collated a vast range of historical clues to arrive at his theory of natural selection and this is not the place to list all of them so instead let me share just a few darwin was a creationist when he started his journey aboard hms beagle whilst on board the beagle i was quite orthodox he writes in his autobiography 1 at cambridge darwin had studied the books of reverend william paley who had made the fa mous watch analogy to prove the existence of god 12 paley s argument ran as follows he asserted that if someone were to finda watch with all its complex machinery lying on the ground one would conclude that someone knowledgeable had produced it the various parts of the watch working in perfect unison could not have been assembled by accident hence paley argued that since nature is infinitely more complex than a watch we must conclude that an intelligent designer is behind the universe s creation as darwin sailed around the world observing nature collecting specimens and writing copious notes he started harboring doubts then in 1832 he found his first fossil remains in an argentinian bay called punta alta the fossilized thigh bone and teeth seemed to be from an extinct giant sloth georges cuvier the founder of paleontology showed that the earth had witnessed many extinction episodes and presented two indisputable facts 2 first the fossil remains of the past have no living peers second the older the fossil the greater the diver gence from living species however cuvier explained these facts by invoking god claiming that god repopulated the earth with new species after each extinction if this were so darwin wondered why would today s sloths have a very similar bone structure to the extinct sloths of the past if god had created them independently why did the extinct giant sloth and the currently living sloth species appear related he found many more fossils during the voyage and the question continued to trouble him one of the core tenets of creationism is that god populated similar plants and animals in comparable climatic and physical environments but darwin discovered that this wasn t so the creatures on the tropical galapagos islands did not resemble the flora and fauna of the tropics elsewhere in the world instead they seemed closely allied with the organisms on the mainland of south america as he wrote in origin the most striking and important fact for us is the affinity of the species which inhabit is lands to those of the nearest mainland without being actually the same 14 darwin s ornithologist friend john gould informed him in march 1837 that twenty five of the twenty six birds from gala pagos were endemic to the islands and found nowhere else 15 creationism s contention had always been that god created species individually and that all species remained unchanged following their creation 1 but then how did one explain the diversity of the galapagos bird species all were similar to but also quite different from mainland species darwin reached a much different con clusion that a species of bird from the mainland had accidentally arrived on galapagos eons ago and had then diverged into many species occupying different niches to me one of the best examples of darwin s remarkable ability to view history in a new light is his discussion of domestic pigeons in the first chapter of origin he studied the pigeons closely for many years he bought every breed he could lay his hands on and reared them himself he also procured pigeon skins from as far away as persia he made friends with many well regarded london breeders and joined two pigeon clubs pigeons were big business in nineteenth century england and they obsessed dar win as well over six pages of origin darwin outlines the distinctiveness of various breeds he starts compare the english carrier and the short faced tumbler and see the wonderful difference in their beaks entailing corresponding differences in their skulls next he described various breeds diversity of beaks sizes shapes colors and flight patterns like most naturalists of the era he believed that all these varieties had descended from an ancestral rock pigeon columba livia in origin he also provides ample evi dence for this belief his friend professor lepsius had informed darwin that humans had been domesticating pigeons for thousands of years there were records of pigeons in the fifth egyptian dynasty in 3000 bce pigeons also had high prestige and monetary value in the time of the romans and mughals in india it was evident that humans had altered pigeons over many years to suit their unique tastes he called this phenomenon artificial selection and then he took the bold leap that no one else had taken before him he asserted slow though the process of selection may be if a feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection i can see no limit to the amount of change to the infinite beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings one with another and with their physical conditions of life which may be affected in the long course of time by nature s power of selection 2 if humans could alter pigeons drastically given the immensely long time at its disposal why couldn t nature vary organic beings to create the diversity we see today it may seem blindingly obvious to us but no naturalist had connected the artificially created variety of breeds of pigeons dogs or plants to the ubiquitous natural heterogeneity of the natural world the puzzle of the peacock s tail darwin s second bold conjecture in origin was sexual selection the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick darwin wrote 12 he felt that a male ornament like the resplendent peacocks tail contradicted the theory of natural selection because it was a handicap to the peacock s survival why would a peacock evolve to endanger its chances of a long life darwin concluded that the currency of natural selection is not just survival but reproduction any character trait that allows an animal to produce more offspring is a winner in the long run because those offspring in turn are able to produce more of themselves a peacock with a showier tail will attract more peahens to sire more offspring over his lifetime consequently there would be a race for even more elaborate tails in origin he writes this form of selection depends not ona struggle for existence in relation to other organic beings or to external conditions but on a struggle between the individu als of one sex generally the males for the possession of the other sex male peacocks struggle with each other through the beauty of their tails the struggle is not for existence but sexual partners darwin also shocked his victorian era readers by giving agency to the females contending i can see no good reason to doubt that female birds by selecting during thousands of generations the most melodious or beautiful males according to their standard of beauty might produce a marked effect he was claiming that the beauty of the peacock s tail was under the control of the peahens it was the peahens who arbitrarily decided the aesthetics of a tail sexual selection is not limited to birds of course like generations of naturalists before him darwin observed male stags cocks beetles and predatory species fight aggressively over females a hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of leaving numerous offspring he rightly pointed out he compared male appendages like a lion s mane or the hooked jaw of a salmon to a sword or spear a stag with unwieldy horns may be easier fodder for a lion but would end up fathering many more off spring than a stag with unimpressive horns just as with natural selection darwin formulated his theory of sexual selection by examining well established facts ina new light we are one darwin s third assertion of common ancestry in origin was his most significant intellectual leap in my layperson s view in his words i believe that animals have descended from at most only four or five progenitors and plants from an equal or lesser number analogy would lead me one step further namely to the belief that all animals and plants have descended from some prototype many victorians did not even accept that black and white humans descended from a common stock and here was darwin claiming unity across disparate species chapter 14 of origin presents copious evidence to bolster his claim that most species have evolved from very few common ancestors he called this phenomenon descent with modification he starts by pointing out the obvious organic beings are nested within groups 2 the hierarchy levels in ascending order are as follows species genus family order class phylum and kingdom thus dogs are the species canis familiaris and belong to the genus canis when grouped with wolves and jackals they be long to the family canidae when canidae is grouped with other families like felidae cats ursidae bears mustelidae weasels and many others we get to the order carnivora carnivora brackets along cetacea whales and dolphins perissodactyla horses tapirs sirenia dugongs lagomorpha rabbits and others to form the class mammalia mammalia amphibia and other classes merge to form the phylum chordata chordates mollusks nematodes and numerous other phyla cluster to create the kingdom animalia carolus linnaeus the swedish botanist laid the groundwork for this classification system in 1735 in systema naturae the system of nature 2 naturalists had made mutually exclusive divisions before linnaeus his genius was to see all of life as a nested hierarchy linnaeus was a highly devout man and believed that nature s hierarchical system resulted from god s plan amazingly the modern organization of the living world follows linnaeus s system with only a few modifications as you can see there seems to be a particular natural order to this system dogs appear rightly classified along with jackals canidae and felidae are at the same level of family and how else does one group horses and dugongs except under the class of mammals but as darwin writes in chapter 14 of origin some deeper bond is included in our classifications than mere resem blance i believe that this is the case and that community of descent the one known cause of close similarity in organic beings is the bond which though observed by various degrees of modification is partially revealed to us by our classifications darwin was making a strikingly original argument the classification system seems right to us because it reflects the path of evolution of all living beings on earth linnaeus demonstrated that all organic life is connected he credited god for this natural order darwin concluded that it could be so only if all organisms had one or just a few common ancestors darwin provides two additional pieces of proof of common ancestry first the early stage embryos of seemingly unrelated groups like mammals birds and reptiles resemble one another so closely that it is hard to distinguish between them i guarantee that the similarities in figure 5 1 will floor you it is almost impossible to distinguish the five species in the figure when they are in the early embryonic stage in a later stage of development a salamander resembles a fish and a human looks like a turtle why should this be so thus community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent darwin writes human chicken turtle salamander fish 5 1 the stages of development of five species is there a difference among the early embryos of a fish a turtle and a human source licensed from istockphoto getty images second he offers rudimentary organs as evidence of the kinship of ancestral and living forms by rudimentary organs darwin meant vestigial organs that persist in an organism but have lost their function he offered many examples mammaries in male mammals fused and useless wings in beetles gills in the land dwelling tadpoles of the common salamander teeth in the upper jaw of calves that never cut through the gums and rudiments of hind limbs and a pelvis in boa constrictors darwin opined that formerly functional parts might become vestigial if they aren t used ergo vestigial body parts establish a direct line between organisms and a distant common ancestor a tadpole that breathes on land but has useless gills should have a common ancestor with waterborne animals the hidden hind limbs in a boa constrictor unite it ancestrally with animals that have legs fused wings in beetles show that it has descended from an ancestor that gave rise to insects with wings and so on darwin was right of course scientists have concluded that our last universal common ancestor luca arose somewhere between 3 5 and 4 billion years ago 2 luca then gave rise to the six significant kingdoms of life animals plants fungi protists eubacteria and archaea although darwin wasn t aware of four of these six kingdoms i find it staggering that he still arrived at the correct conclusion what a genius investing as a historical discipline the investment profession invites soothsayers of all kinds some are shady but most are well meaning professionals who expend enormous energy pontificating over the future we aren t one of them i want to clarify an important point before we march ahead darwin and his theories are incomparable in my view no scien tist comes close to him in greatness maybe only einstein but probably not even him when i compare darwin s scientific process to what we do i do it with full knowledge that it is markedly worse than comparing a gargantuan apple with a tiny orange in the broad scheme of things i think we financial investors are irrelevant to this world darwin wasn t back to the lessons from darwin like darwin we interpret the present only in the context of history we see the same set of historical facts as everyone else we have no interest in forecasting the future we study the history of a business to understand its financials assess its strategies gauge its competitive position and finally assign value to it so let s take them one by one understanding the financials of a business those of you in the financial industry must have seen analyst reports however if you aren t a finance professional or haven t seen an analyst report before here is a brief description the brokerage firms like jpmorgan morgan stanley and goldman sachs employ research analysts who as the name suggests perform detailed research on publicly listed businesses and publish reports for their clients the investors a typical analyst report describes a company s business and financials expresses its overall strategy and direction and recommends that the clients buy hold or sell the business depending on the brokerage the analysts use a wide variety of phrases underperform overweight accumulate neutral and other esoteric terms to make their recommen dations still their recommendations essentially fall into the buy hold or sell category along with business commentary most analyst reports typically carry the profit and loss account and the balance sheet of the latest fiscal year and financial projections for the next two to five years in many of these reports you will not find the finan cials of the past two to three years let alone the last five to ten years if you are keen to know the company s revenue growth over the past five years the long term historical trend of margins or how roce and free cash flow have fluctuated over a decade you are on your own as i write this i have in my hand analyst reports from five brokerages for tata consultancy services india s largest technol ogy services business with a market value of about 150 billion they all have financial projections for the next two to three years and actual financials for the past year only one provides three year historical financials none has a five to ten year financial history an actual incident will illuminate the reason for this state of affairs three of us were visiting one of our portfolio companies a few years ago we met with the ceo and cfo for about an hour or so as we were about to depart the cfo received a call on his mobile phone got visibly upset at the caller and exclaimed i can t say anything the results will be out after a few weeks it turns out that the caller was a well known investor who was checking to see how the quarter was progressing on the revenue and profit front if investors hound the company management for following quarter results wouldn t they do the same with research ana lysts so why should the analysts bother with longer term history analysts produce forecasts because their clients demand they produce forecasts i am sure many of them know it is a futile exercise here is why let s say i need to project the following year s financials i will need to forecast at least ten if not more numbers ranging from units sold price per unit cost of goods sold sales expenses receivables capital expenditure and so on let s assume that iam a great guesser and that i will correctly guess each of the ten numbers with a 90 percent probability hence the chance of guessing all ten numbers correctly for next year would be only 35 percent 0 9019 one may quibble that not all ten are independent vari ables so we should not multiply them true but the number of variables is much greater than ten and they are all at least semi independent whichever way you evaluate the probability of guessing the next year s financials correctly it is probably worse than guessing heads or tails after tossing a coin but this was only for next year i also need to project for the following year and the year after that how accurate do you think my estimates will be the only financials we prepare are for the past decade or more our financial trackers have no projections instead we use the same factual financial information to which everyone else has access not unlike darwin in developing his theories darwin did not have special access to any confidential data or information the beagle trip did expose him to new lands and creatures but he did not make any discoveries during the five year trip darwin did collect 1 529 species in spirits and 3 907 samples of skin bone and other specimens 22 but in all my research i did not get the sense that he had stumbled upon anything significant unknown to science there were occasions when experts enlightened darwin with new facts about the specimens he had collected for example in 1845 darwin s botanist friend joseph hooker identified more than 200 plant species collected by darwin and his team on gala pagos 22 about 150 of these were unique to single islands but they were also related to plants on other islands that weren t found anywhere else on earth some plant ancestors like those of the birds had accidentally arrived on galapagos a long time ago and had diversified into many species over time by adapting to the local environment ornithologists and naturalists had been observing the mating rituals of peacocks for centuries but no one else had given agency to the female for selecting male feathers even amateur ornithologists knew that only the male birds were adorned gor geous plumage and that the diversity of size shape and color of feathers was truly staggering across all bird species but no or nithologist interpreted their observations in the light of sexual selection the way darwin did similarly linnaeus s systema naturae was no secret its botanical classification system based on male and female sexes of plants had built linnaeus s reputation and fame linnaeus modified his sexual classification system of plants in his subsequent publication genera plantarum genera classified plants based on what he called the natural characters of the genera the mor phological traits of flowers and fruits however neither he nor anyone else could explain the source of this natural order except to claim that it was god s plan eighty years after linnaeus s death darwin finally explained this natural order by invoking his theory of common descent as you can see in every case darwin had the same historical facts as everyone else it was only his interpretations that were radically new and different i would like to believe our approach is no different if we don t forecast financials what do we do with historical numbers a lot as permanent owners we are incredibly paranoid about the financial performance of our businesses so here is the way we use historical financials to assess our portfolio companies let me take the example of berger paints india s second largest paint business we have owned berger since 2008 when berger declares its quarterly results we perform two broad historical analyses absolute and relative for example why has revenue growth declined to 10 percent over the past year compared to its longer term average of 15 to 16 percent what could be the reasons for high margins for the third year in a row has the company started spending less than usual on sales and marketing what has led to a significant decline in receivables this quarter is the capital expenditure over the past year higher than usual what has driven the increase in roce over the last two years versus the five years before we don t stop at analyzing berger s results in the context of its long term history as permanent owners we want to invest in a business that performs well on a relative basis that is one that performs better than the overall competition we compare berger s quarter last twelve months and longer term performance against the competition on parameters like revenue and profit market share roce and free cash flow among many others we track berger primarily against four competitors asian paints the industry leader kansai nerolac akzo nobel and indigo in addition we seek market feedback on smaller or private businesses that may have started growing aggressively this competitive analysis through the financials can lead us to ask if berger has lost or gained market share this quarter and last year what has driven kansai s increased revenue share over the past two years who is gaining the most from akzo s share loss has indigo been able to expand outside kerala what is the trend in berger s advertising expenses relative to its competitors as you can see there is a lot we do with historical financial information what i have outlined here are the sample issues we raise for a portfolio company the analysis is no different when evaluating a new business we demand stellar absolute and relative financial performance based on any potential investment s actual financial track record why fritter away time making useless forecasts with so much to do with the historical information we already have assessing the strategies of a business strategy is a loaded word for our purpose let me just define it as whatever companies do to achieve their goals under condi tions of uncertainty purists will quibble on the definition of tactics versus strategy let them as folks investing real money we can move on to more practical problems by now i assume you can predict what i am about to write yes we assess historical strategies to understand businesses asmall sample of strategic issues we focus on which customer segments have you targeted how have your products or services served the needs of customers in what ways have you been different from the competition how have you allocated capital his torically what has been your capital structure and why two things may be evident to you as you read these questions they are about the company s strategic steps in the past and these are issues that even a first year undergrad could raise what s so great about these questions nothing we ask these ques tions not to evaluate the answers objectively but to subjectively assess if they fit our preexisting hypotheses of success or failure yes we know the answer we want before we have asked the first question if we have done a decent job over many years it is not a result of asking these mundane questions but because our under lying bias demands the answers fit our template we have our templates for success and failure and we aim to assess if the com pany s strategy fits a pattern very few do more on this in chapter 6 this approach is not very different from darwin s who famously wrote in a letter to one henry fawcett in 1861 how odd it is that everyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service 24 darwin s unique ability was to assess objective information available to everyone in the light of his subjective hypothesis take his view on why there should be a struggle for existence in 1798 thomas malthus an english economist published an essay on the principle of population growth 2 malthus argued that the human population increases exponentially whereas food resources grow linearly so human prosperity will be impossible unless there are strict limits on reproduction further malthus wrote that unless humans started having fewer children the inevitable food shortage would curse humanity to an eternal strug gle for existence only famine war and disease would check population growth it was a dark and pessimistic view of humanity darwin read malthus s essay in 1838 and he extended the domain of applicability of malthus s principle to the entire living world 2s no one had done this before i can t do better than the master s own words every being which during its natural life time produces several eggs or seeds must suffer destruction during some period of its life and during some season or occasional year otherwise on the principle of geometric increase its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the product hence as more individuals are produced than can survive there must in every case be a struggle for existence either one individual with another of the same species or with the individuals of distinct species or with the physical conditions of life like everyone around him darwin saw that no animal or plant species dominated our planet although many produced hundreds or thousands of seeds or offspring however no one else interpreted history the way he did with malthus s inspiration he explained the current state of the organic world by invoking the hypothesis of the unimaginable historical destruction and an nihilation of organisms his observations fit the template of the struggle for existence there is probably no better way to explain this than with a real example from the world of investing we are shareholders in acompany called nrb bearings its owner and ceo harshbeena zaveri is an anthropology graduate from wellesley she is proba bly the best strategic thinker in our portfolio nrb manufactures needle roller bearings for the automotive industry and has about 65 to 70 percent market share in india the global giant schaeffler accounts for the rest bearings account for just 1 to 2 percent of the cost of a vehicle but are critical components failure can lead to severe accidents we avoid the automotive component space because in general its clients the automotive companies do not allow them to make money in the united states for example the top five car companies controlled about two thirds of the market in 2021 22 this concentration allows them to drive a tough bargain with their suppliers the automotive component companies unsurpris ingly not many parts suppliers can consistently earn a decent profit india is even more consolidated than the united states the dominant car company maruti suzuki controls half the indian market the indian motorcycle market is an oligopoly of just three companies it is not unusual for a parts supplier to have a huge customer concentration a top customer typically accounts for 30 to 50 percent of revenues hence our bias is to reject almost every automotive component business there can be an exception though but that exception must fit the following template first the parts supplier would need to manufacture a critical component requiring pro prietary technology and have a low customer concentration over many years it should have only one or two competitors and the competitive dynamics in the industry should be stable over the long term finally there should have been no new entrants to the industry for many years and the company should have delivered good financials historically note that not a single criterion here is about the future nrb ticked every box and so when the company valuation came to the level we liked we swooped in to buy 10 percent of the business we studied history built hypotheses did not bother predicting and have been happy owners in the business since 2013 assessing the strategy of a business is useless unless we have a strategy to comprehend the strategy gauging the competitive position of a business darwin discovered that the success of a species is not dependent on its being the best but simply being better than the competi tion this joke will make it more straightforward when two friends hiking in a forest spot a lion one starts putting on his running shoes his friend says what are you doing that for you can t possibly outrun a lion the man replies i know but i need only to run faster than you not the lion we humans do not possess an ideal body or brain design as those with back pain hernias or the desire to make leveraged crypto trades will confess but as a species we were undoubtedly better than tens of other sister species in the homo genus and that has allowed more than eight billion of us to rule the world investors analysts and academics have beaten the term sustainable competitive advantage to death still as in evolu tionary theory the real question is not just about sustainable competitive advantage but about being consistently better than the competition and what is the meaning of better for us it relates to measurable parameters like roce market share free cash flow balance sheet strength consistency of financials and other such measures we assess all these historically so the question for us is never will you be better than the competition but have you con sistently been better than the competition let s pick market share as an example if a company is consistently losing market share and if softbank tiger alibaba or naspers has not offered a billion dollars to its competitors so they can burn cash mindlessly no one can convince me that the com pany has a sustainable competitive advantage on the other hand if a company is consistently gaining market share isn t it highly likely that they have built a defensible moat we want our businesses to gain market share over the long term recognizing full well that the trend line may occasionally reverse in the short term in this context it may be informative to share one of my early mistakes in the fund with you this small sized business was ina fragmented industry in which most businesses made decent roce this business had roce of over 30 percent and had grown at an annualized rate of 29 percent over the previous three years the company had no leverage we invested at what we thought was an attractive price after selling it at a loss of about 40 percent after five years i concluded that price was the least of my prob lems i had erred in sizing up the competitive advantage of the business the company had performed reasonably well in the past few years but it had lost significant market share over the long term the two most prominent players in the industry founded around the same time as this company were more than twenty times the revenue of this business the third largest business founded twelve years after the inception of our company was al ready eleven times larger in revenue in our diligence process we received a lot of qualitative information from the management customers and even competi tors about how the company s strategy and direction had started yielding fruit in recent years the company had been performing well recently but with a longer term lens i should have seen that the company was a chronic underperformer moreover the same team of founder managers had been running the business since its inception so how could the following five year result be any different from the past twenty five ihad made a big blunder when it comes to gauging competitive position barring some exceptions there is almost nothing better than measuring market share of volume revenue and profit over a long period we live and learn assigning value to a business a few years ago a fund manager friend and i were meeting for coffee he wanted to know how our portfolio was performing and i started complaining mildly about the high valuation of our businesses i wanted to buy more of these companies but the prices seemed to have run up a lot my friend was surprised and countered that the valuations weren t too high they seemed reasonable i would say company a is at 45 pe price earnings ratio and he would counter no it s only 25 pe i would then complain about company y being 55 pe and he would appear surprised and correct me that the pe for the company was only 28 1 was now frustrated and he appeared pretty surprised did i not know the valuation of my businesses and then it struck me when i said 45 pe i meant to say 45 times trailing pe when he said 25 pe he meant 25 times forward pe his forward pe was not for the next year but for two years later for those unfamiliar with our industry s terminology i had valued our business based on the actual delivered earnings of the past year on the other hand my friend had taken the average industry estimates of company earnings two years in the future and calculated the pe based on these forecasted earnings the following example will make this clearer let s say that the profit after tax of a company in the past twelve months is 10 million and that its market value is 450 million this gives a trailing pe of 45 450 10 if the consensus analyst estimates are that the company s earnings will be 14 million next year and 18 million the year after that the one year forward pe for the same business will be 32 450 14 and the two year forward pe will be 25 450 18 which of these three 45 32 or 25 is the correct pe it depends on the investor for us it is the backward looking 45 and for my friend it is the forward looking 25 most discussions of pe or other valuation ratios like price book or enterprise value ebitda are forward looking the only pe ratio we discuss relates to the delivered earnings of the past it may be the previous twelve months or the past three years or for some highly cyclical businesses even the past ten year average pe i e current mar ket value divided by the average earnings of the past ten years we also use other valuation metrics but all value the current busi ness based on its past performance ican understand if some investors project earnings over one or two years since that s not too far in the future it s not ideal but i get it what i fail to fathom is why investors do something worse much worse it s called discounted cash flow dcf analysis here is a simple way to understand it let s say it s the year 2000 and your mom promises to give you 100 a year for the next two years you need the cash urgently and you ask mom to give you the cash today instead she will not give you 200 since the value of 100 in 2001 and 2002 is lower than in 2000 yes mom isa stickler and a good mathematician how much money should she give you you will need a dcf analysis to arrive at the answer for this you will need a discount rate or cost of capital 22 mom decides that it should be 5 percent maybe because this is the bank interest rate thus the value of 100 in 2001 is 95 in 2000 100 1 05 the value of 100 in 2002 is 91 in 2000 100 1 052 thus if you choose to take all the money today she should give you 186 95 91 this is a simple dcf analysis so far so good the problem starts when you replace your mom with a company whoa did i just say that but you know what i mean if you don t let me elaborate as per corporate finance theory the value of a business is simply the sum of all its future cash flows discounted to the present time this makes academic sense it s true mathematically but as a practical way to invest it borders on being nonsensical let s understand why there are two main requirements for building a dcf spreadsheet the discount rate and the cash flow projection let s start with the discount rate the discount rate is the weighted average costs of debt and equity it is equivalent to the 5 percent we used in the example with your mom i understand the cost of debt but what is the cost of equity corporate finance theory comes to the rescue and provides a clean cut official formula the formula is as follows risk free rate b x expected market return risk free rate looks neat right just plug in the numbers to get the answer don t be fooled though it hides several vast issues let s begin with the greek letter 8 beta which indicates riskiness it measures the volatility of a stock relative to the mar ket thus a stock that moves in perfect synchrony with the market will have a b of 1 but again isn t the notion of measuring risk by using volatility as a proxy quite silly as i discussed in chapter 1 how does riskiness have anything to do with volatility for an investor the riskiness of a business is directly proportional to the probability of capital loss of investing in that business the higher the potential loss the higher the risk i don t care about b and never will as you can see in the formula we need a number for the expected market return ask ten experts and you will get ten differ ent answers for expected market return what number should i pick average median whatever i like the formula has no advice to offer do you see anything in the formula about how much debt the company is carrying do you think a company with a consid erable debt load should have the same cost of equity as a company with no debt the formula does not believe so it is bizarre and almost laughable distressed companies with high leverage get sold for a pittance because the equity investors demand a high cost of equity as if all this is not enough let s look at the damaging impact of pretending that an impressive looking math formula will protect us from egregious errors let s go back to your mom if she decides to discount cash flow by 7 percent instead of 5 percent she will give you only 181 not 186 but if she discounts at 3 percent you will receive 5 extra or 191 a dcf analysis assumes cash flows in perpetuity and so the present value of this formulation is much more sensitive to the discount rate than the one used by your mom for example assume that a cash flow of 100 grows by 10 percent over twenty five years using a discount rate of 10 percent the discounted present value of this series is 2 273 what if we reduce the discount rate by just one percentage point to 9 percent the value jumps by 13 percent to 2 565 similarly a one percentage point increase in discount rate chops off 11 percent of the present value what s the use of fooling oneself that the mathematical precision of a discount rate with two decimal places is any better than guesswork and now believe it or not we come to the real problem of using dcf yes we haven t even started yet back to mom she had promised us 100 for the next two years can a company promise to do the same for an indefinite fu ture of course not but the dcf technique demands that we forecast cash flows so that is what everyone does theoretically i need to make these projections in perpetuity but for convenience i will just use a terminal value at the end of the tenth year to make my task easy let s not wade into the problems of terminal value which is a cesspit trust me you will get indigestion even if you aren t from the financial community you may have read or heard of the stock prices of individual companies suddenly dropping or increasing massively let s take the example of snapchat an app that every teenager with a smartphone seems to be using 22 in early may 2017 snapchat s share price dropped almost 25 percent in a single day after the company declared financial results that showed slower growth than expected and a massive loss of 2 2 billion there was a lot of public information available on the company and since snapchat had listed only recently investors and analysts had analyzed its future cash flows in gory detail they had not foreseen the abysmal financial results if investors can t forecast cash flows even a few days or months in advance how can they be expected to project cash flows years ahead but this is what the dcf methodology demands investors and analysts rarely fail to build massive complicated financial models that assess dozens of factors to project cash flows over many years in the future hail excel it s not that the builders of these excel models whether analysts bankers consultants or investors are unaware of the pitfalls but for some reason the deep desire to look far in the future to arrive at an exact number overwhelms the rational voice ad monishing the person to stop pretending they are doing anything useful one of the best ways for you to get a sense of this future obsession is to read the transcripts of a company s quarterly results conference calls most companies post such transcripts in their websites investor relations section i analyzed three conference call transcripts for walmart for q2 2018 p g for q4 2017 and general motors for q2 2017 and the results are stark for walmart analysts and investors focused twenty eight out of forty nine questions on the future e g implied ebit margin direction within the guidance on the p g call fourteen out of twenty questions asked the management to make some kind of prediction e g do you have more initiatives hitting the market at general motors a staggering twenty seven out of thirty three questions were forward looking e g what should we think about the cadence of the expected savings from the re structuring actions the tug of war between the analyst and the management team is occasionally painful to witness the former tries to pin down exact forecasts for revenues and margins so that they can populate the dcf model knowing full well that the future is in herently unpredictable the latter attempts to sidestep the question with some broad generic comments for example on the general motors call for q2 2017 an analyst wanted to know the revenue projection for onstar an advanced communication system installed in gm cars the answer from the cfo was as we have talked about before yes onstar is generating revenue we don t disclose it separately it continues to grow my sympathies lie with company management they know that they don t know what the future will bring but on the other hand most analysts and fund managers having never worked in a company think that it is the management s job to know the future how else how will they be able to populate their dcf models i have been on the boards of more than twenty five companies and over the years i have never seen a management team meet its budgets some exceed their projections and some undershoot occasionally the over or underperformance is by a wide margin if the company management can t forecast correctly how can investors do so they can t more importantly they shouldn t try we have never done a dcf analysis and never will however i know many if not most investors and analysts do maybe they have figured out a method to look far into the future that eludes me in any event our approach is straightforward let me take the example of a noncyclical business growing at a moderate pace we know the market trailing pe multiple is about 19 or 20 we pay a multiple at or below the market for an exceptional business with high roce a wide moat and low busi ness and financial risk occasionally we stretch a bit by paying a trailing multiple in the high teens or low 20s for a truly unique business but these occasions are few and far between the median trailing pe multiple for our portfolio when we bought the com panies is 14 9 we refine this method for cyclical businesses and those that haven t shown steady growth in earnings e g if earnings stayed flat for the previous five years or doubled in the past year but the general principle is that we assign a fair valuation based on historical delivered financials oh one last point on valuation it is always the last thing we discuss when evaluating a business risk comes first quality second and valuation last what is necessary need not be sufficient in the words of douglas futuyma a professor at the state university of new york at stony brook the core of evolutionary biology consists of describing and analyzing the history of evolution and of analyzing the causes and mechanisms of evolution 22 as a result the natural world throws up several questions that we can t answer without drawing inferences about historical processes for example why do females fight over males in some species why are there two sexes and not five why does only a tiny part of our genome code for proteins why do lions commit infanticide how did birds evolve from dinosaurs as long term investors we have dissociated ourselves from the what will happen obsession and replaced it with what has actually happened the former is a laundry list of conjectures and opinions and the latter to a large extent consists of facts of course facts in and of themselves are empty and what matters is the opinions we build onto those facts but at least they give us a foundation for a discussion for example if a company has had a historical roce over the past decade of 40 percent two investors could have widely different opinions of this fact one could assert that the company has a great future and the other could argue that microe conomic theory demands that these returns will be competed away understanding that the company has had unusually high returns in the past focuses the investors attention on the sources of these returns and their sustainability for example did the company earn these returns because of regulatory protection from overseas competition and if so are we comfortable backing a business that has not faced genuine competition or were these returns earned despite fierce competition what has the company done relative to the competition that has made it so unique our focus on interpreting the present in the context of history is not free of problems let me share two categories of issues both relate to the issue of necessity versus sufficiency of track record the once famous company nokia exemplifies the first category of issues nokia was a high flying company in the late 1990s and dominated the mobile phone market in the same way that the iphone does today 2 large emerging markets like china and india were severely underpenetrated in the mobile phone sector in the 1990s based on historical performance it appeared that nokia would conquer the world investors couldn t buy enough nokia stock and at its peak in the year 2000 nokia s market value was about 325 billion since then it has lost more than 90 percent of its value in the year 2000 all the historical signals from the company its financial performance competitive position reputation and dealer and customer feedback would have screamed this is an amazing company but nokia could not compete with apple samsung or tens of local chinese and indian competitors over the next decade and the nokia phone is now a museum relic anyone relying only on the history of nokia would have suffered massive losses giving weight to a track record is a neces sary condition for investment success but it is in no way sufficient we find this to be especially true in fast changing industries that may or may not be technology related thus in the case of nokia while most historical signals would have led one to conclude that the company had been truly outstanding the very nature of the technology industry in which rapid change is the norm should have made any investor pause we have avoided fast changing industries like the plague and many are not even in the technology space industries like retailing microfinance food delivery and e commerce are in the early stages of evolution in india there is way too much turmoil in these industries for us to feel comfortable using only historical information to invest should an investor avoid technology companies and other rapidly evolving industries we do mainly because we are unable to decipher historical signals for companies in these industries but many investors have figured out ways of assessing these in dustries i don t know how to analyze fast evolving sectors and businesses so i don t when encountering a nokia like business i am very comfortable saying i can t figure this out so thanks but no thanks we can summarize the second problem of historical analysis in one word starbucks in this case relying on history would not have helped us identify a spectacular turnaround thereby depriving us of poten tially a substantial money making opportunity howard schultz bought starbucks in 1982 and from a mere four stores in seattle he grew it to about 2 billion in revenue by 2000 unfortunately he left starbucks in 2000 owing to exhaustion and not long after starbucks started underperforming when schultz returned to the company in 2008 there was bad news all around 22 sales had been flagging for some time mcdonald s and dunkin donuts had dramatically increased pressure on the company by launching their own gourmet coffee brands as a result the stock price had fallen by almost half over the previous year from 2008 schultz led a dramatic turnaround in starbucks fortunes by cutting back on expansion closing hundreds of stores creating a new instant coffee brand and refocus ing on the consumer investors fell in love with the company again the stock price jumped more than eighteen fold from decem ber 2008 to december 2019 let s take ourselves back to 2008 when everything seemed to be falling apart at starbucks all the historical signals customer feedback market share same store sales growth pointed to a company struggling to regain its lost glory schultz may have been the ceo eight years previously but the company had changed a lot since then there were thousands of new stores the management was different and customer and competitor behavior were different too schultz may have revived the company but there is no evidence that founders are the best turnaround artists in 2008 given the lack of historical data pointing to a turn around i would not have invested in the company and lost out on a huge potential gain what is the solution i don t know a way but if you can somehow figure out a company s future in a fast changing industry or bet ona turnaround all power to you for the rest of us who are mere mortals relying on history is a time tested way to keep the odds firmly in our favor of course it will not guarantee a win every time no investment approach can but it will allow us to win often enough 2k i changed seven schools in twelve years because my father was in the armed forces and they transferred him every two years these were all government schools where the quality of teachers wasn t usually the best to put it mildly however i doubt even the best private schools had someone like the incredible mr rathod we had recently arrived in a small town called jamnagar when i was in grade 7 i was miserable because i had to bid farewell to my friends in the previous town called dehu road and i found it hard to fit in socially at this new school however mr rathod and his history class got me through that year he refused to teach us history from the prescribed textbook instead he ordered us to use the school library to read about ancient and modern indian history from books and popular comics and then he asked each student to pick a topic and educate the class on what they had learned of course the rest of us were free to disagree with the presenter and mr rathod encouraged us to be methodical and logical in our arguments i distinctly remember a group of twelve year olds almost coming to blows when debating the british influence on india before meeting mr rathod history for me was objective undisputed unchanging before him every history teacher had drilled into me that there was only one correct answer to any question mr rathod taught us that most answers to questions ina history test should begin with it depends throughout grade 7 he showed us directly and indirectly that history can teach us less about who they were and much more about who we are the notion that we can all be great investors just by gauging history is nonsense it has been fundamental to our process but it works for us because of who we are so i bring my prejudices and biases to something as simple as a historical balance sheet oc casionally there are vehement disagreements on how to interpret the past it occurs even within our small well knit team which has worked together for many years in the middle of these fiery debates i often yearn for mr rathod why couldn t he be here to adjudicate this chapter summary evolutionary theory has taught me that we investors can reimagine investing by studying and understanding the history of a business and an industry instead of con stantly obsessing over the future 1 darwin the founder of modern evolutionary theory understood better than anyone before him that the present was the result of the cumulative effect of the past 2 he proposed his three groundbreaking theories natural selection sexual selection and common descent by construing history in a new light 3 unlike physics and chemistry the science of evolutionary biology does not make predictions rather than answering the question what will happen to humans it ponders over the conundrum how did bipedal humans evolve from an an cestral quadruped ape 4 the investment world is obsessed with the future studying history has taken a backseat to making bold forecasts 5 taking a leaf out of evolutionary biology we focus exclusively on widely and openly available historical information to ana lyze businesses we spend no time building projections and forecasts 6 we develop a point of view on company financials strategy competitive position and valuation by analyzing what has al ready happened without bothering about what will happen 7 however concentrating on the past does have two main downsides we may wrongly assume that 1 a historically success ful business will continue to be so or 2 a failed or failing business will continue to be so chapter6 bacteria and business replay the tape iam inclined to believe that in nearly the same way as two men have sometimes independently hit on the very same invention so natural selection working for the good of each being and taking advantage of analogous variations has sometimes modified in very nearly the same manner two parts in two organic beings which owe but little of their structure in common to inheritance from the same ancestor charles darwin on the origin of species chapter 6 difficulties of the theory

ownership of see s has taught us much about the evaluation of fran chises we ve made significant money in certain common stocks because of the lessons we learned at see s warren buffett annual letter to shareholders 1991 im cooper had no idea that that cold and windy saturday morning in a lab at michigan state university in january 2003 would be one of the most important of his life tim started performing his well rehearsed routine he had done it dozens of times over the past three years but he knew that he had to be very careful he was the experiment had been going for fourteen straight years and he was not going to be the one responsible for any mishap first he took a set of twelve new flasks and carefully measured exactly 9 9 milliliters of fluid into each next he went to the incubator and removed the twelve old flasks housing generation number 33 127 he would inoculate the new flasks with 0 1 milliliters of fluid from each of these twelve old flasks but he needed to check the old flasks first he picked up two of them and saw what he expected the next two flasks also seemed acceptable but in the third set of two flasks in the flask labeled ara 3 he saw that the fluid had turned opaque instead of being mildly cloudy like in the other old flasks that shouldn t have happened the lab had seen similar problems in the past owing to contamination there was a strict protocol for solving the issue and tim was well versed in it tim replaced the faulty old ara 3 flask and came back on sunday to check the outcome of course he expected the usual result but he was in for the same surprise the new ara 3 flask too had turned turbid something was very wrong or very right the astonishing anoles our investment strategy has an unusual feature we don t invest in individual businesses it may seem like we do but we don t what in the world do we invest in then let s do an evolutionary thought experiment to answer the question imagine another earth like planet that is at a similar distance from its sun like star this is not entirely improbable since there are a billion trillion 1021 stars in the universe would this planet evolve the same life forms as those on earth how likely is it to have honeysuckles and hornbills philosophers may have pondered this question for millennia but the first modern scientist to attempt an answer was the late harvard paleontologist and evolutionary biologist stephen jay gould in his excellent book wonderful life gould took the position that evolution was unpredictable replay the tape a million times and i doubt that anything like homo sapiens would ever evolve again if the evolutionary tape were replayed a million times each outcome would depend on two opposing forces on the one hand the nonrandom force of natural selection would ensure that organisms develop a small set of foreseeable solutions to the obstacles imposed on them by the environment on the other chance mutations and rare environmental events would make any kind of prediction impossible which would win the bad news is that we can t possibly perform the experiment gould mused the good news is that although we can t perform the experiment nature can and has do you want evidence let s start with lizards more than seven hundred caribbean islands are home to about one hundred and fifty species of lizard called anoles genus anolis all the caribbean species are the descendants of just two species that arrived from the mainland millions of years ago dr jonathan losos a professor of biology at washington university has been studying the anoles since the late 1980s on the four larger caribbean islands of cuba jamaica hispaniola and puerto rico professor losos discovered that the one hundred and fifty species across these four islands are broadly clustered into six groups or ecomorphs trunk twig crown giant trunk crown trunk ground and grass bush this classification rests on body length tail length limb length toe pad lamellae scales on the feet of the anoles that help them stick to a surface color and habitat for example the trunk ecomorph lives on tree trunks has an average body length of about five centimeters has a short tail and is gray a very different ecomorph the grass bush lives in the grasses and bush has an average body length of four centime ters has a very long tail and is brown the behavioral and physical traits of various anole ecomorphs have adapted very well to the anoles unique local environ ments thus the long tail of the grass bush ecomorph helps the anole achieve spectacular balance on narrow and unstable sur faces like blades of grass and its brown color melds with the color of the bush and grasses the trunk ecomorph is very different because it has a solid tree trunk underneath its feet for most of its life it does not need a long tail for balance but it does need its gray color which can provide camouflage against the gray tree trunk thereby fooling its predators and prey the twig anole has short legs to help it navigate the small twigs on which it lives finally the trunk ground ecomorph has evolved long legs to run efficiently on tree trunks and the ground no surprises here darwinian natural selection is alive and well on the gorgeous islands of the caribbean what is surprising however is that the same ecomorphs are seen across the four islands thus the trunk ecomorph in cuba looks and behaves very similarly to the trunk ecomorph in hispaniola and the crown giant ecomorph in puerto rico is indistin guishable from the one in jamaica i know what you are thinking are the trunk anoles the same species that colonized cuba and hispaniola dna analysis has demonstrated that they aren t the six ecomorph anoles on the island of cuba are much more closely related to one another than they are to anoles on other islands thus the trunk anoles in cuba are much more closely related to the twig anoles in cuba than to the trunk anoles in hispaniola the anoles living on tree trunks on the islands of cuba and hispaniola are very different species but have developed the same physical and behavioral characteristics on encountering similar environments this is true for all six ecomorphs when presented with a specific problem the caribbean anoles on different islands have evolved the same solutions such as tail length body length and color amazingly they have done it independently of one another the anoles are a textbook example of evolutionary convergence wherein unrelated organisms in similar environments develop the same body form and adaptations independently 2 convergence is ubiquitous the fascinating example of convergence in caribbean anoles is a rule not an exception in the natural world dolphins are mammals just like us and sharks are fish but their fusiform body shapes are pretty similar and more inter estingly they have the same coloration both have a light underbelly and darker back making them harder to spot from above and below george mcghee a paleontologist claims that the reason sharks dolphins tuna and the extinct ichthyosaur look alike is that there is only one way for a fast swimming animal to evolve 3 in vertebrates powered flight evolved in birds bats and the now extinct pterosaurs their common ancestor a land based quadruped had no wings their wings appear to be the same but they have evolved separately and independently in all three the forearms have been modified into wings and all take or took to the sky in the same way by flapping their wings downward to create upward lift and forward movement australia punches much above its weight in the sporting world this nation of only twenty five million people won 547 medals in the summer olympics before tokyo 2020 exceeding many nations much more significant in population for exam ple its medal tally is one fifth that of the united states whose population is thirteen times larger now is not the time or place for me to comment on india s medal tally sport is not the only thing that makes this country or continent if you prefer unique australia was part of the supercon tinent pangea and its southern segment gondwanaland which started breaking apart about 180 million years ago as a result australia has been a free standing continent for about 35 million years the mammals on this massive island have been taking a unique evolutionary path during this time the australian mammals are all marsupials who give birth to undeveloped young ones and raise them in an external pouch most of the world has placental mammals like us who give birth to fully developed infants does the dramatic difference in their life histories and development process mean that marsupials look very different from the placentals surprisingly not compare the images of the australian marsupials to those of the placentals in figure 6 1 if we were to place them next to one another it would not be easy to differentiate a wolf from the now extinct thylacine the mouse from the mulgara or the mar mot from the wombat they look similar despite being unrelated genetically because they have solved a similar problem in a simi lar way in vastly different regions of the world 6 1 the stark convergence between placental mammals a wolf b mouse and c marmot and marsupial mammals d thylacine e mul gara and f wombat sources a and f courtesy of wikimedia commons b c 4 and e licensed from science photo library now let s take the example of a niche predator that preys mainly on termites how would you design such an organism what traits should it possess i assume you will agree that it should have a long and sticky tongue to trap and eat termites it should have solid front claws for digging into termite mounds its head should be small and it should have a long snout that can enter termite mounds with ease congratulations you have designed the marsupial anteater called the numbat as well as the placental anteater as you may expect they look surprisingly alike through convergence they have developed a similar appear ance and body parts without having a close common ancestor because both needed to solve the problem of how to eat termites charles darwin recognized the power of convergence when he asserted animals belonging to two most distinct lines of descent may readily become adapted to similar conditions and thus assume a close external resemblance 2 darwin was right but not entirely so convergence is ubiquitous and not limited just to the external appearance or morphology of animals it is also widely ob served and documented in animal behavior and in plants fungi and even bacteria let s start with behavior what do you think these four species a cobra a stickleback fish an octopus and a spider share there is no convergence in body form here unlike the caribbean anoles but a behavior has converged among them that has led to the success of each of their species the females of the species guard their eggs one of the best examples of convergent behavior is observed in humans and hold your breath ants and i have witnessed this convergence with my own eyes when i was on a family vacation in the stunningly beautiful peruvian amazon i stumbled upon the tiny creatures that had beaten our human ancestors to the discovery of agriculture by many millions of years the leaf cutter ants ihad waited years to witness the miracle and there it was in its full linear glory a long single column of thousands of large green leaves appeared to be miraculously moving in perfect synchrony of their own volition on the forest floor each large leaf was being carried by a single tiny ant who purposefully disappeared underground to pass on the booty to her specialist sisters these ants chew the leaves to grow a fungus garden used for food for the entire colony not unlike human farmers these ants produce fertilizers amino acids and enzymes to aid the fungal growth remove contaminants that can hinder the agricultural output are highly selective in what they grow and continuously tend to their enormous gardens and just as agriculture helped us become the dominant species on this planet leafcutter ants have become the dominant herbivores of the new world they consume close to one sixth of all leaves produced in tropical forests humans and leafcutter ants have solved their food problems by converging toward a similar solution crossing time and species boundaries let s move on to plants most of us have had coffee tea and chocolate derived from cacao the brazilians among us will be familiar with the drink guarana antarctica made from the guaran plant in the amazon rainforest all four plants produce the same chemical desired by humans a purine alkaloid called 1 3 7 trimethylpurine 2 6 dione in short caffeine 2 these four plants may seem to be closely related but they aren t the common ancestor of tea and coffee dates back a hundred million years cacao is more closely related to maple and eucalyptus trees than to tea and coffee bizarrely the ancestor of coffee gave rise to potatoes and tomatoes but not tea plants have many defense mechanisms against predators and it appears that some have converged toward the same solution producing caffeine many plants rely on birds to pollinate their flowers so if a plant depends on hummingbirds for pollination what should it do develop red flowers because red is attractive to hummingbirds consequently eighteen types of plants that hummingbirds pollinate have evolved bright red flowers other plants have developed a different strategy one that exploits flies and beetles penchant for laying eggs on smelly decomposing carcasses seven types of plants including the corpse lily and the zulu giant or carrion flower have evolved to produce a smell that resembles rotting meat the odor fools the insects and while visiting the plants to lay their eggs they transfer pollen from one flower to another 12 i could go on and on to fill this book with examples of convergent evolution in the natural world but scientists now agree that convergence is the rule not an exception in nature this sentiment is best expressed by the most famous advocate of con vergence the cambridge paleontologist simon conway morris who has written two books on the subject he has explained convergence by saying certainly it s not the case that every earth like planet will have life let alone humanoids but if you want a sophisticated plant it will look awfully like a flower if you want a fly there are only a few ways you can do that if you want to swim like a shark there are only a few ways you can do that if you want to invent warm bloodedness like birds and mammals there are only a few ways to do that convergence in nature symbolizes a profound fact there is a pattern to success and failure what can the caribbean anole the crest tailed marsupial mouse and caffeine teach us about investing convergence in business symbolizes a profound fact there is a pattern to success and failure we don t invest in individual businesses earlier in the chapter i made the following assertion about our investment strategy we don t invest in individual businesses it may seem like we do but we don t so what in the world do we invest in then we invest in convergent patterns we seek patterns that repeat as we saw replaying the tape of life often yields the same result we operate on the principle that the business world is no different there is a big difference between asserting i love this business and i love this business construct we are fans of the latter not the former we don t care about a business we are deeply attached to a business template not unlike the natural world which converges toward a small subset of answers to the same questions we have seen that companies around the globe behave in similar ways when facing a similar environment not always but often enough we have benefited enormously by asking this simple convergence question up front have we seen this pattern elsewhere the cost of ignoring patterns as usual is best demonstrated through a painful personal experience in 1999 or 2000 an investment bank showed us a hot private equity deal there was a lot of interest from many investors or so the bank led us to believe the company processed credit cards and had shown modest growth over the past few years un surprisingly the investment bank s projections showed dramatic growth starting the following year skeptical initially i met the management team and talked to industry participants and investors in the business then after reviewing india s low credit card penetration rates i convinced myself that while the management s and the bank s projections were aggressive they weren t too far off the mark so we invested in the business at a fancy valuation i wasn t wrong i was catastrophically wrong the company did not meet its projections for more than five years the j curve growth never arrived i want to emphasize that this was neither the bank s nor the management s fault they were doing their job but unfortunately i forgot to do mine a few years after this disaster when i looked back at the projections i realized that we would have saved our precious capital if i had applied the principle of convergence by asking a few simple questions the questions i should have asked but did not were as follows sure credit card penetration is low in india but so is penetration for every consumer product what other consumer products in india have seen these growth rates over the long term do you have examples of other countries where we have seen such rapid credit card growth if so was their stage of development similar to india s today i should have demanded a conver gent template but i didn t let s see what happens when we do we invested in info edge in late 2013 it runs india s leading job site naukri com and is led by sanjeev bikhchandani and hitesh oberoi two of the most well regarded entrepreneurs in india we did not invest in naukri because of sanjeev and hitesh but because of the convergent patterns naukri represents naukri allows job seeking candidates to post their résumés for free and charges companies a subscription fee to access these and list job vacancies when we invested in 2013 naukri had a dominant 65 percent traffic share and was four times larger than the second player monster india given naukri s dominance if you are a job seeker in india you would almost certainly post your résumé there if you are a company trying to hire you are almost compelled to subscribe to naukri because it has the most exten sive and diverse pool of candidates it is emblematic of the classic network effect naukri is number one because it is number one our confidence in info edge was high because it represents not one but two convergent patterns first the erstwhile yellow pages business many of you have probably never heard of this life saving invention but they were my lifeline until the early 1990s yellow pages were a fixture in every home just like a television or a refrigerator in the era of rotary landline phones before the age of the internet and mobile phones yellow pages were ungainly thick telephone directories usually printed on yellow paper that listed local businesses and their goods or services on offer yellow pages could give you a list of tens even hundreds of options whether you were looking for a language teacher a plumber a wedding planner a car dealer or a recording studio the directory was distributed free to the consumers and busi nesses paid a fee to be listed as a result the largest yellow pages business in any city or region was usually highly profitable be cause of the virtual monopoly enjoyed by their network effect consumers went to them because they listed the largest number of businesses and businesses subscribed to them because they attracted the largest number of consumers they were highly defensible businesses and for the leading companies the network effect ensured high profits over long periods it was not unusual for leading yellow pages businesses to earn a profit margin in excess of 40 percent while naukri op erates in a different era in a different medium our view was that it converged with many of the virtuous traits of a leading yellow pages business the second convergent pattern we noted was the performance of the leading internet job boards in other countries this pattern was even more powerful than that of yellow pages we found at least seven other job boards globally with obscenely high operating margins more than 30 to 40 percent and infinite roce just like naukri for example seek in australia dice and career builder in the united states 5 1job in china en in japan 104 corp in taiwan and jobstreet in singapore and malaysia these dom inant franchises became more dominant each year their margin and return profile kept improving they were all cash machines the number two in any of these markets showed no signs of catching up and linkedin and offline competitors had no impact on them in other words they were indistinguishable from naukri when we first encountered a 49 percent operating margin and infinite roce for naukri we were skeptical who earns that kind of money but after studying the yellow pages and companies in other markets we concluded that this was no fluke in 2021 naukri s operating margin was 55 percent we invested in naukri not just because sanjeev and hitesh are impressive folks which they are or because naukri makes gobs of money which it does or because it has annihilated the competition which it has instead we invested in naukri because the convergent models of yellow pages and global job board businesses gave us the confidence to believe that the naukri template is tough to beat make that almost impossible to beat i will state two counterfactuals to highlight the importance of this method of investing first what if sanjeev and hitesh impressive as they are were operating the number 2 or 3 job board in india we would not have touched the business winner takes all in the classifieds business and we would never have bet against that pattern second what if sanjeev and hitesh had come to us in the early days of the internet when there was no proof of concept for this business model again we would have walked away because the answer to the question where else has this worked would have been no idea nevertheless some venture capitalists did fund naukri in its early days kudos to them they recognized the genius of san jeev and hitesh and deserved their mouthwatering returns we detest the phrases this time it s different and my gut tells me this will work we need to see the evidence that our investment thesis has worked elsewhere if it hasn t we are unlikely to touch it we are the antithesis of the venture capital com munity which earns its living by betting on untested and unproven businesses i am in awe of successful venture capital firms but my admiration for them will never translate into a desire to emulate them kahneman s outside view and convergence ihave learned to invest by investing and by observing other investors i wish i could have learned from the learned finance and economics academics have you tried reading a finance journal or research article on economics or finance i have and i must admit i can t understand most of them they are inundated with greek symbols complicated mathematical equations and eso teric arguments they leave me baffled as to their utility for actual practitioners like me but occasionally one of the intellectuals will take my breath away daniel kahneman is one such individual his masterpiece thinking fast and slow should be compulsory reading for all investing 101 classes if you are already an investor there is no more valuable chapter to read and re read than chapter 23 the outside view here kahneman describes his experience of leading a team in israel designing a curriculum and writing a textbook for high school students on judgment and decision making after a year the team had made reasonable progress they had prepared a de tailed outline of the syllabus written a couple chapters and conducted some classroom lessons one day kahneman asked his colleagues to write down an estimate of the time it would take the team to submit a finished textbook draft to the ministry of education everyone on the team including kahneman s colleague seymour fox an expert in curriculum development estimated that it would take them about two years kahneman then asked fox who had witnessed many other teams develop similar textbooks and curricula over the years how long it usually takes teams to finish their textbook projects fox s answer stunned kahneman seemingly embarrassed fox admitted that 40 percent of such teams never finished the task and those who did took anywhere from seven to ten years the actual time it took kahneman s team eight years a far cry from the two years they had estimated kahneman labels the team s initial estimate of two years the inside view it was based on the team members specific cir cumstances their confidence in their abilities an extrapolation based on recent goals achieved and a hazy idea of the future and it was wrong by a wide margin kahneman calls the 40 percent failure estimate of similar projects and the completion time of seven to ten years the outside view as he describes his questioning of fox revealed two great insights first although fox was aware of the outside view he did not even consider it while initially writing down his estimate and second although the other team members including kahne man did not have access to the information fox did none even attempted to understand the outside view when the project began but applying convergent thinking or an outside view is neither natural nor easy as kahneman himself states succinctly pallid statistical information is routinely discarded when it is incompatible with one s personal impression of a case in the com petition with the inside view the outside view does not stand a chance the outside view does not have a chance in the investment community because ironically fund managers and analysts are savvy given a choice between applying their intellectual horsepower to a single business by making a ten year projection of profits or stepping back and asking if any of it even makes sense brilliant folks often choose the former as i was transitioning from consulting in my early investing days i was the biggest believer in the myth that more work produces better answers for in vestors it doesn t let me illustrate the power of kahneman s outside view by outlining two ways of analyzing a potential investment in an airline imagine that i have just flown to singapore from new york aboard the tiber comfortable a380 in january 2019 ihave thoroughly enjoyed the legendary singapore airlines service after i land i pick up a financial newspaper and read an interesting article on the enormous potential for airlines in asia particularly in india and china this article also informs me that the famous tata group in india launched not one but two airlines a few years ago the journalist gushes about the limitless growth possibili ties on the continent having just had a great flying experience and feeling excited about the potential of the fast growing asian airline market i decide to start some serious work on the subject to evaluate an investment in an asian airline if you are not from the finance industry please do not treat this as a frivolous example believe it or not this is how fund managers sometimes get interested in companies at first glance there is a lot to like about the airline industry but to a fund manager s ears i can describe it in two words that sound better than beethoven s symphony large and growing unless you live in a monastery in a remote corner of the world your life in the modern world directly or indirectly is touched by the airline industry and the industry is beginning to impact africa and asia the phenomenal growth of dubai and singapore as airline hubs during the last decade is testimony to the region s potential at this stage i have two options 1 perform a detailed analysis of one asian airline or 2 focus on understanding the outside view of the airline industry if i choose option one which incidentally many fund managers choose i will waste my time doing the following time con suming and futile tasks my team and i will interview the ceo and cfo at a fancy restaurant then we will visit their corporate offices where the senior management team will wax eloquent on the culture and systems of their unique airline finally we will read tens of ana lyst reports most of which will be favorable do you seriously expect an airline analyst to denigrate their industry and we will build a fancy excel spreadsheet with multiyear forecasts of fuel prices passenger miles average ticket prices load factors gross margins capital expenditures inventory levels lease costs personnel expenses marketing costs airport charges freight revenues and heaven knows what else the result after many weeks or months of meetings and late nights we will either buy or choose a price at which we plan to purchase the company s shares if we think the price is too high let s see what we would do if we were to choose option two instead we want to analyze the industry in greater depth and so we start with an extensive study conducted by mit on the u s airline industry from 2000 to 2013 the conclusions of this study are in an eighty one page document available for free on the in ternet 12 the results are humbling surprisingly despite being a mature market the u s industry grew during this period the revenue of passenger miles grew about 20 percent from 709 million to 848 million however on total revenue of about 1 4 trillion during this period the airlines made a cumulative loss of 44 billion thus on an annual revenue of close to 100 billion the airline industry lost about 3 billion every year from 2000 to 2013 but these averages hide an even sorrier story during eight of these fourteen years or almost 60 percent of the time the airlines made no money that is they declared financial losses or only a meager profit and in the six years they did manage to eke out profits their total net profit was only about 40 billion however the real tragedy is that during just two bad years 2005 and 2008 the industry suffered losses of 54 billion or 14 billion more than the cumulative profits of 40 billion during the entire period it is generally assumed that the tragedy of sep tember 11 2001 was terrible for the airline industry which is true u s airlines suffered losses of about 19 billion in 2001 and 2002 but in 2005 four years after the tragedy and three years before the financial meltdown of 2008 the industry declared a total net loss of 28 billion far exceeding the losses resulting from september 11 the remarkable consistency with which airlines lose money is not a problem unique to the united states a report from the international air transport association shows that from 2000 to 2014 the industry had not earned its cost of capital for fifteen years in a row 2 not even ina single year you must now be thinking what i am thinking the industry may be destructive overall but what about the top airlines would they not be much better than the industry let s look at the return profiles of the top ten airlines by revenue in the world according to aviation week lufthansa all nippon southwest qantas air china american singapore turk hava aeroflot and ryanair using morningstar i calculated their return on equity roe and return on assets roa for ten years from 2004 to 2013 and the results are terrible the median roe of these airlines over ten years was 6 8 percent and the median roa was 2 5 percent scale does not guarantee success in this demanding industry to sum it up it s as bad as it gets after studying the historical patterns in the airline industry we can conclude the following with a high degree of confi dence 1 us airlines do not make money 2 the global airline industry does not make money 3 the top ten airlines in the world do not make money the detailed and unfortunate outside view of the industry is quite troubling airlines are great for consumers not for investors this pessimistic view advises us to stay away from the airline industry instead we should choose to invest our excess cash in a bank deposit rather than buying a single airline share iam sure many of you are now asking the obvious question can one make a decision about investing in an asian airline based on learnings from u s and global airlines if we can conclude that asia is not dissimilar to the united states maybe we can get comfortable with the fact that the fate of asian airlines will be no different from their u s counterparts at first glance the in dustry may appear to be quite different in asia owing to ownership and international routes first most airlines in asia including singapore airlines are owned by the government unlike in the united states where airlines are under private ownership second most of the heavy traffic routes in asia are between international destinations not domestic ones there are no domestic flights in singapore or dubai but if we dig a bit deeper into the competitive dynamics we may conclude that asia is no different from the united states in the prepandemic days expedia showed that if you wanted to fly from singapore to new york you could choose from among twenty two airlines competition is no less severe just because the flights are international as opposed to domestic the airline rivalry in asia may be more intense than in the united states owing to the ownership structure since governments care much less about economics than private investors they may not be perturbed by continued financial losses moreover most countries seem to treat their airline as a national symbol so shutting down a national airline as prudent as it may be for the exchequer is unheard of in asia as a result in my view invoking convergence to understand the asian airline industry is a legitimate invest ment approach in this case applying the outside view to investing yielded us two significant benefits first we avoided investing in a com pany and in an industry in which the odds of making money are very slim indeed i am not suggesting that it is impossible to make money by investing in airlines if you bought an airline stock at a low enough price no i can t define what is low enough and then were lucky enough to sell it at some profit good for you but i will find a greater fool for my crappy asset is another way to say speculating not investing it s not for us the second benefit was the time money and effort saved instead of conducting lengthy and unproductive management meetings schmoozing the investor relations person paying fat fees to consultants and spending weeks to construct a multi megabyte excel spreadsheet we spent a few hours on the internet downloaded a few reports and made our decision within a few minutes with enough time left to go home early to our families some practical ways of applying the principle of convergence this discussion on airlines should not lead anyone to believe that all will be well just by applying the principle of convergence or the outside view to a specific investment situation convergence is not a panacea nor is it a substitute for thoughtful analysis and synthesis but when applied wisely it can be a powerful investment tool i don t know about the rest of the world but in india a married person inherits their spouse s family whether they like it or not the likelihood of getting along with your spouse over the long term is relatively low if you don t like your spouse s first sec ond and occasionally even third cousins for the record my in laws are the best investing in companies is no different buying into a business means also buying into the industry of that business for example while i may think am investing in a company that makes and sells sanitaryware i am inheriting all the good and the bad of the sanitaryware industry no company is an island we can never ignore the kinds of businesses that surround it one of our principles of convergence investing is that if the industry allows its companies to make money consistently we love it if not we better have a perfect reason for spending even one minute analyzing a business like an airline life is too short there are three potential answers to the question of an industry s attractiveness and profitability first is that the companies in the industry struggle to keep their heads above water just as we saw in the case of airlines industries like telecom towers gar ment manufacturing and commodity chemicals are notorious value destroyers most companies in these industries barely earn their cost of capital as i have said repeatedly one of the immensely underappreciated values of any strategy including an invest ment strategy is what it advises us not to do the principle of convergence demands that i avoid investing in these industries if most companies in the industry can t hack it why should i believe that this company is unique the second conclusion could be that the industry is uniformly attractive for its participants for example companies like accenture cognizant infosys and tcs in the information technology it outsourcing industry earn more than 40 to 50 percent roce and have been doing so for decades if you accept convergence investing as we do you should love assessing companies in the it industry for example when we evaluated an investment in mindtree india s leading midtier it services business we knew that the company had been very profitable for many years but how could we be sure that it would continue to be successful by witnessing the convergent outcomes of other businesses in the industry all of which had been able to scale their revenues over many decades without sacrificing profitability in other words it happened there so all else being equal there was a high probabil ity that it could happen here my optimistic view does not mean that i will invest in any company in the it services industry instead my actual invest ment will depend on factors like valuation financial risk management track record capital allocation customer concentration market share and so on but the companies in this industry would be right on top of my radar as mindtree was you may think these industries that churn money spinners would be rare at least that is what microeconomic theory would espouse but they aren t our portfolio is full of companies in desirable industries enzymes paints cookers business process outsourcing bearings compressors consumer electricals sanitaryware and steam turbines to name just a few last convergence can inform us that only some companies make money in specific industries whereas most others don t for example walking along fifth avenue in manhattan i am dazzled by the brilliance and splendor of fashion stores but fashion is a brutal place to be in very few companies grow revenues and profits steadily most are shooting stars that shine for a few mo ments and then disappear into oblivion the same is true for retailers and restaurants these are the trickiest companies for us to assess should we bet on a single business in an unattractive industry or should we just walk away if we evaluate a company in these industries which we rarely do we are exceptionally demanding we will not invest in anyone but the undisputed leader we use the principle of convergence across many other areas of business apart from assessing industry attractiveness we use it much more often to figure out what not to do i want to take you back to chapter 1 which focused exclusively on the importance of avoiding significant risks i contended that avoiding risky investments is more important and more difficult for most investors than making good investments as a quick reminder i highlighted six types of businesses we avoid at all costs 1 those owned and run by crooks 2 turnaround situations 3 those with high levels of debt 4 m a junkies 5 those in fast changing industries 6 those with unaligned owners how did i arrive at this list through a combination of reliving bad experiences 1 2 and 5 doing some factual data anal ysis 4 5 and 6 watching others stumble 2 3 and 6 and learning from owners of portfolio companies 4 and 5 the common thread through all of these was the hunger for detecting patterns and seeking a convergence of outcomes investors can detect or manufacture a vast range of patterns across businesses this is not the place to discuss all of them instead this chapter intends to make the simple claim that one of the most important questions an investor can ask is where else has this worked before moving on let me discuss one more aspect of convergence investing that i think has been critical to our success we are price sensitive the median trailing price earnings pe ratio for our portfolio at the time of our investment is less than 15 when the indian market has been about 19 to 20 we have rarely ever paid more than twenty times trailing pe most im portantly we have never said this is such a great business that even 30 pe is justified as i have made clear in previous chapters we have no interest in investing in low quality or mediocre businesses at any price our portfolio companies are truly stellar based on verifiable empirical data on historical financials industry market share balance sheet quality and customer satisfaction moreover the markets are generally quite efficient businesses like these are rarely available at a throwaway price since we have chosen to invest exclusively in world class businesses we have two options 1 invest at a high valuation hoping that the price will rise further or 2 stay inactive for long periods until we get the price we want we have always chosen option two why convergence valuation matters for equity returns over the long run across years countries and the size of companies the lower the valuation the higher the prospective long term returns it has worked every where over very long periods so who are we to defy it there is a lot of empirical research on equity valuation and returns the article on this topic that i like best is value and growth investing review and update by louis k c chan and josef lakonishok 4 i love this article for two reasons first it isa meta research article that summarizes the conclusions of many other researchers over many years across several countries sec ond while chan and lakonishok are both academics from the university of illinois at urbana champaign lakonishok is also the ceo and chief investment officer of a 100 billion fund called lsv asset management it s always good to hear from people whose research conclusions matter to their bank balance the article has many tables with reams of data and if you don t have much time i suggest focusing on table 2 it shows re turns over twenty years from 1975 to 1995 across thirteen countries for value stocks those with low valuation and glamour stocks those with high valuation across four valuation measures the results are stark the value portfolio beats the glamour portfolio across almost all countries and the outperformance is not trivial it ranges from 1 5 percentage points for switzerland to 6 7 percentage points for the united states based on pe ratio as the valuation measure the first paragraph of their conclusion is worth repeating in full a large body of empirical research indicates that value stocks on average earn higher returns than growth stocks the re ward to value investing is more pronounced for small cap stocks but it is also present in large cap stocks the value premium exists also in equity markets outside the united states why should we risk investing at high valuations when we know that the result will be poor on average some of you may de tect a paradox here unlike lsv asset management which relies on sophisticated quantitative analysis we do in depth qualitative research on industries and businesses as a result we know a lot about our portfolio companies and their industries given that we have an informed view of them should we not be willing to pay up when the opportunity arises no why because i have more respect for the convergence theme with respect to valuation and potential returns than my intel lect i wish i were more intelligent but iam not we now arrive at an obvious question under what situations should we not apply the principle of convergence not as straightforward as it sounds someone wise reputed to be einstein but there is no agreement once remarked everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler life is complicated and so is investing the principle of convergence may seem intelligible i hope and its implementation a cinch sorry to disappoint you but this seemingly easy to use tool generates its own set of thorny issues give me a conclusion you desire and i am reasonably confident that i would rationalize it based on the principle of conver gence a couple of anecdotes may masquerade as a pattern one pattern can be ignored in favor of another or one can simply resort to telling a story that seems to weave in an outside view where there is none if you are an investor or choose to be one you will need to learn your lessons the hard way however here are some pointers based on my experience the probability of convergent evolution is higher in living organisms if they share similarities in genetics development and ecology unsurprisingly the greater the similarity of conditions in businesses the greater is the benefit of using the principle of convergence in investing conditions here could mean industry structure geography competitive dynamics stage of busi ness the similarity of business models and much more for example we saw that the caribbean anoles were endowed with the same physical attributes when conditions were similar across the islands therefore businesses should operate under the same principle let me take the example of three types of businesses to explain the complications of applying the principle of convergence assume that i am evaluating an investment in a company that builds residential properties in germany to incorporate an outside view i would start with developing an understanding of the dynamics of the german residential property market the industry participants track record of growth and profitability extent of consolidation and anything else that would get me smart on the overall german residential market i would prefer not to draw parallels with germany s commercial or retail real estate mar ket because the industry structure and types of players are usually different across these segments should i study the french spanish or brazilian residential real estate market it depends whether these other markets have a similar industry structure to that of germany e g is the industry fragmented or consolidated or whether the regulations are primarily comparable e g if a government subsidizes mortgage payments for its citizens it will dramatically affect consumer behavior intuitively given the cultural and historical affinity of the french and spanish residential markets i would be more inclined to draw lessons from those markets and not brazil s but maybe someone can find a way to draw lessons even from brazil what about the u s residential real estate market i am not sure i would need to do some work to understand if there are any par allels between germany and the united states take the case of a german company manufacturing industrial robots these robots are supplied to manufacturing busi nesses across the world since this is a global business i would not worry too much about the german angle here instead i would research enterprises supplying the same or similar equipment worldwide whether based in china italy or singapore to under stand their growth profitability and trends in market share i would also go one level higher to analyze the performance of global businesses that supply sophisticated industrial machinery i may not assign as much weight to this second analysis but i would study it to discern any apparent trends if available some of you may argue that i was too quick to dismiss the german engineering businesses in general maybe something about german engineering strength can serve as a template for an industrial robot business i am skeptical but perhaps you are right so go ahead and do the work third take the case of a german hospital business should we use convergent investing by assessing the economics and in dustry structure of hospitals in the united kingdom italy and the netherlands health care in most markets is heavily regulated and this may significantly impact the economics of a hospital it would be too cumbersome to assess the impact of local laws on the hospitals in each country instead we could use a shortcut to see if the overall hospital economics or those of the top five to ten hospitals if industry data are unavailable are comparable across countries since hospitals are a services business can we use the information from other german services sectors say hotels to refine our assessment think about it one situation in which we never apply convergence is when the industry is new or fast changing convergent evolution is more evident in plants and insects since they have been around on earth longer than birds and mammals it takes time for con vergence to emerge this fact is equally applicable to the world of business we have noticed greater convergence in older industries e g paint garments engines turbines cars and less in newer ones e g virtual reality robotics electric vehicles biotechnology industries converge toward similar fates after the companies have had enough time to plan and execute their strategies after winners and losers have been essentially decided and when the pace of change has declined thus if we are exploring an investment in a paint company in germany it would be helpful to study the paint industry in the western world but if we were in the year 2000 drawing parallels from the u s e commerce industry for an investment in a chinese e retailer may have been taking things a bit too far as you can see convergence investing is not an objective bias free mathematical endeavor that always yields the same answer as a result you may have a different view of one or more of my conclusions and therein lies all the fun and frustration of investing this brings us back to tim cooper and the mysteriously turbid ara 3 flask lessons from lenski on february 24 1988 professor richard lenski seeded twelve sterile flasks containing ten milliliters of glucose solution with the common bacterium escherichia coli commonly called e coli lenski had started an experiment that continues today and has yielded hundreds of research articles dozens of doctorates and global acclaim 12 he started an experiment on long term evolution like the one conducted on silver foxes by lyudmila trut and dmitri belyaev but with two key differences first he wanted to use microscopic organisms that have a generation time of only twenty minutes thereby allowing tens of thousands of generations to evolve over a human lifetime second unlike the artificial selection experiments on foxes or dogs or wheat in which the experimenter chooses who or what reproduces lenski wanted the experi mental environment to choose when the experiment started all twelve flasks had genetically the same e coli since all cells came from the same mother cell each flask contained hundreds of millions of bacteria so there was ample opportunity for mutations to emerge an essential experimental twist was that food was in limited supply every day the e coli population increased for about six hours until the glucose was exhausted at this point the bacteria would stop dividing and wait the next day a lab member someone like tim cooper would take 0 1 milliliters out of each flask 1 percent of the flask s content and inoculate a new flask containing 9 9 milliliters of fresh glucose solution a new cycle would then begin until the next day when the same procedure would be repeated and the next day week after week month after month year after year lenski was replaying gould s proverbial tape of life simultaneously in twelve flasks he wasn t selecting the bacteria and he wasn t varying the medium instead he was letting life run its course in parallel over thousands of generations what he found was remarkable in 2011 after fifty thousand generations of evolution he said to my surprise evolution was pretty repeat able although the lineages certainly diverged in many details i was struck by the parallel trajectories of their evolution with similar changes in so many phenotypic traits and even gene sequences we examined it wasn t that the bacteria had not evolved on the contrary they had evolved a lot the e coli in different flasks adapted differently to the starvation diet by either growing faster or becoming more numerous than earlier generations but the general trend was unmistakable on average the population grew 70 percent faster than their founding ancestors in addition the re searchers found another example of convergent evolution all twelve populations of bacteria had lost the ability to synthesize a sugar called d ribose because all had undergone the same set of genetic changes unlike gould s prediction the replaying of the tape of life was yielding the same result until one day fifteen years after the start of the experiment tim cooper found that it didn t the reason the ara 3 flask had turned opaque was that unlike the other flasks it had experienced a population explosion the ara 3 population was ten times the size of the populations in the other flasks how could this have happened when all flasks had only a limited amount of glucose the ara 3 bacteria had developed the ability to feed on some other ingredient in the solution the only other candidate was a molecule called citrate present in all glucose solutions from day one however at the time of the beginning of the experiment e coli was explicitly known not to synthesize citrate in the presence of oxygen therefore this inability was used to identify whether a type of bacteria was e coli or not the 33 127th generation of lenski s bacteria had deviated drastically from the clean and simple story of inevitable conver gence it was as big a case of divergence as biology had ever seen experimentally lenski s lab later found that the ability of the ara 3 bacteria to digest citrate resulted from a series of mutations after about twenty thousand generations unfortunately each muta tion was rare so no bacteria in any of the other flasks have developed this ability it is worth paying attention to the two critical lessons from lenski s long term experiment 1 convergence is the dominant pattern in the natural world 2 on rare occasions it isn t we can replace just one word to derive the same two critical lessons for us investors 1 convergence is the dominant pattern in the business world 2 on rare occasions it isn t i have been singing the praises of convergence as a powerful investing tool which it is of course there are only a few ways for businesses to succeed as investors identifying a convergent pattern of success or failure has helped us make what we think are some excellent investments and avoid many bad ones but i have also reached a painful realization that patterns can break and a successful ara 3 type mutant can arise occasion ally unfortunately we would miss an opportunity to invest in it if one replays the tape of business history across periods and countries the overwhelming convergent pattern would be that business focus leads to success most of our portfolio comprises businesses with only one product or service or a small set of re lated products and services we refuse to invest in diversified companies or conglomerates we also express disappointment when any of our management teams try to deviate from their course if i were an investor in the united states i would have missed amazon by adhering to this investment philosophy amazon has a market value of about one trillion dollars this business started as an electronic book retailer and diversified into an ever growing list of offerings many of which have almost nothing to do with one another you can watch a movie on prime video after reading its review in a magazine bought on kindle you can be attired in com fortable amazon essentials when you order milk and eggs through amazon fresh delivery by talking to alexa amazon logistics will deliver your groceries and announce their arrival at your doorstep via ring while playing amazon music you can earn some money by completing a mechanical turk survey hosted on amazon web services and you can be a citizen of any of the fifty eight countries globally with amazon s presence if ara 3 had a brain it would have been intensely jealous of jeff bezos who seems to have broken every business rule to out mutate the ultimate mutant in 2017 warren buffett admitted on cnbc s squawk box that he should have invested in amazon i have no such qualms i know that i would have missed amazon in the past and i will miss an amazon like business in the future so be it the only saving grace of this failure i doubt i will see another bezos in my lifetime 2k when i advocate convergence investing i admit my incompetence i am effectively saying i don t know how to assess this particular business maybe this is why the approach of taking the outside or convergent view while being straightforward is not followed as widely as it should be yet since 2007 we have kept doing what we love asking questions that lead us to companies patterns of success and failure in our profession getting the correct answer is easy but unfortunately asking the right question is not chapter summary evolutionary theory has taught me that an important element of reimagining investing is internalizing the recurring patterns of success and failure in the business world 1 convergence unrelated organisms developing the same solutions to similar problems is ubiquitous in nature it is seen across animals plants fungi and even bacteria in nature every problem seems to have only a small set of solutions 2 for example australia s flora and fauna has been evolving independently of those of the rest of the world for more than thirty five million years when australia became a separate continent but for every australian marsupial there seems to be a placental counterpart 3 the business world too is convergent there are definitive patterns to the success and failure of companies we exploit this property of the corporate world to select outstanding businesses and reject lousy ones by asking a simple question where else have we seen this 4 we are investors not in individual businesses but in proven and successful templates of businesses 5 we are big fans of daniel kahneman s outside view which is conceptually similar to convergence and compels us to seek similar patterns elsewhere before making an investment decision 6 however applying the principle of convergence is tricky because we humans can see patterns where none exist we can also miss out on one off opportunities like amazon that seem to defy the convergent notion that focus is the key to success chapter7 don t confuse a green frog for a guppy the sexes of many animals incessantly call for each other during the breeding season and not in a few cases the male endeavours thus to charm or excite the female this indeed seems to have been the primeval use and means of development of the voice as i have attempted to show in my descent of man charles darwin the expression of emotion in man and animals chapter 4 means of expression in animals fechheimer is exactly the sort of business we like to buy its economic record is superb you may be amused to know that neither charlie nor i have been to cincinnati headquarters for fechheimer to see their operation if our success were to depend upon insights we de veloped through plant inspections berkshire would be in big trouble rather in considering an acquisition we attempt to evaluate the eco nomic characteristics of the business its competitive strengths and weaknesses and the quality of people we will be joining warren buffett annual letter to shareholders 1985 he oracle from omaha takes the crown for best investor in the world he started managing 105 000 for family and friends in 1956 and has compounded it to half a trillion dollars today who is the second best anthony bolton is not widely known but in my view he is the sole occupier of second place in the pantheon of all time investment greats he was the superstar fund manager from the united kingdom with a track record rivaling buffett s bolton managed the fidelity special situations fund for twenty eight years from 1979 until 2007 and achieved an annualized return of 19 5 percent when the market yielded about 13 5 percent a sum of 1 000 would have compounded to 147 000 during his ten ure if there is a better dictionary definition of stellar i have yet to see it in 2010 he came back from retirement to launch a 460 million fund however the fund significantly underperformed the market and lost 14 percent over the next three years bolton had to leave the fund in 2014 how could a genius who had beaten the market over almost three decades suffer so dismally was it just bad luck or did he slip up if so where if this happened to bolton is anyone immune from such a fate the blessings and perils of signals if you are as ardent a fan of the national geographic channel as i am some of or all the following scenes should be familiar to you amale lion roaring to assert his dominance over a pride female baboons with their bright sexual swelling indicating their readi ness to mate bees performing their waggle dance to show the direction and distance of flowers a female elephant caressing her calf to soothe him a deep sea squid emitting light to attract prey and a meerkat squealing to warn her family of a predatory eagle all these are examples of signals and no textbook on evolutionary theory is complete without a lengthy discussion on them signals emitted by a sender have explicitly evolved to alter the behavior of the receiver and are used to communicate with and influence the behavior of prey predators mates competitors friends and family a signal can take myriad forms touch sound color motion light odor or some combination of these no organism could live without emitting and receiving signals but a misdirected or misread signal can also lead to death although evolution has honed the signal emitting and receiving skills and instincts of animals and plants over millions of years the race to deceive a predator or beat a competitor for food or a mate is never over this book is about an integral part of the financial services industry an industry that deserves its reputation for dishon esty and deceit few have described the sad state of our industry better than fred schwed in his hard hitting timeless classic where are the customers yachts those of you who suffered through the global financial crisis of 2008 have probably exhausted every cuss word for us finance folks if you aren t an evolutionary biologist you probably believe that deception is the sole preserve of our cunning species not so let s start with green frogs green frogs like most animals have a short window for mating during this crucial period males need to defend their territories aggressively to maximize their reproductive success larger males advertise their size and dominance by making calls croaks if you prefer at a lower frequency than smaller frogs thus a male green frog who is evolutionarily programmed to avoid larger and stronger green frogs will not enter a territory filled with low frequency croaks his brain equates low frequency croaks with unbeatable rivals what do you do if you are a small green frog live without a mate and die a virgin no sir some small green frogs have found a way to lower their signals pitch thereby communicating that they are larger than they actually are 2 this ability enables them to preserve their territories by fooling the larger males some small green frogs hijack a low frequency croak to send a dis honest signal thereby gaining evolutionary advantage this dishonest signal is easy to produce and imposes a very small cost on the signaler the small green frog if you think the green frogs are devious little dudes you should be suitably impressed with the shenanigans of the fantastic fiddler crabs fiddler crabs have gone one up on green frogs by dishonestly signaling their prowess to females and other males male fiddler crabs have a single large claw that serves the dual purpose of fighting other males and attracting females researchers have found that females differentially prefer males with larger claws and these well endowed males also successfully deter other male rivals when a male loses his large claw in a fight he usually grows a new claw that is lighter in weight slenderer and weaker however its size can still be impressive and it can look as potent as the previous heavier and deadlier claw these regenerated claws fool both sexes the females do not differentiate between these impostors and the males with the heavier real claws even the males with the real claws don t pick a fight with males with lighter and weaker but impressive looking regenerated claws researchers have found that up to 44 percent of males in a fiddler crab population can have regenerated claws and you thought it was only us finance folks whom you can t trust if you think dishonest signals are emitted solely by animals think again plants are masters of deception since they can t run or hide many of their survival strategies involve deceiving other plants or animals some of the best examples or worst if you happen to be a wasp are certain species of australian orchids australia has about 1 400 species of orchids and around 250 of these have adopted the same strategy of deceiving male wasps to enable pollination here is how it works when a female wasp who lives most of her life underground laying eggs is ready to mate she emerges from the ground and emits a distinctive pheromone that attracts the males many males typically descend on a female and start copulating in a frenzy nothing out of the ordinary here okay agreed a bit disconcerting but you know what i mean enter the orchid many orchid species have figured out a way to emit the same pheromone that a female wasp emits what is the result the male wasps end up copulating with orchid flowers thereby brushing against pollen which they carry to other flowers where the unfortunate wasps mate again and leave the pollen behind i don t want to give the impression that the living world is replete only with hustlers and cheats unlike green frogs fiddler crabs and australian orchids male guppies and coral snakes lead a more upright life guppies populate the mountain forest streams of venezuela trinidad and tobago whereas female guppies are plain and drab looking male guppies are quite colorful and no two males have the same color pattern i urge you to do a google image search of male guppies to see how dazzlingly beautiful they are scientists have experimentally demonstrated that females have a clear preference for brighter and more conspicuously red males with greater quantities of carotenoid pigments more on carotenoids shortly but conspicuous coloration comes at a huge cost to the males their life more colorful guppies are also subject to higher predation if the males have dull colors they won t get to mate but if they are brightly colored they are likely to be hunted down talk about being between a rock and a hard place thus brighter colors in a guppy are an honest signal of attractiveness to females as godin and mcdonough succinctly state the viability cost associated with bright conspicuous coloration in male guppies potentially reinforces for females the reliability of this sexually selected trait as an indicator trait of male quality s while a male guppy may attract predators by honestly communicating to females the deadly coral snake deters its potential predators with its bright coloration about ninety species of these fabulously colored and highly poisonous snakes are native to the tropics they have alternating patterns of three colors red black and yellow or white this kind of aposematic what a nice sounding word from the world of biology or conspicuous coloration is quite common among many poisonous plants and ani mals they are essentially broadcasting honestly to their potential predators don t you dare but what would evolution be if not bizarre and fascinating nonvenomous milk snakes kept as pets have almost the same coloration and banding pattern of coral snakes i bet that if you put the photographs of these two species side by side you would be unable to distinguish the poisonous one from the pet try it this kind of dishonest communication is called batesian mimicry and was first discovered in the 1860s by henry walter bates in butterflies of brazil 2 in batesian mimicry a harmless species mimics the coloration of a poisonous or unpalatable species to ward off predators milk snakes have successfully evolved through natural selection to mimic coral snakes thereby ensuring their survival i want to present a necessary qualifier here which i will assert a few more times to avoid anthropomorphic confusion the words honest and dishonest in the discussion so far do not communicate the intent of the signaler they point to the effect of the signal on the receiver when a signal fools the receiver it is dishonest when the receiver understands the signal for what it is it is honest neither the guppy nor the milk snake possesses the ability to dictate its body color the orchid is not deliberately releas ing pheromones nor is the fiddler crab consciously building a large fake claw these creatures are all products of natural selection honed over millions of years for example an ancestor of the harmless milk snake may have developed the coloration of the poisonous coral snake through a random mutation these mutants would have had a higher survival rate than their nonmutated peers thereby giving birth to more baby milk snakes with the same pattern these babies in turn would have been safer from predators and would have successfully produced more offspring with the same colorful pattern and so on over many generations all milk snakes would come to have the same coloration as coral snakes in doing so they have perfected the dishonest signal the handicap principle clarifies it all while i call myself an investor an evolutionary biologist would not be remiss in branding me a signal decoder the only things investors can rely on to assess a company are the signals emitted by it some direct and others indirect some comprehensible and others bizarre some ongoing and others delayed and some quantitative and others qualitative companies relay signals in the form of press releases media interviews analyst meetings earnings calls annual reports dividends buybacks acquisitions sec filings newspaper boasts and so much more most investors receive the same signals from companies since the capital market regulators have ensured the standardization and transparency of communication so how is it that the long term performance of different investors who are all within a small band of seemingly prodigious intellectual capacity varies significantly among the many reasons for this variance one that stands out for me is an investor s ability to decode honest signals from dishonest ones figure 7 1 acting on a dishonest signal and ignoring an honest one can lead to hunger or death in the natural world a fate not too dissimilar to a fund s performance 7 1 the strutting male whose signal is more honest a the businessperson s or b the deer s source licensed from shutterstock but how is an investor supposed to distinguish between an honest signal and a dishonest one let s turn to the israeli evolutionary biologist amotz zahavi for an exquisitely elegant answer but first a brief background on signals in the early and middle parts of the twentieth century ethologists ethology is the study of animal behavior believed that signals were essentially honest indicators of senders underlying motives however in the 1970s two british scientists richard dawkins and john krebs took an almost diametrically opposite view claiming that signals were best seen as a deceitful manipulation by a sender to alter the behavior of the receiver for the sender s benefit 1 on the other hand the receiver was trying to fathom the true motive of the sender and plotting its own moves according to dawkins and krebs this leads to an arms race in which the sender and receiver are constantly trying to outdo each other however amotz zahavi rejected this pessimistic view of signals in 1975 he proposed his famous handicap principle which explains how and why honest signals can evolve in the natural world where animals are presumably trying to deceive one another zahavi s profound observation was that when signals for a particular trait are costly to produce he rightly termed such signals handicaps and cannot be matched by another with a lower quality of that trait they can be deemed honest that may sound logical but science unlike the investment profession needs empirical evidence to support its tall claims the scientific com munity did not fully accept the handicap principle until fifteen years after the publication of the article in which zahavi presented it 42 in 1990 two articles by the scottish biologist alan grafen finally turned the tide in its favor the best route to understanding the handicap principle is through carotenoids carotenoids are a class of pigments ranging from yellow to orange to red they also provide health benefits by acting as antioxidants and strengthening the immune system animals can t synthesize carotenoids within their bodies and must procure them by eating plants bacteria or fungi carotenoids play a strong signaling role and scientists have studied their effect extensively in three species the house finch a bird the three spined stickleback a fish and the guppy if the handicap principle is accurate we should be able to confirm the following three hypotheses 1 females are differentially attracted to males with redder or brighter hues 2 males with a redder coloration are fitter than paler males and 3 it is costly for healthy males to produce a deep red pigment in the species studied researchers have shown conclusively that females react more favorably to males that display a deeper carotenoid pigmentation male house finches for example have three patches of carotenoid pigmentation on their body on the crown throat and rump each patch varies in coloration from pale yellow to bright red experiments clearly show that female house finches prefer to consort with redder males whether this redness results from natural diet or artificial dyes this finding supports the first hypothesis receiver response to provide support for the second hypothesis signal honesty scientists demonstrated that well fed house finches devel oped a deeper red coloration compared to those fed less nutritious food when researchers exposed three spined sticklebacks to parasites the ones with a higher load of infectious ciliate had a significant decrease in red coloration other experiments like the one by godin and mcdonough described earlier have found evidence for the same phenomenon in guppies thus deeper carotenoid pigmentation does seem to indicate better overall health let s now deal with the last and most crucial hypothesis whether honest signals impose a cost on the signaler over the years biologists have unearthed four possible costs of deeper carotenoid pigmentation first carotenoid levels in fish scales or bird plumage are directly correlated with the amount of carotenoid in the animal s gut thus the more time an animal spends eating nutritious food the redder the pigment but also the greater the cost incurred second since carotenoids have health benefits and are needed to ward off disease and parasites redirecting them from the gut to dead tissues like scales or feathers for display pur poses is a costly maneuver for the animal third displaying carotenoid pigmentation involves the cost of processing carotenoids in the gut and then transporting them to the feathers or scales hence only those animals that have eaten enough nutritious food are up to the task the fourth obvious cost is the risk of death a deep red coloration charms females and foes alike in laboratory experiments trout have been shown to be more likely to attack redder sticklebacks and blue acara cichlids are more likely to kill guppies with greater carotenoid pigmentation thus according to the handicap principle redder male house finches attract more mates presumably because their message to females is look how healthy and virile i am 1 am so darned red it would be very costly and potentially even suicidal for a weak or diseased house finch to produce more carotenoid pigmentation given the diversion of resources required obviously male house finches do not consciously decide to produce redder colors the healthier ones simply have enough nutritional resources to produce the pigmentation and the weaker ones don t ditto for the brightly colored male guppy in the example mentioned earlier or the dude with the shiny red ferrari all of them show off ornaments that are very expensive to pro duce or procure and hence accurately communicate the signaler s well being and herein lies zahavi s lesson for us investors lend credence only to those signals from companies that are costly to produce that however is easier said than done what does costly to produce mean in the context of a corporate environment what is the equivalent of a peacock s resplendent tail a shiny new corporate headquarters an industry award a growing market value a ceo s forbes profile or something else i am a practicing investor not a finance academic i cannot offer a regression model proven to be statistically relevant but i can offer the practical ways in which my team and i distinguish between honest and dis honest signals dishonest signals galore let s start with real life examples of dishonest signals that is those that do not reliably communicate the trait they are supposed to a dishonest signal does not imply that the sender is dishonest although they might be it simply means that the signal may not communicate what it is supposed to just as in the natural world an honest person in a business setting can send a dishonest signal without necessarily having a bad intention when we evaluate a business to make an investment or divestment we ignore the following types of signals or assign them a very low weight in our overall evaluation press releases on july 29 2014 apple s press release claimed that the company had updated the macbook pro with retina display note the capi tal r and d 13 should investors have cared about this news maybe you would have been impressed if you were a discerning consumer but how would this announcement have helped an investor decide if apple was a good company to buy you could argue that the press release indicated apple s prowess in keeping up with the latest technology trends and so it was in fact quite informative but how many investors or nontechies in general even know or understand what retina display means i don t even if retina display whatever it is were to turn out to be a cool new technology how was anyone to conclude from this in formation that the macbook pro would become a success and to belabor the point even if an investor did understand what retina display meant and even if they concluded from various sources that it was likely to be a great success how would this knowledge help them decide whether to buy apple shares unless they could accurately forecast the profits and cash flows to be made from the increased sales of the macbook pro as a result of this technology apress release is probably the most used or should i say abused signal given out by companies the reason it does not cost anything for the company to be in the press regularly apart from the retainer for the pr agency which is usually an annual fixed expense many companies resort to regular press releases and interviews to share news of product launches management changes strategy shifts and organization changes first lam deeply suspicious of companies regularly in the press don t they have anything better to do but even those that are not professionals at managing the press through their public relations consultants rarely have anything helpful to say for a long term investor second press releases can be and frequently are more insidious than the harmless macbook pro announcement many press releases appear to reveal significant information that a long term investor must absorb but turn out to be empty boasts at best and deliberate obfuscation at worst take the example of a unilever press release from january 20 2015 14 the headline states confidently profitable growth in tougher markets a detailed look at the press release left me scratching my confused head i assume you agree that developed markets like the united states and western europe should be classified as tough because they are mature have high competitive intensity and have growth challenges but if you read the press release carefully you will notice that sales in 2014 declined by 0 8 percent in developed markets sales did grow 5 7 percent in emerging markets though even this growth was lower than in 2013 but i would not call emerging markets tough interestingly the press release fails to mention which markets according to unilever are tough and which are easy maybe you disagree with me and prefer to call emerging markets tough alright let s go ahead with that definition but then how does one explain a sales decline of 20 percent in the fourth quarter in china a slowdown of this magnitude especially in a market as large as china may be relevant information for investors but as we saw it is nowhere in the headlines unilever s overall sales in 2014 by the way declined by 2 7 percent was this the cause for celebration that the press release seemed to imply the bottom line is that making investment or divestment decisions based on a press release can be harmful to a fund s bot tom line we treat press releases as what they are a cheap signal given by companies to make competitors envious and to attract investors employees and customers we don t give them any importance management interviews in the media it was june 13 2019 the fifty one year old visionary ceo was giving an interview to bloomberg s matt miller on the sidelines of europe s most prestigious digital and tech conference in berlin his company was a giant in payment processing and from being a scrappy start up in the early 2000s its soaring market value had enabled it to win an entry into the coveted dax index in 2018 its stock price had tripled over the past three years valuing it at about 18 billion twenty three of twenty nine research analysts cov ering the company had a buy rating on it over the years the financial times business newspaper and some short sellers had raised issues about its accounting prac tices but the company had brushed aside all the allegations in this context matt miller was conducting an impressive interview rather than fawning over the celebrity ceo miller posed some tough questions on the sources of the company s growth its ques tionable corporate governance practices and the reasons for the persistent rumors about the company s lax compliance processes the relaxed and confident ceo looked miller directly in the eyes and answered every question with remarkable clarity and precision he assured miller that asia was the primary growth engine its new sales were up 160 percent and contrary to the pop ular view it was also witnessing growth in europe the ceo came down heavily on his detractors reminding miller that his share price had delivered a 36 percent annualized return over the past fourteen years he was confident that his compliance staff of two hundred were world class and explained that the company was investing heavily in technology to enable digital monitoring of transactions almost exactly a year after this interview on june 23 2020 the ceo was arrested on charges of criminal fraud the com pany filed for insolvency on june 25 2020 the ceo s name markus braun the company wirecard braun and wirecard had been lying for years but braun s hero worship was so deep and widespread in germany that the national regulator bafin filed a criminal complaint against financial times reporters in 2019 accusing them of market manipula tion braun was a national champion so how could he be wrong you can watch the bloomberg interview on bloomberg tv 12 braun comes across as a well meaning smart and thoughtful leader clearly well ahead of the competition on digital payments yes i know i am cherry picking one management interview to show how useless they are as a species but i hope you will not dispute that braun showed remarkable skills as an interviewee he reduced the complex global operations of wirecard to sound bites like scalable digital payments risk management and innovation i am almost certain he resonated with view ers many of whom were surely also investors in the company while i have taken an extreme example it highlights two common features of almost all management interviews first they are an exercise in making the management look good and many of them are good but as you must know from your own experience looking good is not the same as being good second these kinds of interviews can provide us a lot of information about the interviewee dog s name and favorite dish included and the company but not a lot that is relevant to an investor for example braun s statements in many areas we are pioneers and we are concentrating on technology innovations may be of literary academic sociological or cultural interest but what do they tell me an investor nothing i should be impressed by these quotes as a viewer but not as someone who wishes to invest in wirecard have you ever read management interviews that claim they aren t innovative don t have the best business leaders aren t leveraging technology aren t customer focused don t treat their employees well don t listen to shareholders make bad capital allocations and ignore the value of making sustainable investments i haven t but the fact remains that most of the businesses ihave encountered in my life as a consultant and as an investor have been deeply flawed in more ways than one they either don t know it or won t admit to it excellence is rare in this world including the business world you just won t know it if you are relying on management interviews iam not saying i don t read or listen to or watch interviews of business leaders i do but i read them for the same reason i read articles on brexit running films and the latest trump tantrum to gossip with friends to pass the time on a sunday after noon and for general interest in our fascinating world not for investing investor conferences and road shows assume for a moment that you have had no exposure to the equity markets the industry is facing a major problem and you are asked to solve it the company management teams seem to be spending too much time entertaining questions from myriad in vestors and serious investors complain that their calls to companies remain unanswered because the management teams are sick and tired of answering the same questions the investors as well as company management waste a lot of time and air miles meet ing each other across various cities what would be the best way to ensure that company information is shared efficiently across all interested investors if you are a smart person which you are after all you are reading this book right you will most probably come up with the following answer invite many companies and investors to a single location preferably a city with good flight connections and let them interact formally through presentations and informally at lunches and dinners well congratulations you have the right solution this is exactly what the industry does by running conferences ranging in length from one to five days tens sometimes even hundreds of companies converge to make a series of presentations to visiting investors road shows are a scaled down version of these conferences during which the company management typically visits in vestors at their offices since most investors have offices in large cities like new york san francisco london and tokyo acompany can usually meet six to eight investors in a single day what do you think most company managers want when they meet investors they want the investors to buy their stock so that the share price moves up are they likely to present a balanced view of their business it would be easier to believe in santa claus my experience tells me that most of these conferences and road shows are an excuse for the company to show off ina thirty minute presentation the company management will sing paeans of their strategy for 29 9 minutes they will spend the remain ing 0 1 minute drinking water or if they are feeling generous mentioning a couple of risks in such hushed tones that you will miss them if you sneeze i know am exaggerating but not by much i can assure you and i don t blame them if i were them i would behave the same way a conference or a road show is a dishonest signal because it does not cost the management team anything to present an overly optimistic view of their company and so that is what they do it is a chest thumping marketing jamboree not a forum to evaluate investment opportunities dispassionately do we at nalanda attend conferences and meet management teams during road shows we absolutely do but we employ a stratospheric level of discounting to company presentations and treat these conferences and road shows as a starting point for evaluating interesting businesses not as a shortcut to building robust investment theses one of the ways we use conferences is to meet our portfolio companies competitors are they launching new products are they entering new segments what is their approach to acquisitions how are they planning to allocate capital are they becom ing better than the company we own but we never exit a management meeting in this kind of dog and pony show claiming that we have found a winner or loser and that we should place an order to buy or sell investor conferences and road shows are dishonest signals not because management are dishonest most of them are upright folks doing their job but because it does not cost anything to spin the best story possible in a forty five minute presenta tion to an audience that is partly brain dead from rushing from one meeting to another earnings guidance many publicly listed companies project their profits after tax also called earnings over the next fiscal year for example in janu ary 2019 during their earnings call they will project their earnings for the full year of 2019 in subsequent calls usually held after every quarter they update this guidance depending on their recent performance and outlook analysts and investors follow earn ings guidance quite seriously and stock prices react promptly to the under or overachievement of this guidance investors and analysts love earnings guidance from companies in fact according to an article from pr newswire 77 percent of the 180 analysts surveyed wanted companies to provide guidance 1é analysts are smart folks so you must be thinking that they can learn a lot from the future pronouncements of companies sadly they don t what do you think a management team s projections for the next year are based on in fact on what basis does anyone make forecasts about the near to medium term the recent past a hope for a better future spreadsheet manipulation all of the above take your pick earnings guidance is a dishonest signal even though the management may fervently believe in it it is cheap easy to produce and needs little effort to deliver in my career spanning more than three decades i have sat on the boards of more than two dozen companies ranging from a market value of 5 million to about 50 billion at the beginning of every fiscal year all these company management teams usually present their budgets for the year and i don t remember a single occasion when a management team hit its target let me repeat that not a single occasion i am not kidding the businesses either exceeded their budgets or underperformed and they had no way of knowing which would happen there is a simple reason why earnings are so hard to predict multiplicative probability earnings or profit after tax is the last line item on a company profit and loss statement we can calculate profit after tax after deducting from revenues the cash expenses noncash expenses like depreciation and amortization financial charges and taxes thus the management needs to hit its target on all these line items to hope for an accurate earnings guidance many of these are not even under the management s control for example interest rates may change thereby affecting the interest income or expense a global company selling in international markets can significantly undershoot or overshoot its bud get owing to currency movements but even the line items that you think are in management s control aren t usually so take revenues let s say the manage ment has confidently projected a certain level of sales for next year but what if the economy grows faster than predicted or slower what if the competitor launches a price war what if one of the factories shuts down because of a fire what if the com pany s best sales manager accounting for 7 percent of sales falls ill suddenly none of these what ifs is theoretical they have all happened in businesses for which i have been a board member or investor one may now assert that the costs incurred by a business should surely be under management s control after all costs are all internal aren t they nope take raw materials a manufacturing company using a wide variety of plastics and metals is subject to commodity price fluctuations a logistics provider is held hostage to petroleum prices and a services company needs to bend to the vagaries of labor market prices especially if it is using part time staff sales and advertising expenses seem more controllable a marketing manager can decide to spend 10 million on advertising next year and that s that right not so fast if anew venture backed competitor emerges that offers a similar product at a 25 percent discount the marketing manager may have to react by in creasing the marketing budget significantly recall your basic probability class you will remember that when many events are supposed to occur simultaneously x and y and z the cumulative probability is arrived at by multiplying all the individual probabilities let s assume that the management you are evaluating is truly unique in its ability to forecast and their predictive accuracy is 80 percent thus the probability of hitting the right earnings number if it is to be broken into just five component parts revenues discounts employee expenses manufacturing expenses and sales expenses would be less than 33 percent 0 8 in reality the number of line items before we arrive at the earnings number is much more than five so how would it be possible even for a world class management team to keep hitting its earnings guidance numbers every quarter or every year it is almost a mathematical impossibility so what is the point of the financial community s laser focus on this number ido not blame company management or analysts for this disease yes i call it a disease because it infects almost everyone in the asset management industry and prevents investors from performing to their full potential the blame for this malady should fall squarely on us the investment community which exerts enormous pressure on businesses and sell side firms to come up with a single earnings number a mckinsey analysis of earnings guidance reaches the following unflattering conclusion our analysis of the perceived ben efits of issuing frequent earnings guidance found no evidence that it affects valuation multiples improves shareholder returns or reduces share price volatility 2 the beneficiaries of earnings guidance appear to be neither the investors nor the management only the brokers the reports concludes the only significant effect we observed is an increase in trading volumes when compa nies start issuing guidance and that s not all the sad irony of earnings guidance is this a company consistently meeting its earnings guidance should be seen with an even greater degree of skepticism why general electric ge in the latter half of the twentieth century ge was one of the most revered companies on the planet and under jack welch the ceo of ge from 1981 to 2001 it scaled heights never seen by any company on the planet 2 under his leadership the company increased its market value more than forty times over two decades in august 2000 ge s market value was 601 billion making it the most valuable company on earth by the end of 2021 it was a shadow of its former self having lost about 85 percent of its value many things went wrong at ge and this is not the place to list them but one of the most striking things about ge during the jack welch era was its ability to hit its earnings target quarter after quarter year after year analysts and investors loved ge when ge declared it would meet its earnings the next year it always did as welch said in an interview with carol loomis of fortune what investor would want to buy a conglomerate like ge unless its earnings were predictable the company had become so blasé and arrogant about managing its numbers that the cfo dennis dammerman was bold enough to admit to fortune ok we re going to take these large gains and offset them with discretionary decisions with restructurings he was smoothening his profits in plain sight the managers were under enormous pressure to hit their earnings targets when jeff immelt the ceo after jack welch took over the plastics division at ge and found that the previous management had been fudging the profits he chose to keep quiet he was a rising star within ge and knew that not meeting his budget was not an option ge hada special purpose vehicle called edison conduit that was supposed to be independent of the company but wasn t ge capital guaranteed edison s liabilities effectively making it a ge company why did it exist its stated purpose was to issue commercial paper but its main objective was to create profits out of thin air it periodically bought assets from ge capital at higher prices than the book value thereby showing profits but how can a company buy its own assets to show profits you ask good question today it can t it would be considered fraud but the company was exploiting an accounting loophole of the pre enron era in 2002 the sarbanes oxley act passed and many accounting tricks being used by ge became illegal jack welch had timed his retirement almost perfectly in 2001 jeff immelt the new ceo never got the leeway from the accountants that his boss had and kept missing investor expectations ge s stock price went into a decline that hasn t been arrested more than two decades after welch s retirement iam not suggesting that all of ge s problems resulted from its guidance culture but i think it played a significant role when business managers are hyper focused on meeting quarterly numbers their long term orientation takes a back seat when a com pany is desperate to make an acquisition just to meet its earnings it can overpay for a bad asset when a manager is unable to speak the truth about accounting obfuscations they pile up over time last let s assume for a moment that a company can accurately predict its earnings without any accounting shenanigans of the kind employed by ge so what should it matter to a long term investor that the next year s earnings will grow at 5 percent or decline by 10 percent we base our assessment of a company on its riskiness competitive moat quality of financials and management integrity not onits ability to forecast earnings accurately we know it is very hard to predict earnings consistently so why measure anyone on it we have never bothered to assess earnings guidance from companies and have tried to persuade many of our portfolio com panies to cease providing guidance the results i will admit have been mixed old habits die hard face to face meetings with management in mid 2015 valeant a pharmaceutical company run by a mckinsey alum called mike pearson was the darling of the stock market and had a market value of about 90 billion just five years before in 2010 its market value was only about 5 billion there was no business magazine that had not covered the stupendous success of valeant nothing could stop this jugger naut acquiring pharma companies and cutting costs to the bone to enhance profits investors loved mike and his seemingly un beatable strategy and marquee investors like pershing square sequoia and valueact were big fans charlie munger however was having none of it he rightly spotted that valeant s debt fueled acquisition spree was a recipe for disaster combined with valeant s numerous unethical business practices e g raising the prices of life saving drugs many times after acquiring them he opined that valeant would fail spectacularly sooner or later in a may 2016 interview with fox business munger called the company worse than a sewer 2 munger s views irritated some of valeant s largest shareholders including bill ackman the cio of pershing square he wrote a lengthy letter to munger in april 2015 requesting him to meet with mike pearson but munger refused munger did not needa meeting to detect the honest signals of valeant s corruption and incompetence valeant had its comeuppance soon after and by mid 2016 had lost 90 percent of its value bill ackman s pershing square took a loss of 3 billion on valeant why were so many experienced investors blind to the problems that munger had highlighted publicly why could munger correctly predict valeant s demise without meeting mike pearson when many of valeant s board members and investors continued to be passionate supporters my hypothesis is this mike pearson was a fantastic salesperson correction he was probably one of the best salespeople to have enamored wall street the smartest people lost their sense of judgment when faced with mike pearson s persuasive skills valeant s honest signals of its myriad problems remained undetected or ignored in the light of the dishonest signals emitted by mike pearson in face to face meetings which by definition were cheap to produce again iam not asserting that mike pearson was dishonest maybe he genuinely believed what he said it doesn t really mat ter the reason munger was right was that he knew that any face to face meeting is a dishonest signal this claim that face to face meetings aren t a reliable signal may seem strange at first glance given the importance of man agement teams for most investors whether they are venture capitalists private equity funds or mutual funds many investors take pride in judging management teams based on a single meeting and if you are one such investor good for you iam not the odds are that many investors think they are good at judging people but they generally aren t let s assume we encounter a genius who is genuinely able to judge a person s character based on a face to face meeting my assertion here is even if they pos sess this rare skill it will be useless in a management meeting and will not enable them to become a better investor the reason is simple any signal that management gives during a meeting is a cheap signal requiring minimal effort and since it is cheap the signal may be dishonest even if the management is not for example management may believe that their product is high quality and they will say so in a meeting would you believe their assertion or would you do independent checks to assess the product s quality management may genuinely believe that their recent underperformance relative to domestic competition is a result of their focus on overseas markets if you are a good judge of people and conclude that management is telling the truth would you take their stated belief to be true management knows what you want to hear and quite often that is what you will hear we do meet management teams we use these meetings to build relationships and to understand their corporate history and some of their past decisions we never use management meetings to build an investment case or test key hypotheses because we know we will hear what they want us to hear not what we want to know invoking zahavi to interpret signals that matter it looks like we are in a bit of soup here if we can t rely on press releases investor conferences earnings guidance or management meetings what kinds of signals can we as investors trust let s go back to amotz zahavi whose assertion about the natural world is highly relevant to the investing world we should trust only costly signals emitted by companies because they are the only ones we can rely on but what signals are costly to produce and hence reliable broadly there are two we know the first one from chapter 5 past operating and financial performance i will not rehash the logic i outlined in chapter 5 for visiting the past to assess a business and industry suffice it to say that we at nalanda treat the past as one of two critical and reliable signals for our investment and divestment decisions the past has hap pened it is there for us to see it is an undeniable signal of the company s actions and outcomes the problem of course is that in vestors seem intently focused on receiving signals about the future let s take the example of a ubiquitous phenomenon in the world of investing conference calls i know discussed conference calls in chapter 5 but it s important to revisit the phenomenon in the light of honest and dishonest signals a quarterly call is a strong signal sent by the management to the broader analyst and investor community the ceo cfo and some other key business leaders typically attend the calls if there is one place where you can get all your answers this is it jamie dimon of jpmorgan mark zuckerberg of facebook jack dorsey formerly of twitter tim cook of apple elon musk of tesla all these business leaders regularly attend their companies quarterly calls let s take a concrete example chevron one of the world s largest oil companies had revenues of about 140 billion and a market value of about 190 billion in 2019 the management held a conference call for investors and analysts on january 31 2020 to highlight its performance the analysts and investors asked twenty nine questions what percentage of these do you think were about the future more than 70 percent here is a small sample of these future directed questions can you talk a little bit more about how you think about volumes in 2020 remember that this call is from the start of 2020 i was curious where else we could see some upside in the portfolio in 2020 as you continue to shed assets and capital intensity is lowered just wondering how repeatable outsized dividend growth could be over the long term in and of themselves the questions on volumes potential upside and potential dividend growth are important but just because a question is important does not mean it has a good or reliable answer i want to know my fund returns next year but i would be foolish to pick a number let s take the questions on volumes and potential upside chevron management gave a lengthy answer to these queries but essentially said that volume growth would be in the same ballpark as in previous years little did they or anyone else for that matter know that the covid 19 pandemic would strike or that the price of and demand for oil would drop precipitously chevron would end 2020 with a net loss of 5 5 billion compared to a net profit of 2 9 billion in 2019 in the fourth quarter of 2020 revenue had dropped to 25 billion from 35 billion a year earlier a reduction of almost 30 percent during the conference call management predicted capital spending of 21 billion in 2020 the actual number 13 billion all the questions related to chevron s performance in 2020 and beyond essentially turned out to be useless i know lam being unfair because i have chosen the year of the pandemic to talk about the difficulty of making predictions but by doing so i want to highlight the absurdity of the financial sector s focus on a company s future no business could have predicted the calami ties of 2020 and chevron was no exception we can assume that chevron management are honest and willing to answer questions to the best of their abilities but how can any signal they give about the future be anything but cheap and hence dishonest given that pontification of future events does not demand much effort any talk of the future is unreliable and just speculation if i were in a senior management position at chevron and asked these questions my replies would have been no different the problem is not with chevron it is with us the financial industry folks who want to coerce the management of companies to do the undoable and then blame them when they don t meet our impossible standards an honest signal is not our margin will be 15 percent next year but our average margin was 12 percent over the last ten years an honest signal is not we will have robust free cash flows starting two years from now but we generated free cash flow only one year in the last decade an honest signal is not we will launch six new products next year but in our recent history we have launched an average of one product every two years no stories no projections just facts about the past because she said so while most people show positive bias in evaluating themselves and their kids they can be remarkably candid and accurate when it comes to analyzing other people and their spouses as an investor we have used this well proven human quality to solicit positive and negative signals on companies a good reputation is a very costly signal and hence an honest one because building a name for oneself in any industry consumes enormous management time and effort over many years if not decades therefore before we make an investment we spend many months speaking to dealers competitors ex employees suppli ers and industry experts to get a holistic understanding of a company and its industry we consider these scuttlebutt signals to be sincere for two reasons first in general i have found that few people have an incentive to lie unless they bear a serious grudge against a company if a competitor is impressed with the company you are evaluating it will say so and give you many reasons for saying so second once we have performed enough interviews with people connected to the company but not necessarily from the company we start to get a good sense of the management s reputation and quality i learned a valuable scuttlebutt lesson in 2008 less than a year after starting nalanda we had become deeply interested in a manufacturing company in india with a market value of almost 2 billion the company had a very high return on capital over its long history claimed to design and manufacture products that others couldn t and had a roster of marquee clients the financial community was all praises for the businesses we met the management and came away suitably impressed with the articulation of its strategy and philosophy our analysis of past results and performance yielded only positive news we started talking to the company s customers who were largely in the health care sector we were surprised when all the customers we spoke to categorized it as a commodity supplier not a specialist manufacturer they told us that they were buying from this company only because it offered the lowest prices not because it sold the latest high tech products it was clear to us after a few customer calls that the company had been resorting to hyperbole when it touted the quality of its products and depth of customer relationships we also spotted a strange anomaly in its balance sheet a number of receivable days of 270 seemed too high for a company that claimed to have a strong relationship with its customers why would customers take nine months to pay when we asked the company their glib response was that this was customary in the health care industry during our scuttlebutt calls we checked with the customers and all of them told us that they were paying the company within 90 days as per their agreement where was the cash hiding for the remaining 180 days our third scuttlebutt signal turned out to be the most damaging we were able to interview the company s previous head of sales who had resigned a few months earlier when we asked him about company performance he quipped you are financial sector folks so maybe you can explain this anomaly to me i was the global sales head and was responsible for 100 percent of com pany revenues but my actual delivered sales numbers for the quarter were always much lower than what the company stated in its quarterly financial results how could it be so we didn t need to hear any more the market value of this business is down 98 percent from its peak in early 2008 if we had relied only on the company s stated past financial and operating performance and had not performed our exten sive scuttlebutt research maybe nalanda would not exist today it may not have been possible to recover from making a dud in vestment of 150 to 200 million as an aside the great investor philip a fisher first popularized the scuttlebutt approach in his 1958 classic common stocks and uncommon profits in chapter 2 what scuttlebutt can do he asserts the business grapevine is a remarkable thing it is amazing what an accurate picture of the relative points of strength and weakness of each company in an industry can be ob tained from a representative cross section of the opinions of those who in one way or another are concerned with any particular company truer words have rarely been uttered back to bolton let s get back to the mystery of the underperformance of the 460 million fund launched by anthony bolton in 2010 i deliber ately withheld a key piece of information from you earlier bolton launched his fund in china not the united kingdom i don t know what he was thinking but having shown his mettle in the united kingdom i am assuming bolton wanted a new challenge but china is not the united kingdom especially when it comes to the behavior and track record of listed companies as an aside india is not that different from china in this regard you may have heard of luckin coffee which was supposed to be the starbucks of china it claimed to have a more scalable model than starbucks because it sold cheap coffee primarily for takeout and delivery it had positioned itself as a tech company because customers could order through its app many marquee investors in cluding one of china s largest venture capital firms joy capital and singapore s sovereign wealth fund gic had invested in luckin at a valuation of 1 billion the company went public in the united states in may 2019 and by january 2020 its stock price had reached 50 valuing the company at more than 12 billion in late january the famous short seller muddy waters released a scathing report on luckin alleging that its sales numbers were falsely elevated 2 to make matters worse luckin s auditor ernst young unearthed fraudu lent behavior by luckin s senior employees by may 2020 the stock had crashed more than 95 percent luckin unfortunately is not an exception chinese companies like china agritech china green agriculture china inte grated energy gsx techedu iqiyi longwei petroleum orient paper puda coal and sino clean energy have all been accused of accounting irregularities or outright fraud 22 there are probably as many explanations as there are experts to account for anthony bolton s failure in china mine is this bolton confused the chinese signals for british ones he did not realize that the signals from many chinese companies were funda mentally dishonest and that he should have been much more skeptical of their veracity 22 in an interview with south china morning post the morningstar analyst zhao hu pointed out that not one or two but three investee companies of bolton s china fund had reeled under accounting and product recall scandals bolton was accustomed to honest signals from british companies but in zhao hu s words obviously he had not discounted enough risk into his invest ments in those small unproven chinese firms wasp and orchid redux 2k there is almost never a clear winner in the arms race between the senders and receivers of signals in the natural world you may have heard of cuckoos leaving their eggs in the nests of other bird species so that someone else can rear their chicks the signals here are the size shape and color of the cuckoo egg which match those of the eggs of some other bird species however scientists have found that some of the parasitized bird species have not allowed themselves to be exploited they have evolved to produce eggs that are distinctly different even compared to eggs of their own species 2 as a result they recognize cuckoo eggs as interlop ers they have evolved a way to detect the dishonest signal from cuckoos this race has no winner and there will probably never be one in sharp contrast in the business world the senders of signals the companies are clearly winning over the receivers us the gullible investors no wonder our community performs poorly compared to the broader market what should we long term in vestors do ignore the green frog and heed the guppy chapter summary evolutionary theory has taught me that reimagining investing requires us to differentiate between the honest and dishonest signals of businesses 1 in nature the sender of a signal attempts to influence the behavior of the receiver for the receiver differentiating be tween an honest and a dishonest signal can be the difference between life and death 2 a green frog mimicking the low pitched croak of its larger rival is a dishonest signal whereas the conspicuous coloration of amale guppy is an honest indicator of its health and virility 3 zahavi s handicap principle contends that a signal that is costly to produce is honest and can thus be relied upon by the receiver the cost may be in the form of additional resources required to produce the signal or an increased risk of mortality 4 as investors we too are bombarded with signals many of which are dishonest examples include press releases manage ment meetings and interviews investor conferences and earnings guidance all these signals attempt to favorably im press investors and are generally quite easy to produce we ignore all of them 5 we rely exclusively on honest signals from businesses that as in the natural world are costly to produce these include past operating and financial performance and scuttlebutt signals from suppliers customers competitors ex employees and industry experts section iii don t be lazy be very lazy fyou have come this far i hope you have been nodding your head in agreement more often than cursing the reviewers who persuaded you to buy or borrow this book what s not to like about avoiding significant risks and buying high quality busi nesses of course you and i can quibble about how much weight to give management meetings whether 20 percent roce is acceptable or at which stage of a turnaround one should invest however suppose you are a long term investor or desire to be one in that case iam assuming we agree directionally taking on avoidable risks is bad and investing in great businesses is good alas our bonhomie may not last beyond this page when it comes to buying and selling businesses we are not just lazy we are very lazy we rarely buy and seldom sell many probably most longterm investors ultimately sell their investments especially when the price is egregious we don t we are permanent owners we will not sell a single share in a business we love there are some minor caveats to this which i will get to but while some of you may accept the notion of buying rarely the thought of never selling may seem wrong even foolish to you that s all right my task in this book is not to tell you what you should do but to share what we do chapters 8 and 9 invoke two relatively unknown tenets of evolutionary theory to bolster the case for buying rarely and selling even more rarely chapter 10 focuses on selling or rather not selling by elaborating on a well known but underappreciated concept that unites evolution and long term investing finally i conclude the book by highlighting a key lesson for investors from evolutionary theory a simple process can lead to a stellar outcome tend with rabbits and honeybees but we must begin with birds and bears chapter 8 birds and bears bare an aberration it may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising throughout the world every variation even the slightest rejecting that which is bad preserving and adding up all that is good silently and insensibly working whenever and wherever opportunity offers at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life charles darwin on the origin of species

in 1976 had perished peter and laurene took careful measurements of the dead and the living birds and went to princeton to tabulate their findings with a heavy heart the results were astounding had they proven darwin wrong what unites fed rates chinese ports and german regulators one of the biggest bollywood blockbusters of the 1970s was roti kapda aur makaan bread clothes and shelter over more than two and a half hours yes bollywood movies can be lengthy of nonstop melodrama the film dwells on the importance of the low est rung of maslow s hierarchy of needs if it were to be made today it would be named wi fi roti kapda aur makaan to me the pre internet era seems unimaginably dull but then there was always a lot happening in the world the difference now is that iam made aware of it with barely a second s delay for a hospital nurse a chocolate salesperson or an automotive engineer the flood of nonstop news can be like background noise they have the option of tuning in or out of it depending on their mood and the amount of free time they have some may choose to obsess over specific topics on social media but their jobs and the general news flow are denizens of nonoverlapping worlds for most of them not so for investors most will tell you that the flow of news especially business news is a critical input for their decision making so it would be highly unusual not to find cnbc playing on mute in their offices or a shiny bloomberg terminal with scrolling news stories on their desks why let me explain by sampling some headlines from the june 22 2021 online edition of the financial times wall street rebounds as markets adjust to fed rate rise outlook covid outbreak at chinese port exacerbates global supply chain delays german regulator launches antitrust probe into apple emerging markets are right to worry about capital flows solar power investors burnt by the rise in raw material costs did your heart start to beat faster by the time you reached the headline on solar power knowing my industry i am sure that many investors reacted to one or more of these news items by making small but significant changes to their portfolios start with the first news item on the fed rate rise outlook remember the discounted cash flow dcf models we encoun tered in chapter 5 i bet that most investors worldwide not just in the united states would have adjusted their dcf models to reflect the potential change in rates the u s dollar is the world s currency and any interest rate movement in the united states is vital to any country s interest rate i don t know if this is actually so the issue is too esoteric for me but i do know that it is seen to be so my inbox receives detailed commentary from indian analysts whenever the u s fed tinkers or threatens to tinker with the interest rate and what happens when someone changes the discount rate of their model the stocks appear cheap or expensive which is a trigger for buying or selling anewspaper headline about the u s interest rate triggered stock market activity across the world let s take the second headline about the covid 19 outbreak at a chinese port the article discusses the closure of shenzhen port in china one of the world s largest container terminals for a week after some workers tested positive for covid we learn that the container freight rate has quintupled since the previous october a clothing factory owner in guangzhou laments that the sit uation is like a nightmare for her it certainly is but should it be for investors it almost certainly was i would not be surprised if the shares of companies in the following industries witnessed frenetic activity after this news container shipping companies shopping manufacturers ports clothing manufacturers logistics companies companies anywhere in the world that import a lot of products from china and companies anywhere in the world that don t import a lot of products from china after all wouldn t they be saving money compared to those who do import from china a headline about a chinese port triggered stock market activity across the world last one why should a german regulator launching an antitrust probe into apple affect the stock prices of companies other than apple you ask it is not inconceivable that the stock price of quasi monopolies like amazon facebook google and twitter would have reacted to this news because fund managers in the united states and elsewhere decided that a rubicon had been crossed owing to the action of the german regulator and this would have led to a zillion buy or sell orders depending on whether fund managers thought it was a good or bad thing for their portfolio holdings for consumer technology and media businesses if it could happen in germany why not in any other country a headline about a german regulator s action on a u s company triggered stock market activity across the world alright i know iam on thin ice here without offering proof i am claiming that fund managers bought and sold stocks globally in various businesses based on these three pieces of news i have no idea if my specific claim about these three news items is valid but there is no denying that mutual funds have become more trigger happy over the years according to a 2018 morgan stanley report titled long term conviction in a short term world the average holding period of mutual funds had fallen to less than one year from seven years in 1960 1 funds are not being bought and sold in a vacuum fund managers decide to buy or sell based on something often that something is the latest news from a highly reputed and reliable financial newspaper i will let you figure out the impact of the two remaining news items on my list they were on emerging market capital flows and the rising raw material costs in the solar power industry it shouldn t be too hard based on what i discussed in chapter 4 proximate and ultimate causes of success and the title of section iii which advises to be very lazy you will correctly conclude that we did not react to any of these five pieces of news in june 2021 our activity was zero but couldn t we have been wrong why should i not have adjusted my indian portfolio based on the fed s interest rate outlook many of our portfolio companies import goods from china shouldn t we have sold them since their profits were certain to get squeezed and why didn t we tinker with even one of our three internet businesses which enjoy a virtual monopoly in their respective markets after all couldn t the indian regulator have followed the footsteps of its german counterpart and what could be more worrying for us than the specter of declining capital flows to india i will get to these answers but before that let s examine a different kind of news flow that hits much closer to home and is much harder to ignore unceasing upheavals can be upsetting we have seen the potential stock market effect of only a few news items on a single day from a single newspaper yet this phenome non repeats itself day after day actually moment to moment across newspapers tv channels social media platforms whispers from brokers and fund managers and heaven knows what else notwithstanding special purpose acquisition companies spacs and wework fund managers invest in real businesses with real money instead of studying generic news as we have just done what if we track the news flow of a single company over time let s do a brief thought experiment assume you are a long term investor in early january 2009 in the middle of the global financial crisis you chose to invest in the french company l oréal the world s largest and most successful cosmetics company your view was that a quality business like l oréal should be able to overcome any short term pains owing to the financial crisis you paid about 60 per share because you are a long term investor you plan to own the business for many years over the next few years apart from the

how l oréal doubles e commerce growth in a pandemic done ok first question would you have stayed invested at the end of 2009 all five headlines look worrisome let s look at three of them first ebay seems to have scored a significant victory over l oréal in the uk courts which ruled that ebay was not responsible for any counterfeit products sold on its website could this ruling lead to l oréal losing the e commerce race second even more worrisome the danish consumer council declared that biotherm a l oréal skin product contained harmful substances what kind of reputational and real damage would the company suffer in other parts of europe third l oréal s chair is embroiled in a legal battle among the family members who own l oréal sir lindsay owen jones the chair had allegedly received about 100 million from liliane bettencourt who owned 31 percent of the company in return for his long service as an investor should we be worried that the chair might be distracted given the public nature of the feud let s examine the potentially damaging events of 2011 the regulator has fined l oréal for price fixing and banned many of its advertisements and the financial results for the second quarter clearly show that the company has been unable to pass higher costs on to consumers thereby suffering lower margins does this indicate that l oréal is finally losing its brand power and that the competition has caught up owen jones has resigned abruptly although his term wasn t expiring until 2014 he was widely acknowledged as the key driving force behind the company s global success and was one of france s most respected business lead ers he delivered double digit profit growth for almost two decades when he was the company s ceo from 1988 to 2006 should you be selling your stake in l oréal because it will be hard for a new leader to emulate him or should you be buying more if the price reacts negatively as you glance through table 8 1 you will notice dozens of such news items that point to a potentially significant event in the company s life some may even seem self contradictory for example in august 2013 l oréal made an aggressive bid to acquire a chinese company but by january 2014 the company appears to have pulled back from china by stopping the sale of its garnier brand then in june 2015 the company cut prices aggressively in a blatant attempt to gain market share we don t invest in france but if we did should we have reacted to these headlines if not why and if so how by studying kurtén s bears and darwin s finches evolution is not what it seems the metaphor never judge a book by its cover should also apply to bland research articles with titles like rates of evolution in fossil mammals contrary to what you would expect from this title this article in my layperson s opinion is one of the most ex citing in the history of the development of evolutionary theory in 1959 exactly a century after the publication of darwin s origin a finnish scientist named bjérn kurtén published this article in a biology journal 2 instead of celebrating darwinism s centenary kurtén poked a seemingly large hole in it to compre hend kurtén s stunning claim we need to revisit darwin s assertion in origin i do believe that natural selection will always act very slowly often only at long intervals of time and generally only on a very few of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time i further believe that this prolonged intermittent action of natu ral selection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of this world have changed as we learned in chapter 5 darwin was inspired by the famous geologist charles lyell who proposed the theory of unifor mitarianism lyell contended that the earth has slowly and uniformly changed over the millennia and that understanding the present is key to interpreting the past he directly contradicted the prevailing theory of catastrophism which suggested that the features of the earth like mountains resulted from extensive and sudden changes or catastrophes darwin applied lyell s theory of geological evolution to the biological world he believed that just as the earth evolves slowly over very long periods so does the world of animals and plants the upshot of darwin s insight is that if we were to measure the pace of evolution it would correlate proportionately with the measurement period it would be slow over brief periods and fast over long periods darwin s theory stressed that species evolve slowly this idea was gospel until kurtén s article was published in 1959 kurtén plotted the evolution of the length of the second lower molar of the brown bear in europe during the pleistocene epoch between 2 6 million and 11 700 years ago let s examine the data in table 8 2 for the rate of change of the molar measured in darwins one darwin is a change of 1 1000 in 1 000 years and the period of measurement table 8 2 the inverse relationship between measurement period and evolutionary change measurement period years rate of change darwins 400 000 0 41 100 000 0 90 80 000 0 76 50 000 2 20 22 000 3 20 8 000 13 8 do you see a trend here kurtén s data show that evolution appeared to occur quite quickly when measured over short periods and slowly when the measurement period was prolonged thus when measured over 400 000 years the rate of change of the molar was 0 41 darwins but over 8 000 years the rate of change was an astounding 13 8 darwins he demonstrated a similar trend in other fossilized mammalian species including horses i was incredulous when i first read about kurtén s conclusion suppose we accept the darwinian notion that the current diversity of the world is the result of species transforming slowly but surely throughout the eons how is it possible that the pace of evolution is slower over more extended periods and faster over shorter periods kurtén s article was not an outlier in a 2009 article titled rates of evolution philip d gingerich a paleontologist at the university of michigan also supported kurtén s claim 2 he demonstrated mathematically and empirically that phenotypic change ie changes in the bodily characteristics of a species could be rapid from one generation to the next in contrast evolution can be slow on long time scales does this inverse correlation between the rate of change of bodily parts and the time interval of measurement also apply to genes it does simon ho an australian evolutionary biologist and his colleagues provide an excellent overview of this seem ingly un darwinian phenomenon in their 2011 article time dependent rates of molecular evolution they summarize the research done by several scientists on the genomes of humans insects birds fish and even bacteria and viruses most of this re search points in the same direction contrary to expectation the pace of genetic evolution is inversely correlated with the period of measurement the grants take it one step further all the research studies mentioned so far have examined evolution over hundreds or thousands of years do these conclusions also apply over a few years or decades we now return to peter boag and laurene ratcliffe who had been stunned by the result of their analysis of darwin s finches both dead and living on the small island of daphne major in the galapagos they witnessed what no one had seen before natural selection and evolution occurring in real time in two species of finches as boag stated in his famous 1981 science article the in tensity of natural selection in the birds was the highest yet recorded for a vertebrate population fossils show that evolution has occurred and darwin s irrefutable logic argues that natural selection can drive evolution however no one had ever seen natural selection and evolution in action darwin didn t think it was even possible in 1893 the german evolutionary biologist august weismann wrote it is very difficult to imagine this process of natural selection in its details and to this day it is impossible to demonstrate it in any one point author s emphasis in their book the variation of animals in nature the british evolutionary biologists guy c robson and owain w richards wrote in 1936 in darwin s treatment of the subject no proof is adduced that a selective process has ever been detected in na ture it is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs for biological science that a first class theory should still dominate the field of in quiry though largely held on faith or rejected on account of prejudice the unsatisfactory state of affairs had finally ended boag and ratcliffe s observations changed the field of evolution forever they were part of a long term project started by peter and rosemary grant a married british couple and currently emeritus pro fessors at princeton the grants wanted to study evolution in the wild and discover the key factors that lead to new species so they decided to study darwin s finches also called galapagos finches figure 8 1 provides illustrations of four species of finches out of a total of fourteen that have adapted and evolved from one mother species that landed on the galapagos islands two to three mil lion years ago 1 geospiza magnirostris 2 geospiza fortis 3 geospiza parvula 4 certhidea olivacea 8 1 four of the fourteen species of darwin s finches note the difference in the size and shape of their beaks which have adapted to the flora and fauna of the various gal4pagos islands this phenomenon in which a single species evolves into many species adapted to specialized modes of life is called adaptive radiation source licensed from science photo library the grants landed on the island daphne major in 1973 to start their project 2 as i shared in chapter 5 darwin had visited the galapagos in 1835 the galapagos group of islands is almost one thousand kilometers off the west coast of ecuador owing to its remote location it is home to several endemic species i e species not found anywhere else in the world there are about a dozen central and minor islands in the archipelago daphne major is small nondescript and remote even by the standards of galapagos darwin did not even see it and mea sures barely a square kilometer in area the next time i feel like complaining about the firmness of the mattress or the softness of the pillows in a hotel room i hope i remember what the grants endured on daphne major for six months every year for forty consecutive years before the grants and their research staff made it their home no humans had lived there how could they there is only one way to enter the island and that is the base ofa cliff since the island has no shoreline to set up their camp every year here is what the grants had to do they had to abandon their boat as they neared the island and approach the cliff base at low tide in a rowboat called a panga a single black ledge filled with barnacles was their only landing point it s the size of a large exercise mat they needed to leap onto this mat while the panga swayed wildly in the ocean waves from here they had to walk up the cliff on hard wet rocks until they arrived at another ledge that they called the landing then they formed a human chain and passed up tents poles water food and everything else they would need for the next six months daphne major has no water or food they could pitch their tents only at one spot which was the size of a table and on the rim ofa volcano they had to lug all their supplies there from the base of the cliff they cooked their meals in a small cave protected from the harsh sun by a sheet of cloth once settled they would spend the next six months measuring the body size beak size and beak shape of every finch on the island they would also extract blood to do a genetic analysis why would anyone in their right mind spend time on such an island because it offered many advantages that few other places could daphne major was so far removed from the other islands that there was only a minimal chance that the finches or other island species could escape or that new ones could arrive it was a perfect petri dish for evolutionary studies because it would not get contaminated also the grants realized that the galapagos were a gold mine for testing and refining darwin s theory the galapagos islands undergo extreme climate swings from severe drought to copious rain thereby providing ample opportunity for natural selection last daphne major was small enough to track every bird that lives there over many years which they did from 1973 to 2012 the grants tagged about twenty thousand birds over eight generations and they tracked almost every copulat ing pair and their offspring in the first four years of their study from 1973 to 1976 the island received average or excess rainfall but in 1977 after a brief spell of rain in january daphne major suffered a severe drought almost all the greenery disappeared from the island and the only plants that survived the drought were cactus bushes the finches fed on seeds of all sizes the small and medium sized seeds disappeared very soon and the finches were then left with only large and hard seeds but only the finches with larger beaks could break open these larger seeds finches with small and medium sized beaks could not open these seeds and so starved and perished the island was inhabited mainly by two species at the start of 1977 there were about 1 200 geospiza fortis and 280 geospiza scandens by the end of the year only 180 fortis and 110 scandens were left about 85 percent of the fortis and 60 percent of the scandens had succumbed to the drought the grants data showed that the surviving fortis were on average 5 to 6 percent larger than the ones that had died the average beak length of the survivors was 11 07 millimeters compared to 10 68 millimeters for the species before the drought the average beak depth had increased from 9 42 millimeters to 9 96 millimeters these differences may appear small to us but they can tilt the balance between life and death in the wild for example a fortis with a beak length of 11 millimeters can crack a seed from a plant called a caltrop but an individual with a beak length of 10 5 millimeters will not even attempt to do so just half a mil limeter can make all the difference the intensity of natural selection the grants observed wasn t limited just to beak length and depth at the start of 1977 there were 600 male and 600 female fortis by the end of the drought more than 150 males and only a few females were alive the males are typically larger than the females by about 5 percent so the males were more likely to survive there were now six males to every female natural selection can occur in a single generation but evolution takes place only over many generations given the dramatic change in the beak size and sex ratio of the finches natural selection had happened but what about evolution the grants had to wait one more year to measure the beak size and shape of the offspring of the drought survivors of 1977 but then they saw evolu tion in action too the new generation was 4 to 5 percent larger than the population before the onset of the drought they soon realized that their observation of 1977 was not a fluke in 1983 there was a very heavy rainfall because of el nirio and the island became lush and green green vines covered even the cactus bushes this changed vegetation had a signifi cant impact two years later when drought struck again this time tiny seeds were abundant produced by the vines of 1983 and large seeds became rare as a result the finches with large beaks found it hard to pick up the seeds and a large proportion of the survivors of this drought were the small beaked finches their offspring as a result also had smaller beaks natural selection and evolution were evident again except that unlike in 1977 the beaks had evolved to become smaller thus in less than a decade the finches beak size increased and then decreased because of natural selection when observed over a decade beak size may not have appeared to change that much but it had fluctuated significantly in the intervening period owing to the two extreme climate events the grants published the results of their long term study of the evolution of the two species of finches fortis and scandens in science in april 2002 under the title unpredictable evolution in a 30 year study of darwin s finches before starting their research they had hypothesized that the body traits of the finches would vary within a narrow band over the period of the study but as they say at the beginning of the article the data do not support the expectation of no change if you examine the graphs of the body size beak size and beak shape of fortis and scandens in the grants article you will notice the inverse correlation between the measurement period and the pace of evolution pointed out by kurtén in brown bears thus while the body size of fortis fluctuated a lot between the mid 1980s and the early 2000s the overall change over those two decades was small similarly the annual variation of the beak size of scandens appeared to be much greater than the variation from the mid 1970s until the early 2000s the beak shape of fortis was practically the same when measured in the mid 1980s and the early 2000s but its annual change was much more significant there is a lovely fractal like property to this phenomenon it does not seem to matter if the measurement period is thou sands of years bears or just a few decades finches the pace of evolution speeds up over shorter periods and slows down over more extended periods but so what why should long term investors care about kurtén s bears and the grants finches the grants and kurtén dictate when we buy and sell my observations are nowhere as scientific as the grants or kurtén s however i know that the daily weekly monthly and quar terly rate of change in exceptional businesses appears much greater than the rate of change measured over years and decades this realization has helped me formulate an investing principle that i call the grant kurtén principle of investing gkpi it goes as follows when we find high quality businesses that do not fundamentally alter their character over the long term we should exploit the inevitable short term fluctuations in their businesses for buying and not selling gkpi requires us to own high quality businesses that do not fundamentally alter their character over the long term high qual ity businesses is a loaded term and can mean different things to different investors if you have come this far i assume you know our definition for us the critical character traits of a high quality business are stellar operating and financial track records a sta ble industry a high governance standard a defensible moat increasing market share and low business and financial risk how do we use gkpi for buying by exploiting short term fluctuations we are highly demanding we want a company to be run by an honest management team and show solid operating and financial track records over many years it needs to stay ahead of the competition and be debt free and we also want it to keep taking calculated risks while not unduly burdening the business and as if all these demands were not enough we dare to insist on a fair price for these rare gems how is this even possible the market should almost never offer us an attractive price for such a business and it doesn t however on rare occasions investors who don t subscribe to gkpi succumb to the pressure of temporary macro industry or company issues and we can then swoop in to buy a piece of an exceptional company it doesn t and shouldn t happen often but when it does we go all in take wns one of our largest investments to date it is one of india s leading business process outsourcing bpo companies and is listed on the new york stock exchange it was set up in 1996 as a captive back office by british airways and started serving third party clients in 1999 in 2002 warburg pincus acquired a controlling stake in wns i wasn t involved in the deal although british airways contributed to about 90 percent of wns s revenues at the time of acquisition by warburg pincus in 2002 its rev enue share had fallen to less than 10 percent by early 2008 the management at wns had done a stellar job of diversifying away from british airways and the travel industry by outsourcing back office functions like finance and accounting mortgage process ing and customer analytics wns s clients typically get higher quality service e g faster turnaround times lower error rates at a much lower cost in january 2008 the stock price of wns fell sharply from a previous high of 35 to 13 three factors seemed to have contributed to this steep correction first one of its large mortgage lender clients first magnus declared bankruptcy in late 2007 owing to the ongoing subprime mortgage crisis in the united states first magnus had contributed to about 5 percent of wns s revenue so the management lowered its revenue guidance for the next year second the management indicated that it may lose aviva a large insurance client that was contributing to about 8 percent of wns s revenue by may 2008 if aviva were to acquire the wns facility servicing it and third the appreciating rupee had the analysts worried since most of wns s delivery presence was in india a stronger rupee could make wns less competitive and squeeze margins the question for us was this was this a temporary blip or was it a more permanent decline of achievable revenue and profit growth we decided it was the former the loss of first magnus wasn t wns s fault and even the potential loss of aviva would be due to aviva s change of strategy not because wns wasn t serving it well also we didn t believe wns s long term competitive advantage would be adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations wns s annualized revenue growth of 64 percent from 2004 to 2007 was proof that it offered high quality back office processing services to its clients at competitive prices also we love the indian bpo industry it is lucrative for well established incumbents because it has high entry barriers for new entrants businesses are extremely wary of outsourcing their mission critical applications to a start up and high exit barriers for existing clients wns and other leading players almost never lose a customer given the sticky nature of back office process ing iassume you have heard the song hotel california by the eagles the song s last line you can check out any time you like but you can never leave applies to the clients of the leading companies in the indian bpo industry wns was and is in a great place the bottom line was that despite the market pessimism we had no reason to believe that anything fundamental had changed at the company we bought aggressively and invested 41 million in early 2008 at an average price of 15 2 per share by march 2022 the stock price 85 5 had gained 462 percent whereas the indian indexes the sensex as well as the midcap index had gained only 97 percent in dollars then almost exactly twelve years after our initial investment in wns in early 2008 we got an opportunity to buy again during the early days of pandemic panic from march to may 2020 we invested an additional 98 million in the business at an av erage price of 46 1 per share just when the markets seemed to think that the world was ending some gifts just keep on giving how do we use gkpi for selling by ignoring short term fluctuations if we get lucky by owning a high quality business like wns gkpi requires us not to sell why because as shown by the grants and kurtén short term changes do not usually impact the long term character of an exceptional enterprise let s revisit l oréal to marvel at the beauty of gkpi table 8 3 provides a snapshot of the business in 2009 and 2020 2 if you go through the annual reports for these years you will get a sense of déja vu the language the

during this period its top two divisions consumer and luxury accounted for about 80 percent of sales even the critical brands across divisions remained essentially unchanged l oréal continued to bea cash machine which allowed it to become a cash surplus company in 2020 after being indebted in 2009 one significant change during this period seems to be the dramatic growth in asia mainly china the revenue contribution from asia increased from 13 percent to 35 percent from 2009 to 2020 but this was not a sudden change as is evident from the trend of the company s asian revenue contribution to total revenues from 2009 to 2020 13 percent 18 percent 19 percent 21 percent 21 percent 21 percent 22 percent 22 percent 24 percent 27 percent 32 percent and 35 percent aside from 2010 and 2019 asia s revenue contribution inched up by only 0 to 3 percentage points every year steady as she went let s revisit where you were earlier back in 2009 you had bought l oréal stock for 60 per share if you were a follower of gkpi you would have ignored every piece of bad news listed in table 8 1 instead you would have seen these news items for what they were unimportant and irrelevant for the long term performance of the business in fact at some points in this journey you may have chosen to load up on more shares when you found the price attractive where do you think the stock price was at the end of june 2022 it was 329 per share so your gain would have been 450 percent which handsomely beat the french cac 40 index which grew only 80 percent during this period this is not a recommendation to buy l oréal but it is a tribute to the proper application of gkpi you would have done spec tacularly well by doing nothing gkpi is our religion and it reflects in all kinds of big and small ways in the way we work our office doesn t have a tv screen playing cnbc or any other news our lone tv screen is used only for video conferencing the only bloomberg terminal we have is in the corner of our office pantry it remains unused and unwatched probably 99 percent of the time we never discuss recent company news or share prices in our team meetings i mainly read physical newspapers in which the information is always one day late we have never bought or sold a single business based on news flow and never will gkpi demands that we be lazy when buying and very lazy when selling and so we are it has led to some decent outcomes for us in june 2022 excluding purchases during the previous two years we owned twenty eight businesses in one of these busi nesses we made more than one hundred times our money page in two of them we multiplied our money more than twenty five times berger and ratnamani and in six of them we made more than ten times our money in indian rupees unfortunately all nine have suffered small but significant setbacks some of which lasted many years e g ratnamani and page however our ad herence to gkpi ensured that we didn t panic exercised patience and stayed lazy why and when we sell if gkpi requires that we not sell then why do we we don t sell on valuation a key reason many investors throw up their hands and exit that is because we have no target price for selling in our portfolio i have sold on valuation only once i behaved foolishly and regret it even today i will discuss this folly in chapter 10 so let s ignore it for the moment we sell under the following three conditions the numbers in parentheses indicate the number of businesses sold 1 a decline in governance standards 0 2 egregiously wrong capital allocation 3 3 irreparable damage to the business 6 we have sold ten businesses since 2007 the nine listed here plus the mistake i am excluding three businesses that strategic buyers acquired this translates to one exit every one and a half years how s that for laziness as you can see six of our nine exits occurred because we believed the business had been damaged beyond repair and how did we come to that conclusion an example can clarify we had invested in an old world manufacturing business that was the leader in an oligopolistic industry in india it ticked all the boxes enviable governance standard impeccable financials stable industry zero leverage and we were able to buy at what we thought was an attractive price everything was hunky dory for the first couple years however in the third year of our owner ship we were surprised to see that the business lost market share for two quarters in a row we spent time with the management to understand the reasons and after some initial resistance they agreed that there might have been some temporary share loss however they were confident that this was a transitory phenomenon but it wasn t the company kept losing market share and in one of the smaller but highly profitable segments its share loss accelerated over the next few quarters again the management seemed to have a compelling set of explanations all of which sounded logical they claimed they had made many changes to their manufacturing sales and marketing practices and that we would see the trend reverse soon but the loss of market share continued we waited for three more years after spotting the initial trouble and finally decided to pull the plug since we want to be permanent owners we demand a high performance standard in both absolute and relative terms when we exited this business was delivering decent results about 35 percent roce with modest revenue and profit growth but we did not want to be owners in a business that consistently fell behind the competition during those three years of waiting for the business to improve several positive and negative news reports were made about the company we ignored the news and focused on the trend in actual market share why did we hold the business for three more years after detecting the problem why did we not sell sooner because gkpi tells us that we should expect ups and downs in every business there isn t a single business in our portfolio that has gone up ina straight line not one over the long run most businesses in our portfolio have done well but every business has gyrated wildly in both directions when measured over weeks or quarters our default option is to overlook these temporary business upheavals however in some cases like the one i ve discussed here what we think is temporary becomes more permanent fortunately there have been only six such occasions in our history therefore our default option will always be to continue to respect gkpi remember that the maximum we can lose is our investment amount but there is no limit to how high a share price can climb given the quality of businesses in our portfolio we prefer to run the risk of selling late and losing some capital than selling early and forgoing substantial gain a lot can happen over sixty years or can it we apply evolutionary thinking by ignoring both small and big setbacks in our businesses to focus on the long term despite the l oréal example and our experience applying gkpi the skeptical part of your brain should raise two valid questions 1 how long is long term and 2 since new businesses keep destroying old ones won t we be left with only failed businesses after a few decades if we keep holding on a headline on the website of the american enterprise institute from october 2015 can help us answer these questions it reads fortune 500 firms in 1955 v 2015 only 12 remain thanks to the creative destruction that fuels economic prosper ity 2 the article goes on to list the sixty one u s companies that had survived sixty years on the list contrary to the article s tone which mourns the seemingly significant schumpeterian destruction i was pleasantly sur prised that sixty one companies had stayed on the list for sixty years i would have guessed the number to be much smaller the period from 1955 to 2015 was tumultuous and unpredictable for the united states and the world also the world of 2015 seemed almost unrecognizable from that of 1955 during those sixty years we witnessed the start and the end of the cold war the splintering of the ussr the advent of the space age the u s civil rights act the oil shock the savings and loans crisis multiple crises in the middle east the meteoric rise of china the formation of the european union the internet boom and bust the exponential growth of mobile phones innumerable wars across the globe the global financial crisis of 2008 the increasing dominance of technology firms and the rapid digitization of all businesses i haven t stated at least a hundred more significant events that also would have impacted companies of all sizes in the united states however companies like 3m alcoa avon caterpillar kellogg pepsi pfizer and many others did much better than simply endure these massive local and global shocks they also prospered by maintaining their position in the top five hun dred companies in the country but this number sixty one was understated first there was a factual error the author missed eleven businesses that ap peared on both lists companies including colgate palmolive corning h j heinz and ppg it was probably just an oversight thus seventy two companies should appear on both lists the second reason for understatement was that the author did not count the businesses that had been acquired by a fortune 500 business between 1955 and 2015 let s take gillette in 2005 p g acquired gillette for 57 billion gillette remained a for tune 500 business for fifty years after 1955 its rank was 215 when it was acquired should we consider gillette to be a failure was it creatively destroyed i don t think so i used their overpriced blades just this morning since it was a part of p g which was ranked 32 on the fortune 500 list of 2015 i would also consider gillette to be on the fortune 500 list of 2015 united technologies acquired otis in 1975 and so otis stayed on the list for twenty years after 1955 united technologies was ranked 45 on the 2015 fortune 500 list and i could reasonably argue that otis should be counted as a continuing business as a part of united technologies we can reach the same conclusion for businesses like wrigley quaker oats carrier bestfoods and mcdonnell douglas acquired by the fortune 500 companies berkshire hathaway pepsico united technologies unilever and boe ing respectively there are seventy three companies like gillette and otis from the fortune 500 list of 1955 acquired by the fortune 500 companies of 2015 here i have also included the larger overseas acquirers like bp and unilever who if they were in the united states would have been a part of the fortune 500 in 2015 thus one hundred forty five businesses from 1955 could be included on the 2015 list seventy two that survived and seventy three that have become part of the survivors from 1955 sixty three companies either went bankrupt or were untraceable finding companies from the 1950s and 1960s is not easy they were a part of the destruction process of capitalism what happened to the remaining two hundred ninety two businesses 500 145 63 from the fortune 500 list of 1955 they either fell out of the top 500 or were acquired by or merged with other companies does that mean that all of them failed some may not have done well but many may have continued to survive and prosper there are a jot of high quality businesses that aren t in the fortune 500 which by definition is a highly restrictive list for example eaton ranked 189 in 1955 and fell out of the fortune 500 in 2013 in june 2021 its market value was 60 billion so i wouldn t label it as a failure also it stayed on the list for fifty eight years after 1955 which is no mean achievement borden chemical was acquired by the private equity giants kkr in 1995 and then by apollo in 2004 borden exists even today as part of hexion specialty chemicals usg a building products company on the fortune 500 list of 1955 was acquired by knauf of germany revenue of 10 billion for 7 billion in 2018 if we assume that 20 to 25 percent of these two hundred ninety two businesses were acquired or fell out of the fortune 500 of 1955 but continued to successfully deliver their products and services we get an additional sixty to seventy five businesses from the 1955 list that have been successful thus the summary of the longevity of the fortune 500 businesses of 1955 is as follows 72 companies 14 percent continued to be a part of the fortune 500 for sixty years 73 businesses 15 percent became a part of a fortune 500 business by 2015 60 to 75 companies 12 15 percent continued to do well despite being acquired or falling out of the fortune 500 280 to 295 55 to 60 percent of the firms on the 1955 list failed in chapters 9 and 10 i present the results of a study of the change in stock prices of listed u s firms over ninety years from 1926 to 2016 it shows that about 60 percent of the listed stocks delivered less than u s treasury returns over the ninety years hence my estimation of a 55 to 60 percent failure rate over sixty years as calculated earlier is probably on the higher side any way let s stick with it we can safely assume that the 1955 fortune 500 businesses were high quality businesses of course they may not have been high quality strictly according to our definition e g some may have had modest debt levels but there is no denying that they were extraordinary companies they couldn t have become some of the largest businesses in the mecca of capitalism with out being outstanding we have seen that at least 30 percent 72 73 145 of these continued to be high quality as evidenced by remaining in the top 500 for sixty years if we include companies that may have done well over this period despite not being part of the elite 500 in the year 2015 about sixty to seventy five businesses we see that 40 to 45 percent two hundred five to two hundred twenty of companies from the 1955 fortune 500 list performed well over sixty years this is not a small number capitalism and creative de struction do work well but not that well so here are the answers to the two questions i posed at the start of this section first long term is genuinely long term at least five decades maybe more and second new businesses do replace old ones but at a far slower rate than we think this brings us back to the lesson from the grants and kurtén there is no point wasting time energy and brainpower on worrying about day to day upheavals in high quality businesses they can be highly resilient over the long term so why sell 2k kodak was the facebook or google of its day just like these two current giants you would not have found it easy to name the sec ond player in photography in 1976 kodak held a 90 percent market share in film sales and an 85 percent market share in the sale of cameras 1 and today smartphones are synonymous with cameras kodak is effectively dead ironically an american electrical engineer at kodak steve sasson invented the first digital camera in 1975 if we were analyzing kodak in 1975 we would have concluded that the film industry was remarkably stable and that kodak s dominance was unlikely to be tested for the foreseeable future would i have sold after witnessing the dramatic growth of digital photography maybe maybe not i am not sure but ido know that i would have reacted late and may have lost money as a result is there a solution to this problem how do i know that ignoring this particular small event will work out in the long run i don t let me restate what i have mentioned before all investing models have downsides in my opinion no investment strategy is foolproof if you know of one that is please write a book on it or better still email me the magic formula our application of gkpi will have kodak like downsides but in my experience it works well most of the time and that s the best we can expect of any model an antelope is swift agile and alert and almost impossible to catch but many do get caught and killed by cheetahs leopards and lions does it mean that the antelope s design is flawed not at all the antelope is very well adapted to its environment not all will live to old age but enough will thereby allowing the species to survive for millions of years we have applied gkpi consistently to every business we have invested in but not all have prospered however as a portfolio this approach has worked exceedingly well for us this species has survived very well chapter summary evolutionary theory has taught me that we can reimagine investing by embracing the tenet that the long term character of high quality businesses remains unaffected by short term fluctuations in the economy the industry and even the business 1 contrary to the expectations of darwinism evolution can be faster when measured over shorter periods and slower over longer periods bjérn kurtén demonstrated this phenomenon in the evolution of the teeth of european brown bears 2 high quality businesses too seem to undergo many changes when measured over days or weeks or months but are much more stable when the period of measurement is years or decades 3 empirical data from the longevity of fortune 500 businesses demonstrate the long term resilience of exceptional busi nesses about 40 to 45 percent of the fortune 500 businesses of 1955 continued to be successful for the next sixty years 4 we have capitalized on the inevitable short term fluctuations in high quality businesses to invest at attractive valuations however since these opportunities arise infrequently we rarely ever buy we are lazy 5 after investing we ignore near term fluctuations because the fundamental characteristics of stellar businesses remain sta ble over the long term we never sell on valuation we are very lazy 6 we have sold only when there had been an egregiously bad capital allocation or irreparable damage to a business chapter 9 eldredge and gould dredge up investing gold why should not nature have taken a leap from structure to structure on the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand why she should not for natural selection can act only by taking advantage of slight successive variations she can never take a leap but must ad vance by the shortest slowest steps charles darwin on the origin of species chapter 6 difficulties of the theory charlie and i decided long ago that in an investment lifetime it s just too hard to make hundreds of smart decisions that judgment became ever more compelling as berkshire s capital mushroomed and the universe of investments that could significantly affect our results shrank dramatically therefore we adopted a strategy that required our being smart and not too smart at that only a very few times indeed we ll now settle for one good idea a year charlie says it s my turn warren buffett annual letter to shareholders 1993 ook back upon your life yes i know you will need to stop reading to reflect on the years gone by please do so and con template the events or moments that have made you you life work business all of it go ahead take a deep breath pause and roll that reel backward done all right what did you see let me share the snippets of my movie most of my five decades on this glorious planet seem to have passed in a blur i could remember only a few moments spontaneously when my mother cried on losing her mother when my history teacher praised me when my father allowed me to drive his car when the first company i interviewed for re jected me when a herd of elephants chased us on a safari in south africa when the first company i invested in had a successful ipo when i first saw my newborn son when i well you get the picture i may be able to list maybe thirty such events but not three thousand it seems a bit odd since i have been alive for about thirty million minutes where are the remaining minutes were they all uninteresting is my life nothing but a long period of nothingness punctuated by moments to remember what about your life and what about life on our planet some moments may not be forgotten even a century from now one came on january 11 2020 when the chinese media reported the first death of a person a sixty one year old man from an unknown virus he had been a regular at the local seafood and poultry market in the city of wuhan within less than two weeks dozens of countries across the world started reporting infections from the same virus on january 30 the world health or ganization declared a global health emergency and on february 11 it named the disease caused by the virus covid 19 in march 2020 the world witnessed what it never had before a complete global shutdown future generations will accuse us of photoshopping images of the empty streets of mumbai london rome and new york in 2020 and no photograph will capture the scale or depth of human suffering and hardship every equity market in the world started falling precipitously and in the months of march and april there seemed to be no end to the bottom the indian sensex crashed 23 percent in march 2020 what were we at nalanda to do in these unprecedented times maybe evolutionary theory could give us a hint the absence of evidence is evidence of absence in 1972 the paleontologists stephen jay gould and niles eldredge published an essay that seemed to blow a reasonably large hole in the tower of classical darwinism darwin s theory of natural selection makes a robust case for phyletic gradualism darwin theorized that natural selection eliminates unfit individuals so that only the better adapted will reproduce if this continues long enough a new species is im perceptibly created and the original species goes extinct he makes his view on gradualism explicit in the concluding chapter of origin as natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight successive favourable variations it can produce no great or sudden modification it can act only by very short and slow steps if this is accurate we should find intermediate forms of species in the fossil record providing evidence of phyletic gradu alism let s take the example of whales which evolved about fifty million years ago from a four legged land dwelling vertebrate called pakicetus 1 figure 9 1 lists some descendants of pakicetus including ambulocetus remingtoncetus protocetus and dorudon which ultimately evolved into current day whales and dolphins given the large size of whales we should find hundreds maybe even thousands of intermediate forms the problem is that we don t for example where are the intermediate fossils between remingtoncetus and protocetus we have a decent fossil record that helped paleontologists piece together the puzzle of whale evolu tion but we don t have most of the transitional forms artiodactyla pakicetidae l_ _remingtoncetus protocetus basilosaurus mysticeti bales 65 60 55 50 54085 30 million years ago paleocene eocene oligocene miocene 9 1 the evolution of whales where are the other transitional forms source licensed from science photo library i discussed the evolution of giraffes in chapter 5 if natural selection exterminated giraffes with shorter necks over time and the longer necked ones evolved gradually why have we not found giraffe fossils with necks ranging from very short to very long given that we haven t how can anyone claim that evolution proceeds gradually and not suddenly intellect and integrity are mutually exclusive traits one does not guarantee the other however darwin was that rare genius who was also unsparingly honest he penned an entire chapter on the potential problems with his theory he starts chapter 6 of origin difficulties of the theory by stating an obvious issue with the idea of natural selection he argues that since natural selection gradually eliminates minor well adapted forms extinction and natural selection must operate simultaneously hence logic dictates that innumerable transitional forms that were unable to adapt to their surroundings should have existed but as darwin himself points out transitional fossils have rarely been found he admits that the incomplete fossil record poses a signifi cant hurdle to anyone trying to prove that species evolve gradually but he had a solution he asserted that the geological record is incomplete he stated the geological record is imperfect and this fact will to a large extent explain why we do not find interminable varieties connecting all the extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps he who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record will rightly reject my whole theory emphasis mine he considered the issue of a lack of transitional forms so devastating to the theory of natural selection that he went on to devote chapter 9 of origin to a discussion of just this one problem aptly titled on the imperfection of the geological record he made his case by presenting several convincing arguments only a tiny portion of the earth has been geologically explored an organism with only soft parts cannot be preserved if shells and bones sink to the bottom of the sea where sediment does not accu mulate they will disappear many species like land shells existed in the distant past but hardly any fossils can be found if darwin was right about gradualism paleontologists should witness a gradual change in the fossil records over millions of years but this is not what they find instead before and since darwin a large number of paleontologists have found that the ma jority of species appear suddenly in the fossil record and then persist unchanged until they go extinct 2 hugh falconer 1808 1865 was one of the greatest paleontologists of the nineteenth century 2 he went to india as a surgeon in 1830 but spent most of his time digging up fossils he discovered ancient fossil beds in the southern himalayas and excavated several extinct species like the mastodon and saber toothed tiger he also studied the fossils of european elephants dar win had colossal respect for falconer and sent him a copy of the first edition of origin in november 1859 with a personal note falconer discovered that most fossil species remained stable over very long periods even through significant environmental changes in his 1863 monograph after describing that the mammoths had experienced extreme changes of climate he wonders if species are so unstable and so susceptible to mutations through such influences why does that extinct form stand out so sig nally amonument of stability in 1903 the famous paleontologist h f cleland noted a similar stasis in devonian fossils from 420 to 360 million years ago he stated a careful examination of the fossils of all the zones from the lowest to the highest failed to reveal any evolution ary changes with the possible exception of ambocoelia praeumbona the evolution of brachiopods gastropods and pelecypods either does not take place at all or takes place very seldom many other paleontologists had been making similar observations none of these practitioners defied darwin s claim of gradualism although their field observations seemed to indicate other wise this tension between theory and practice finally broke in 1972 when niles eldredge and stephen jay gould published their famous essay punctuated equilibria an alternative to phyletic gradualism they claimed that the history of the organic world could be viewed as comprising long periods of stability interspersed with brief periods during which new species emerge in the authors words as a central proposition punctuated equilibrium holds that the great majority of species as evidenced by their anatomical and geographical histories in the fossil record originate in geo logical moments punctuations and then persist in stasis throughout their long durations gould and eldredge were admonishing their peers for confusing an absence of evidence with evidence of absence gould who died in 2002 was a paleontologist at harvard university and conducted extensive research on west indian land snails eldredge now curator emeritus at the american museum of natural history specialized in trilobites which are now extinct paleontologists study fossils to learn about an organism s evolutionary history and its relationship to other organisms and its environment in fact until the rise of modern dna extraction techniques paleontology was the only science capable of studying ancient life but even the latest and most modern dna extraction techniques can study samples of only up to about a million years old 5 so fossils and hence paleontology are our only reliable window onto the ancient past gould and eldredge s brilliant insight pointed out what may seem obvious now the gaps in the fossil record were not a bug but a vital feature of the evolution of species they declared that when paleontologists found a sudden change in the morphology of a particular species they should assume that there had been a sudden change in morphology and not make the darwinian error of trying to explain away this sudden change by invoking gaps in the fossil record according to them the absence of evidence of intermediate forms is evidence of their absence therefore there was no need to take refuge in the theory of the imperfection of the fossil record if a brief punctuation followed a prolonged stasis we should not find any intermediate forms because there aren t any in their seminal article gould presented evidence of sudden evolutionary change after long periods of stasis by analyzing the evolution of a bermudan snail poecilozonites bermudensis over three hundred thousand years into three species p b fasolti p b sieglindae and p b bermudensis he showed that sharp morphological differences in these three species as measured by differences in color the form of their spire the thickness of the shell and the shape of the apertural lip did not arise gradually instead they came about owing to a punctuation event of allopatric speciation i e a new species arising as a result of the geographic isola tion of a small group of individuals from their parent species similarly eldredge outlined the evolutionary history of a trilobite species phacops rana and presented evidence for the drastic changes in eye morphology of the various subspecies of p rana aris ing out of punctuation events not through gradual evolution after eldredge and gould published their pathbreaking article on the fossils of snails and trilobites scientists discovered more examples of evolution through punctuated equilibrium across all of life including animals plants bacteria and even viruses although whether viruses are life is debatable box 9 1 there is no contradiction here punctuated equilibrium seems to contradict the observations made by kurtén and others as described in the previous chapter kurtén had shown that the rate of change in organisms is higher over the short term and is lower over the long term but the theory of punctuated equilibrium asserts that living things change dramatically i e create new species after a long period of stasis what s going on if you read carefully you will notice that these theories actually comple ment each other kurtén s observations were for a single species over thousands of years and the changes observed were within rea sonable limits the grants beak measurements were spread over a few decades and the variations in beak size and shape weren t so drastic as to warrant the creation of a new species eldredge and gould on the other hand discuss the process of the creation of a new species after the original species has been in stasis for millions of years both views are correct they are explaining different phenomena over different periods in his research article published in 1985 a l a johnson studied thirty four scallop species from the jurassic period from 200 to 145 million years ago and found copious evidence of stasis as well as an example of abrupt speciation he concluded one case was discovered where the sudden appearance of a descendant form could fairly be ascribed to rapid evolution within no more than one million years inconclusive evidence of gradual change over some twenty five million years was discovered in one of the other lineages studied but in the remaining thirty two lineages morphology appears to have been static one of the most extensive documentations of punctuated equilibrium started as a research project to refute it alan h cheetham of the smithsonian national museum of natural history in washington dc is an expert on bryozoan fossils bryozoa are tiny animals that look like worms and have tentacles on the outside they live in colonies that resemble trees or flowers he started his work on the bryozoan species metrarabdotos to illustrate gradualism cheetham measured forty six characters in sev enteen species of metrarabdotos over fifteen million years he found that eleven of the seventeen species persisted unchanged for two to six million years followed by a punctuational change over 160 000 years cheetham emphasized the remarkably clear cut evidence for a punctuated evolutionary pattern in these metrarabdotos species many such studies have found evidence of punctuated equilibrium one of the most interesting and conclusive was reported in the proceedings of the royal society in 2008 by tiina mattila and folmer bokma from umea university in sweden instead of examining fossil records mattila and bokma analyzed the change in body mass of 2 143 mammal species of a total of 4 510 extant species to assess whether their evolution was punctuated or gradual they concluded our bayesian estimates from mammals as well as separate sub clades such as primates and carnivores suggest that gradual evolution is responsible for only a small part of the body size variation between mammal species their study confirmed that punctuated equilibrium played a big part in the evolution of most mammal species body mass most research on punctuated equilibrium including that by gould and eldredge typically focuses on one species at a time in contrast mattila and bokma showed that the theory applied to the entire mammalian clade gould and eldredge s essay has turned out to be highly controversial and has many supporters and detractors 2 many re searchers have found evidence of punctuated equilibria in species evolution and others haven t found any the debates are fierce and even personal the gradualists have called the punctuated equilibria principle evolution by jerks and the other side has countered by calling the gradualist principle evolution by creeps 12 so much for scientific decency one of the most significant sources of controversy is their use of the words rapid and sudden when discussing the birth of new species the critics of punctuated equilibria accuse gould and eldredge of reviving the discredited mutationism theory of hugo de vries and the macromutation theory of richard goldschmidt goldschmidt a german born american zoologist argued in his book the material basis of evolution in 1940 that species were created not by accumulating minor variations but through significant mutations called saltations in a single generation however the scientific community has discredited this theory of sudden evolution derisively termed the theory of hopeful monsters gould has rightly argued in many of his writings that punctuated equilibrium is not saltation the theory was written for paleontologists who understand that instantaneous refers to geological time spanning tens of thousands of years and should not be confused with human time scales in his book the structure of evolutionary theory gould uses the analogy of human gesta tion as the gestation time of a human being represents 1 to 2 percent of an ordinary lifetime perhaps we should permit the same general range for punctuational speciation relative to later duration in stasis at an average lifetime of four million years a 1 per cent criterion allows forty thousand years of speciation a bizarre unintended consequence of the brouhaha among biologists was that the creationists crashed their party 12 cre ationists have always used the lack of intermediate forms in the fossil record as evidence that darwin s theory is wrong the idea of punctuated equilibrium seemed to substantiate their claim when gould and eldredge emphasized that stasis is data creation ists believe that animals and plants emerge suddenly in the fossil record because they were created instantaneously by god thus they took refuge in the theory of punctuated equilibrium which seemed to affirm the sudden emergence of species gould was scathing in his takedown of the creationists with the following choice words punctuated equilibrium provides an even easier target for this form of intellectual dishonesty or crass stupidity if a charge of dishonesty grants them too much acumen no one should be surprised that our views have become grist for their mills and skills of distortion iam not an evolutionary biologist but as i said in the introduction one of the skills i possess is the ability to read i know that the famous biologists and philosophers of biology like richard dawkins and daniel dennett belittle punctuated equilibrium and claim that it s barely a wrinkle on darwin s theory maybe the issue for me is not whether gould and eldredge proposed something revolutionary but whether what they offered was anew way to look at evolution and whether it stands up to empirical analysis a search of punctuated equilibrium on google scholar which searches only for scientific articles throws up more than 85 000 results not all may be relevant but a glance through the first few pages of these results clearly shows that scientists have gathered enough evidence for this phenomenon over the years to a layperson like me it seems that the theory of punctuated equilibrium did move darwin s theory forward as the re search articles described in this chapter demonstrate when i first read about the theory many years ago my first thought was that life was all about not just biological life but life no wonder a two hour movie can capture or seem to capture the entire life of mahatma gandhi frida kahlo muhammad ali or coco chanel moviemakers use punctuated equilibria to eliminate the stasis from the lives of heroes and celebrities highlighting only the punctuations history books apply the same technique to chronicle the life of an entire civilization over thousands of years by compressing narratives into a few hundred pages on my desk lies a copy of duff mcdonald s book the firm the story of mckinsey and its secret influence on american business which compresses almost a century of the consulting firm s existence into a mere four hundred pages now that i have seen the theory i can no longer unsee it it seems to apply everywhere i look but let me not get carried away let s return to investing here are my main investing lessons from the theory of punctuated equilibrium 1 business stasis is the default so why be active 2 stock price fluctuation is not business punctuation 3 take advantage of the rare stock price punctuations to create a new species business stasis is the default so why be active in the business world as in the organic world stasis is the default great businesses stay great bad businesses remain bad yes yes i know off the top of your head you can name an incredible business in deep trouble so can i softbank and a lousy business that has revived from the dead so can i softbank this assertion about business stasis is not about starting a battle of anecdotes my contention is not that counterexamples don t exist but that we should be more concerned about dominant relative frequency an apt term i learned from gould s magnum opus the structure of evolutionary theory he argues that punctuated equi librium does not merely assert the existence of a phenomenon but ventures a stronger claim for a dominant role as a macroevolu tionary pattern in geological time similarly my three decade long journey in the corporate world has led me to believe that great businesses stay great and that more often than not bad businesses stay bad allow me to clarify the meaning of some words stasis does not mean static a corner store in your neighborhood selling the same products since you were a toddler is static the corner store hasn t changed dollar general a variety store chain that sells deeply discounted products across more than 16 000 stores and grew its revenue two anda half times between 2011 and 2021 to 33 billion is in stasis the character of dollar general hasn t changed iam excluding industries in which greatness and badness haven t had time to settle these include areas like ai space travel autonomous vehicles food delivery wework clones quantum computing nanotechnology and other sectors into which substantial venture capital investments are pouring i wish i could apply deductive reasoning all humans are mortal socrates is a human therefore socrates is mortal to prove without doubt that the great and not so great businesses stay in stasis over long periods but unfortunately i cannot find such a route so as usual let me take the inductive path by presenting you with multiple strands of evidence ihave divided this section into four parts each of which separately asserts that great businesses remain outstanding and that inadequate businesses continue to underperform of course none of these sections makes an infallible argument hey this is investing not linear algebra but taken together i hope to make a convincing case for the third leg of our investment philosophy don t be lazy be very lazy part i proof from personal experience don t you detest arguments that take refuge in personal anecdotes we homo sapiens can reason rationalize almost anything we have spotted ufos witnessed election fraud not worn masks during the covid 19 crisis and believed that baseball is some how superior to cricket however in this case in which i need to show that stasis is the default for businesses i ask that you give me some leeway for two reasons first i have been in the business world for almost thirty five years and at some point anecdotes can transform into patterns second this belief is not the result of armchair philosophizing but the very foundation of how we manage money for our clients and for ourselves almost all my wealth is in my fund not believing in the right way to manage money will cost me serious money my first job was as a production management trainee at unilever in india in 1989 unilever had and i believe continues to have an exceptional training program for its new managers during my first year i circulated through all the critical departments of brooke bond a unilever subsidiary that manufactured and sold tea and coffee i remember my four week stint at the sales office in the city of coimbatore in south india every day i went to the market with the sales officer who should have been called the no sales officer on paper his job was to sell tea but in reality the dominance of brooke bond s brands compelled him to ration the orders to the various retailers clamoring for more tea the respect and awe he commanded would have shamed many local politi cal leaders unilever has maintained its preeminent position in tea and dozens of other consumer products in india over many decades it was exceptional in 1989 and it is exceptional today for example unilever s subsidiary listed in india hindustan unilever has a market value of almost half that of its parent listed in the united kingdom the same phenomenon has been confirmed across many other product and service categories in india over more than two decades toothpaste colgate chocolate nestlé cars maruti suzuki innerwear page consumer electricals havells biscuits parle britannia hair oil marico paint asian paints berger tires mrf diagnostic services dr lal it outsourcing tcs infosys kitchen appliances and cookware hawkins ttk prestige herbal supplements dabur and many more whichever country you are in i bet you may have noticed the same phenomenon in many industries most of the leading players of the 1990s or early 2000s are the leaders today the new age internet businesses have taken this continued dominance to a level unseen in almost any other era whether amazon facebook google twitter or uber stasis is the default since great businesses remain great for an eternity everyone knows about them investors bid their prices up and rightly so the ten year average price earnings pe multiples of some of the leading consumer businesses in india are astronomical for ex ample asian paints 56 colgate india 43 dabur 44 hindustan unilever 51 and page industries 65 as price sensitive investors we should not buy these businesses since their valuations would almost always be too high for us and we don t from the list provided two paragraphs earlier the only companies we have been able to buy since 2007 are page havells and ttk prestige our window of opportunity for buying these three was only two to three months over almost fifteen years a punctuation event that lasted just 1 to 2 percent of this period there are very few great businesses and they are almost always unbuyable hence we buy very rarely and when we do we buy a lot so having purchased these winners given the stasis of their success why should we sell part ii the fate of the fortune 500 i want to revisit the comparison of the fortune 500 lists from 1955 and 2015 detailed in chapter 8 we saw that a plausible case could be made for 40 to 45 percent of the fortune 500 businesses of 1955 maintaining their excellence for sixty years of course this is not perfect stasis nor is organic life in pure stasis as we saw earlier in this chapter but it sure is a pretty good case of long term stasis thus if we were an owner in a collection of these excellent businesses and i know that is a very big if it would have made no sense to sell and leave as a portfolio not necessarily individually the businesses in this group should have done well for us with a reasonable degree of confidence we can state that at least 40 to 45 percent of the largest five hundred u s businesses in 1955 performed exceptionally well over sixty years stasis was the default for this group of companies here is another way to look at stasis let s shine a light on the businesses that did not make it we saw that at least 40 percent of businesses about two hundred from the 1955 list maintained their excellence for sixty years until 2015 how many firms both private and public in 1955 could have made it on to the fortune 500 list in 2015 but did not would ten thousand be a fair estimate that is probably a highly conservative guess because businesses would have had sixty years to make it onto the list and we are not counting the thousands of businesses created after 1955 that could have made it to the list in 2015 anyway let s stick to ten thousand of these ten thousand in 1955 that could have made it to the 2015 fortune 500 list only three hundred did the remaining two hundred had stayed on the list for sixty years an apparent 3 percent success rate the actual number is probably closer to 1 to 2 percent or even lower thus 97 to 99 percent of the not so great businesses could not succeed over sixty years stasis is the default i know i have been unfair here to count listing among the fortune 500 as a measure of success is undoubtedly an unrea sonable demand many of the ten thousand businesses of 1955 may have achieved great success without necessarily becoming too large they may have focused much more on profits or may have been merged or acquired creating massive value for share holders my intention here was to demonstrate directionally that great businesses remain great much longer than we think the probability that a not so great business becomes excellent over time is infinitesimal our investment strategy is thus quite simple 1 since the vast majority of businesses do not become great our default strategy is not to buy we are lazy buyers 2 we buy only if we can find a high quality business that can stay in stasis over decades if we believe we have such a business we don t sell we are very lazy sellers part iii a conclusion from climbing concentration in an article from the july 2019 issue of review of finance grullon larkin and michaely ask are u s industries becoming more concentrated 3 it turns out to be a rhetorical question of course they are the authors demonstrate this with copious data their article shows two trends occurring from 1997 to 2014 that seem to reinforce each other 1 since the 1990s in over three quar ters of u s industries the market share of the leading players has increased and 2 these companies show higher profit margins and provide higher returns to shareholders which in turn allows them to increase their market power even more while the article does not state so explicitly it is also evident that the market power of smaller and less powerful businesses has declined over this period the authors show that not only did the revenue share of the four largest public and private compa nies in almost every industry increase but also that the average size of the leading companies also tripled in real terms during the period of measurement and this is not a recent phenomenon it turns out that the specter of increasing market power among the more extensive and more successful businesses has haunted the corporate world since the beginning of the twentieth century in 1977 leslie hannah andj a kay published concentration in modern industry theory measurement and the u k experience hannah and kay demonstrate the inexorable rise of the biggest firms market share in the united states and the united kingdom from the early 1900s to the mid 1970s the first graph in the book tracks the share of the largest hundred firms in manufacturing net output during this period over seventy years the market share of these firms rose from 15 percent to 50 percent in the united kingdom and from 20 percent to more than 30 percent in the united states hannah and kay claimed increasing market power which cuts across industries and not increasing industry concentration which measures the increasing power of companies within an in dustry ideally i would like to demonstrate greater industry concentration to make my case but it is still instructive to note the longer term success of the largest firms in the united states and the united kingdom ajanuary 2019 oecd working paper titled industry concentration in europe and north america presents evidence for the increasing power of more successful firms quite emphatically 14 between 2001 and 2012 the largest 10 percent of companies in the average industry in ten european countries increased their market share by 2 to 3 percentage points in the united states the increase in market share of the leading firms of the average industry between 2000 and 2014 was 4 to 8 percentage points the paper also clarifies that the numbers were not driven by digital intensive sectors e g search engines social media e commerce but by old world manufacturing and services firms in march 2016 the economist magazine s cover bemoaned winners take all why high profits are a problem for amer ica 15 of course i am not qualified to pass judgment on the appropriateness of the sky high profits of giant corporations but ido want to quote the magazine s view on the stasis of businesses the article discusses three key reasons technology globalization and decline in trade union membership for profit accu mulation among the more successful firms and then follows with the following none of these accounts though explain the most troubling aspect of america s profit problem its persistence it mentions that a highly profitable firm in 2003 had an 83 percent chance of being very profitable in 2013 a powerful visual plot of the share of the top four companies in 893 industry sectors from 1997 to 2012 clearly shows the increasing power of larger businesses the summary of all this research on industry and market concentration is as follows 1 there are a few large and successful firms in most industries 2 these successful companies are becoming even more successful 3 weak companies are getting weaker numbers 1 and 2 are direct conclusions of the research and number 3 is an indirect but logical outcome of 1 and 2 as i wrote earlier our investing experience in india is not different from what research from the united states the united kingdom or europe says our investee companies have been gaining share over the competition over decades some examples are berger in the paint industry supreme in plastic pipes voltamp in industrial transformers page in innerwear havells and v guard in consumer electricals amara raja in batteries info edge in job boards mrf in tires and ratnamani in specialty steel pipes in india too great businesses continue to be great and poor businesses continue to suffer the observation that stasis is the default does not respect national boundaries as permanent owners we want to own successful businesses that will maintain their rewarding run that sounds straight forward but the problem is that there are very few successful businesses throwing a dart at the business landscape will land us in real trouble so we don t we invest rarely we should not sell once we own a winner like havells or ratnamani since it will likely keep gaining market share so we don t we sell even more rarely than we buy part iv the narrative of a ninety year study in may 2018 hendrik bessembinder of the w p carey school of business at arizona state university published an article titled do stocks outperform treasury bills s he analyzed the price performance of about 26 000 common stocks listed on the new york stock exchange the american stock exchange and the nasdaq from 1926 to 2016 unsurprisingly 51 percent of these stocks lost their entire value over their lifetime the majority of businesses should not be in business bessembinder s research demonstrates that since the average common stock will lose its value over time owning stocks can harm one s wealth our default position should be not to buy so we don t we are lazy can you guess the number of those 26 000 stocks if purchased in 1926 and held until 2016 or acquired or merged that beat the market the answer is about 8 000 or about 31 percent of the universe 2 again i was surprised at how high this number was remember that we are talking about the companies not just doing well but beating the market over 90 years or until they were merged or acquired these great businesses maintained their greatness over a very long period stasis was the default for them once we own such a business selling would border on being sinful stock price fluctuation is not business punctuation acritical element of the theory of punctuated equilibrium is that fluctuation is not punctuation during long periods of stasis the character traits of living organisms do vary but within limits acritical element of our investment philosophy is that we do not confuse stock price fluctuation with business punctuation during long periods of business stasis stock prices vary but the character of excellent businesses tends to stay within limits as gould clarifies stasis does not imply absolute stability but rather directionless fluctuation that generally does not stray beyond the boundaries of geographic variation within similar species and particularly does not trend in any given direction espe cially towards the modal morphology of descendant forms the character traits of species do fluctuate while they are in stasis but they are range bound there is a tendency among investors to interpret stock price movement as the measure of business direction shouldn t it be the other way around does the cart drive the horse you bet it does more often than you can imagine and it does strange things to even the best of us our community can and does accord a level of priority to ticker symbols that they don t deserve here is a true story a venture capitalist vc friend and i were meeting for lunch one afternoon in mumbai as you may know vcs invest in start ups and early stage privately held businesses every few minutes he would glance at his phone and then return to our conversation i had known him for more than a decade but had never witnessed this odd behavior before after a few minutes i became mildly irritated and asked him the reason for his distraction he apologized and sheepishly remarked that two of his portfolio companies had gone public in the past two weeks after that he said he felt compelled to check their stock prices every few minutes he admitted that he couldn t help himself my friend is an intelligent guy he knows that the business of his listed portfolio companies is not changing by the minute a few weeks earlier when the companies were unlisted he hardly ever thought about them but now that they each had a stock exchange ticker that gyrated a few percentage points every day he had gotten caught up in the action now imagine if he were running a public market fund like ours in which every portfolio company is listed that may have driven him up the wall which is what happens to many in our community a great example of stock prices getting the upper hand is provided by amazon the company had its ipo in may 1997 at 18 by december 1998 when dot com mania was sweeping through the u s markets the stock had climbed almost fourteen times to 243 the star analyst at cibc oppenheimer henry blodget published a price target of 400 within twelve months 12 the stock promptly jumped almost 20 percent to 289 in one day in january 1999 blodget wrote unlike with other famous bubbles the internet bubble is riding on rock solid fundamentals perhaps stronger than any the market has seen before well where was the evidence none of the rising dot com stars was even close to earning any profit worse they were burning cash as if the market faucet would remain open forever the only empirical evidence backing blodget s claim of solid business fundamentals seemed to be that the stock prices were rising by the time the dot com bubble burst in the summer of 2000 amazon had dropped more than 60 percent from its peak ravi suria a young lehman bond analyst issued a withering twenty seven page report predicting that amazon was doomed and that if the company did not change its ways it would be out of cash within a year 2 in this highly bearish environment for all dot coms amazon fell 19 percent in a single day bezos brushed the criticism aside and amazon kept doing its business the way it had always done by caring more about cash flow than profits suria had predicted that amazon would be left with 125 million in the bank at the end of 2001 instead amazon ended the year with 1 billion amazon s bonds which suria had predicted would col lapse were up 50 percent just as blodget had gained stardom by predicting that amazon would keep rising suria became the darling of financial pundits with his prediction that amazon would fail the only difference blodget was cheerleading when all stocks were rising and suria predicted doomsday in the middle of a catastrophic bear market it is unfair to pick on only blodget and suria they were two among thousands of analysts and investors who got carried away by the rising and falling stock prices of the dot com era the saga repeated itself during the global financial crisis of 2008 when the rising market capitalizations of highly leveraged lenders blinded most financial experts to the deepening malaise that finally brought the global economy to its knees in my opinion investors can commit two types of grave errors first they can treat an unfavorable stock price fluctuation as a negative business punctuation this mindset compels the investor either to sell a good business or not to buy a good business when the price declines owing to a negative piece of news or event i covered this first error in the previous chapter when discussing the grant kurtén principle of investing gkpi as a re minder gkpi says the following when we find high quality businesses that do not fundamentally alter their character over the long term we should exploit the inevitable short term fluctuations in their businesses for buying and not selling since chapter 8 addressed this issue let me not dwell any more on it here the second error is to regard a positive stock price fluctuation as positive business punctuation doing so can lead to buying a lousy business because it seems that things have permanently improved or not selling one ask any long term investor about their investment strategy and almost all will proclaim that they buy and hold high quality businesses i doubt even one would admit to buying poor quality businesses to trade later at a higher price they are not lying then why is the portfolio of many funds filled with the latest chamath spac who knows fomo envy greed and some other quality human attributes probably play a role it doesn t matter these investors changed their minds about the quality of a business based on some positive evalua tion of the opportunity we see the same news flow as everyone else we often see industry brethren rake in moolah by investing in airlines real estate infrastructure education public sector banks i e government owned banks or some other hyped up indian industry that does not live up to its expectations how have we avoided succumbing to the temptation of investing in a bad business on a stock market or even a private mar ket upswing by following three simple rules no sweets in the fridge my wife has a sweet tooth but is also very health conscious over more than two decades she has followed a simple yet powerful way of avoiding the enticement of desserts our fridge just doesn t have any in my view the best way to avoid investing in bad businesses is to ignore them and their stock prices we never discuss what we consider bad companies or industries in our team meetings never it doesn t matter if an airline has declared spectacular re sults recently or if every analyst recommends buying airline shares we are indifferent to a public sector bank that has hired anew ceo from the private sector and has pushed its stock price to an all time high we ignore an infrastructure business that has been awarded a new multibillion dollar contract and a gold loan business that has announced 30 percent roe in its latest quarterly result and is touted by the bulls to be the next billion dollar opportunity no one on our team is allowed to utter the famous last words of many investors this time it s different if we never discuss a business how will we ever buy it no sweets in the fridge no snacking possible the origin of every lousy investment is a good story table 9 1 shows many examples of indian industries that became news worthy after rising stock prices or soaring private

infrastructure anyone who has been to india knows that the country needs quality roads power ports airports and water while the national highways in india are now better than highways in the united states that s not saying much in the mid to late 2000s many investors salivated at the billions or was it trillions of dollars that were waiting to be made by investing in indian infrastructure the valuations of private and public companies were soaring and there seemed to be a consensus that the gold rush was beginning amid this infrastructure mania reliance power launched an ipo in january 2008 that was oversub scribed seventy two times it made the company s owner anil ambani the richest indian despite having a power capacity of less than 1 000 megawatts at the time of the ipo the company s value was about 35 billion did this lead to a large number of ipos for infrastructure businesses that investors lapped up hungrily does the sun rise in the east both private and public equity investors in the hyped up story of indian infrastructure forgot or chose to ignore some uncomfortable truths every infrastructure business is held hostage to the whims and fancies of the government the government hates to be a paying customer underpayment and late payment are the rule not the exception and even if the government behaves well the returns on these projects are capped ac cording to law so why would we want to spend a single minute debating if any power business is worth investing in we did not discuss a single story listed in table 9 1 in our team meetings we ignore the stock prices and businesses of busi nesses we detest by the way that doesn t mean that we are right to do so some investors may possess the skill to trade in and out of low quality businesses and that s fine they have my admiration and best wishes the market value of reliance power at the end of 2021 was 600 million down 95 percent from its peak business knowledge not stock price data as i discussed earlier we ignore many conspicuously poor quality industries like power infrastructure and airlines but most industries and businesses don t fall neatly into this category so what do we do when we see increasing valuation in businesses or industries that we haven t encountered before we ignore the hype around valuation and focus exclusively on business quality i have devoted the whole of section ii to this topic so let me confine this discussion to an example table 9 1 includes the news item the education sector will grow at 7 5 to 144 billion by 2020 this headline is from late 2017 when many new age education companies appropriately christened edtech in india had started getting funded at unheard of valuations in the private market we don t know ofa single listed education business in india that has made money over the long term however many have had soaring stock prices over the years with the unfulfilled promise of untold riches that would accrue to an intrepid investor one did appear to break the mold but sadly and predictably turned out to be a fraud when i assess the finances of listed education businesses in a large market like the united states i find that most don t earn even their cost of capital for example in 2021 the u s education company with the most considerable market value was grand canyon education whose market capitalization was only about 4 billion it s a dangerous place to be so what should we think about the dozens of indian edtech unicorns or soon to be unicorns i just do not have enough information to know at their current rate of blowing cash that would put usain bolt to shame they will probably not enter our radar until 2032 because they would need to have demonstrated at least a five year history of being highly profitable for us their soaring valuation is not an indicator that they are great businesses but that they have mastered the art of raising capital until the business numbers e g roce and free cash flow not revenue growth become attractive we refuse to engage with companies and edtechs are no exception do we want to own this forever our best protection against getting swayed by a false positive a stock price fluctuation that makes a lousy business look better than it is is the question we pose for every investment do we want to be permanent owners of this business are we absolutely sure that we are willing to live with it permanently are we willing never to sell it we presume guilt until innocence is proven our starting hypothesis with every business is that we don t want to own it as you have seen throughout this book a business needs to jump through several hoops before we choose to be permanent owners in it one of india s largest real estate companies launched a 2 billion ipo in july 2007 its stock price shot up by 70 percent before the end of the year news anchors screamed until they were hoarse about the unlimited potential of indian real estate a journalist friend told me that it was easier to get an appointment with a bollywood star than a real estate entrepreneur we launched nalanda in june 2007 smack in the middle of this frenzy we did not make a single real estate investment be cause we did not want to be permanent owners in a real estate business the reasons were many but let me just state the first one so i don t even have to go on to the second real estate businesses in india aren t known for gandhian governance to put it mildly what about that company today the stock price is down 75 percent from its peak given its bloated balance sheet the company has also had to raise multiple equity funding rounds in the past few years diluting existing shareholders the suffering for the owners of this business seems endless we have saved a lot of heartburn by studying business quality while ignoring stock prices we have stayed focused on getting married and have eschewed casual hookups to draw an analogy from the dating world a world intent on swiping left and right at breakneck speed probably finds it very hard to notice a marriageable candidate even when that candidate has been staring at them for decades that gives us a competitive advantage we never asked for and probably didn t deserve but we will take it thank you very much take advantage of the rare stock price punctuations to create a new species eldredge and gould s bold claim was not just that organisms changed their morphology during punctuation events but also that these events created a new species as they elaborate the theory of punctuated equilibrium attempts to explain the macroevolu tionary role of species and speciation as expressed in geological time they disagreed with darwin s claim of speciation through gradual change biologists call this process anagenesis instead they focused the minds of paleontologists and evolutionary bi ologists on the punctuation events that gave birth to novel species suppose you agree with the premise that markets are usually quite efficient and that it is very hard to buy high quality busi nesses at an attractive valuation in that case it should be evident that long term investors like us must take advantage of stock price punctuation events to create a new and improved portfolio let s return to the question i asked at the beginning of the chapter as the covid 19 pandemic created panic across the world what were we at nalanda to do in these unprecedented times we bought a lot since our inception in 2007 we have bought only at times of adverse stock price punctuations in other words we have bought only when a stock is being abandoned by investors owing to an adverse macro event industry troubles or pessimism regarding a company s prospects on three occasions the global financial crisis the euro crisis and the covid 19 pandemic all three combined to offer us an unprecedented buying opportunity talk is cheap so let me share some actual numbers table 9 2 presents the three main occasions over fourteen years from june 2007 until june 2021 when we took advantage of stock price punctuations to dramatically alter the character of our portfo lio table 9 2 punctuation events have helped us create new species period market decline amount invested jan 2008 mar 2009 73 182 million apr 2011 dec 2011 28 264 million mar 2020 may 2020 26 feb may 405 million there were 169 months from june 1 2007 until june 30 2021 we invested a total of 1 86 billion during this period however as you can see from table 9 2 the pace of investment was highly punctuated we invested 851 million or 46 percent of the total amount invested from 2007 to 2021 over only twenty six months 15 percent of the total number of months months of severely damaging market punctuations the impact of the covid 19 pandemic s negative punctuation on our buying behavior was even starker we invested 22 percent of our capital in just 2 percent of the period of our existence that is because as shown in table 9 2 we invested 405 mil lion 22 percent of our total capital invested over fourteen years in only three months from march to may 2020 which comprises 2 percent of the 169 months what i have not shown in table 9 2 is our investment pace during march 2020 we invested 16 percent of our capital in 0 5 percent of working days as the indian midcap index declined 28 percent during march 2020 we invested 288 million 16 per cent of the total amount invested until june 2021 over just seventeen days 0 5 percent of about 3 500 working days over fourteen years this amount 288 million invested in march 2020 exceeds the amount invested in twelve of the fourteen calendar years since our inception the only two calendar years during which we invested more than 288 million are 2011 320 million and 2020 486 million call us what you want but scared we aren t i guess we can all agree that we would make a sloth envious with our rare bouts of activity so what do we do the rest of the time we wait occasionally we have had to wait many years for example we invested only 34 million and 66 million in 2018 and 2019 respectively the amount we invested in 2020 turned out to be 45 percent more than in the previous five years combined but i could have done a much better job you may have noticed that we did invest a fair bit 182 million as the market panic started gathering around the global financial crisis but we could have and should have invested a lot more my excuse is that i had just started the fund in june 2007 and had not done enough work on enough companies to take advantage of the panic the occam s razor explanation is that i was a moron don t use the past tense my wife reminds me dutifully table 9 2 shows the data on the overall market levels during three punctuation events but we don t buy the market we are interested only in quality businesses hence it would be nice to find out the extent of the negative punctuation in the companies we bought we had been tracking many businesses for years and we were well prepared when the pandemic panic struck in march 2020 during march 2020 we bought eight businesses and continued to buy them until may 2020 our previous monthly record was in october 2008 when we bought six companies lehman had collapsed only a few weeks earlier on september 15 2008 and we had started gorging on quality enterprises so yes we waited almost twelve years before getting hyperactive and you thought the comparison to a sloth was an exaggeration table 9 3 lists the eight businesses we bought between march and may 2020 four mrf sundaram thermax and thy rocare

triveni 151 jul 2017 87 42 wwns 73 4 feb 2020 46 1 37 just as it does in nature this rare punctuation event dramatically altered the nature of our portfolio we were able to buy companies at prices and in quantities we never thought possible for example in table 9 3 check out the discount at which we bought wns a business we have known well since it is in our portfolio since 2008 in february 2020 it was trading at almost 74 per share within a few weeks by march 2020 the pandemic scare had crushed the stock allowing us to deploy almost 100 million at only 46 per share similarly we bought thermax a business we had been tracking for more than a decade at a 45 per cent discount to its previous high in early 2018 remember that in march 2020 there was no discussion of vaccines the world was reeling under a pandemic that no one had ever seen before and it was impossible to predict how things would turn out the world was shell shocked and rightly so during this period of hyperactivity from march to may 2020 we were often asked why aren t you waiting for things to get worse before buying my answer was we can t we have a straightforward rule that is also easy to implement buy when the price is right unfortunately not everyone follows this rule as implied by the question a widely practiced rule is to buy when the time is right that is also a straightforward rule but is it easy to implement we follow the former because we know the price we want to pay for the business we want to own it may or may not be the right price but we know it for sure we have no way of figuring out the right time maybe some folks do good for them there is another way to answer this question long term investors including us always claim that we are buying busi nesses not stock prices because this is what buffett has been saying for decades as a philosophical outlook this is generally deemed a sensible strategy but what does that statement mean for us it means the following let s say we have valued a business at 100 per share if the stock price falls to 100 and our business assessment remains unchanged we buy as much of the business as we can at or below 100 we then tell ourselves that this is a private business that we will own forever and while it happens to be listed the stock prices quoted by the ever fluctuating markets are irrelevant to us as a result we don t care if the business quotes at 50 or 75 or 500 we are public market investors but we behave as if we are investing in private businesses for all practical purposes an afterthought there is almost no business in our portfolio that we could buy at an absolute bottom including the ones listed in table 9 3 if you are searching for an abysmal market timer look no further our 2008 09 and 2011 investments have primarily turned out well i don t know if our aggression in 2020 will yield fruit but iam happy about our process which was in our control the outcome will be what it will be we will know in eight to ten years if we were foolish or intelligent don t you love long term investing 2k a housefly lives for a month a mosquito for one to three months and a cockroach for up to six months unfortunately most insects live only for a brief period there is one notable exception though three species of periodical cicadas found in the united states can live for up to seventeen years after hatching baby cicadas called nymphs spend seventeen years underground feeding on the roots of plants and trees after that time the adults emerge together in billions some say even trillions beginning in the second week of may get into a mating frenzy lay their eggs on trees and are dead by the end of june the eggs hatch in about six weeks the nymphs drop down from the trees and burrow underground and the seventeen year cycle begins again this evolutionary strategy called prey sa tiation has been supremely successful for eons because no predator can consume such a large number of cicadas in just a few weeks 22 there are currently twelve groups called broods of seventeen year cicadas in may and june 2021 enormous broods called brood x meaning ten emerged mainly in pennsylvania virginia indiana and tennessee we will see them next in 2038 our patience for a punctuation event seems pedestrian compared to the remarkable restraint of the cicadas they wait sev enteen years for a life changing event we have had at least three during just fourteen years when will we witness the next one i have no idea but i know this as a species we investors are nowhere as disciplined as the cicadas our community will take things to an extreme before all hell breaks loose again we are waiting chapter summary evolutionary theory has taught me that reimagining investing requires us to accept the pervasiveness of business stasis in other words great businesses generally re main great and bad businesses generally remain bad 1 the theory of punctuated equilibrium contends that evolutionary change occurs quite suddenly after long periods of stasis not through a gradual process as claimed by darwin stasis is the default in the natural world except when punctuations arise to create a new species 2 stasis is the default in the business world too great businesses generally stay great and bad businesses generally remain bad this is evident not only from my personal experience of investing in india over a few decades but also from empirical data from the united states on the longevity of high quality businesses 3 not all fluctuations in the long term evolution of an organism are punctuations over a period of stasis organisms do vary within limits 4 we do not confuse stock price fluctuations with business punctuations this has allowed us to be aggressive buyers three times in our history including during the market panic of the covid 19 pandemic 5 we avoid investing in bad businesses when their stock prices are on an upswing by focusing on the bad quality of the busi ness and asking ourselves if we want to own it forever chapter 10 where are the rabbits one of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we see in them adaptation not indeed to the animal s or plant s own good but to man s use of fancy the key is man s power of accumulative selection nature gives successive variations man adds them up in certain directions useful to him in this sense he may be said to make useful breeds charles darwin on the origin of species chapter 1 variation under domestication despite the enthusiasm for activity that has swept business and financial america we will stick with our til death do us part policy it s the only one with which charlie and i are comfortable it produces decent results and it lets our managers and those of our investees run their businesses free of distractions warren buffett annual letter to shareholders 1986 n october 1988 forbes published a list of the four hundred wealthiest americans sam walton was the richest with a fortune of 6 7 billion and buffett was ranked tenth with 2 2 billion the list was full of familiar names including gates helmsley hillman kluge mars newhouse packard perot pritzker and redstone but who was shelby cullom davis almost no one had heard of him and how was he ranked as high as 197 while being a new entrant davis was tucked between the famous names of joseph albertson the founder of the albertsons stores and fritz otto haas the founder of the global multinational chemical company rohm and haas but what had he founded forbes men tioned that he was worth 370 million was from tarrytown new york and had created his wealth from investment banking however forbes was not entirely correct shelby davis was not an investment banker unlike everyone else on the list he was not an entrepreneur and did not own a business he was an investor like buffett but the similarity appeared to stop there first buffett was a professional investor managing money for others whereas davis invested his own money or his wife s second buffett started investing in his early twenties whereas davis did not start investing until he was thirty eight years old third buffett had studied finance and investing under the great benjamin graham davis had had no interest in economics or finance during his college days instead he had majored in history and had a special love for the russian revolution finally buffett had spent his entire career investing davis had had at least five careers before age forty he reported for cbs radio his first assignment was interviewing amelia earhart was a free lance writer and was a stock analyst a statistician he worked at the war production board in washington during the second world war and was a deputy superintendent in new york state s insurance department even davis s investing style was radically different from buffett s buffett invested across a range of industries whereas just one sector contributed to davis s colossal wealth buffett invested in very few businesses in the united states whereas davis in vested in at least 1 600 businesses worldwide and occasionally traded heavily but there was one way in which davis and buffett were alike and it made davis wealthier than most people who have ever lived on this planet darwin the unappreciated math wizard darwin was a mathematical genius but he didn t think so on july 29 1828 the nineteen year old charles darwin wrote a letter to his close friend and second cousin william darwin fox he started with a complaint and then rued his lack of mathematical prowess what excuse have you to offer for not having answered my letter long before this i hope it is nothing worse than idleness or what would be still better i hope it arises from your being ten fathoms deep in the mathematics and if you are god help you for so am i only with this difference i stick fast in the mud at the bottom and there i shall remain in status quo 2 darwin reiterated his weakness in mathematics in his autobiography after years i have deeply regretted that i did not pro ceed far enough at least to understand something of the great leading principles of mathematics for men thus endowed seem to have an extra sense he also admitted that the subject was repugnant to me 3 he detested complex mathematical formulations and once wrote to a friend i have no faith in anything short of actual measurement and the rule of three the rule of three is a simple mathematical calculation that answers the problem if ten mangoes cost 8 how many mangoes can one buy for 40 i regard darwin as a math genius because of his intuitive grasp of the prodigious power of long term compounding most of his peers didn t understand it in fact neither did many of his successors in chapter 3 of origin struggle for existence darwin s exquisite grasp of the power of compounding is evident in his famous example of elephants he wrote the elephant is reckoned to be the slowest breeder of all known animals and i have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of increase it will be under the mark to assume that it breeds when thirty years old and goes on breeding till ninety years old bringing forth three pair of young in this interval if this be so at the end the of fifth century there would be alive fifteen million elephants de scended from the first pair like no one else before him darwin understood that an exponential increase of populations was theoretically possible but practically almost impossible diseases predators lack of food natural disasters and many other factors kept populations in check this realization led him to conclude that only the fittest variants would survive to pass on their traits to their offspring these fitter variants would then start exponentially increasing leading to evolution through natural selection as he famously wrote in chapter 4 of origin this preservation of favorable variations and the rejection of injurious variations i call natural selection as i discussed earlier darwin s theory of natural selection had no place for sudden and dramatic changes his theory required variations to be small and continuous and natural selection to work over very long periods through accumulated changes despite its glaring simplicity and explanatory power or maybe because of it his theory remained on the periphery of biological sciences during his lifetime and was not entirely accepted by the scientific community t in 1900 after the rediscovery of gregor mendel s work on heredity hugo de vries a well respected dutch botanist and geneticist proposed a new theory of evolution called mutationism according to this theory the slight continuous variation proposed by darwin could not lead to the evolution and creation of species only significant mutations could in his die mutations theorie the mutation theory de vries claimed that new species arise suddenly owing to discontinuous alteration he wrote the new species thus originates suddenly it is produced by the existing one without visible preparation and without transition s now that everyone could understand intellectually this was a much simpler assertion to understand than darwinism be cause it could be visualized darwin s gradualism couldn t be the world of investing is eerily similar everyone seems to know that the stock price of amc a movie theater chain tripled in may 2021 but how many know that home depot s multiplied 140 times over thirty years from 1990 to 2020 according to mutationism species are created not because of minor variations but because something big and strange hap pens that transforms the organism the controversial debate between mutationism and darwinism remained unresolved until the 1920s finally mathematics rescued biology who would have thought in the 1920s and 30s the theoretical geneticists r a fisher j b s haldane sewall wright and a few others explained in complex mathematical language how continuous variation was compatible with mendel s laws natural selection acting cumulatively on minor variations could produce significant evolu tionary changes over surprisingly short periods 2 these acknowledged mathematical geniuses restated what darwin had asserted almost fifty years earlier he was saying that if a particular variation say color vision could give an individual a slight advantage over its peers almost the entire population would be able to see in color over many fewer generations than we would imagine let us assume that color vision has a selective advantage of 1 percent meaning that individuals with this trait produce 101 viable offspring instead of 100 maybe color vision allows the individuals to locate higher quality fruits in the forest thus the selective advantage here is equivalent to compound interest or annualized return the advantage accumulates and grows exponentially over generations thus in the second generation the 101 offspring with color vision produce 10 201 offspring who can see color 101 x 101 whereas the 100 normal offspring produce 10 000 normal offspring 100 x 100 this slight advantage compounded at 1 per cent per generation yields dramatic change over time suppose there are eight individuals with this trait i e color vision among a thousand individuals over how many gener ations do you think color vision would spread to 90 percent of the population only 3 000 2 thus if this were an organism with a life span of one month most of this species would have color vision within 250 years with just a 1 percent selective advantage in evolutionary terms this is almost instantaneous transformation and this is not just theory scientists observed the rapid evolution of peppered moths in manchester in britain in the nineteenth century 2 peppered moths were generally white with small black splotches on their wings they rested on lichen covered tree trunks during the day where they were camouflaged against birds their main predator the species also had a rare black colored mutant but it did not survive long because it was visible to birds against the background of tree trunks as a result most populations of peppered moths were well peppered but as manchester became industrialized from the middle of the nineteenth century air pollution blackened tree trunks thereby reversing the advantage the black mutant became invisible to birds and the peppered form stood out the first black peppered moth was recorded in manchester in 1848 and by 1895 98 percent of the population had become black the cumulative impact of a slight advantage had converted the rare form into the dominant one interestingly as britain passed strict pollution laws in the middle of the twentieth century trees began to lose their sooty coating as a result the black moth has be come rare and the peppered form is now dominant this kind of microevolution e g a change in color given enough time can lead to macroevolution i e the creation of anew species there isn t a single mathematical formula in darwin s origin still it captures the power and essence of long term com pounding better than the complex formulas of the geneticists amazingly a mathematically challenged naturalist could figure out what had eluded scientists over the millennia by apply ing a simple yet profound mathematical concept to the natural world compounding creates life all of it but why is this relevant for us investors because compounding also creates wealth almost all of it the assault on australia we think we understand compounding but we don t by we i mean the investment community myself included although nalanda s entire investing strategy rests on the pillar of slow and steady compounding over decades even iam amazed at its stun ning even surreal results when applied over long periods before we proceed any further i want you to appreciate its tremendous power then i will highlight two surprises one small and one big that cumulative growth has in store for students of evolution and investing for this section i will be an omniscient consultant are there any other kinds in the nineteenth century and you will be a savvy time traveler from 1925 who said investment stories couldn t be exciting let s now go back in time to winchelsea in australia in 1859 where i am an adviser to one mr thomas austin mr austin has imported twenty four rabbits from england and he wants to release them into the wild for sport hunting he is an intelligent fellow and is wary of the rabbits prodigious reproductive ability as he does not wish the farmland in winchelsea to be overrun by rabbits he seeks my counsel just as iam about to advise him to release the rabbits i see you swooping in from the future to issue a dire warning i come from 1925 and see a catastrophe ahead don t release the rabbits on further inquiry you reveal that the whole of australia is in peril because of these twenty four creatures i laugh at your facetious remark ignore the warning and ask mr austin to release the rabbits you promise to visit me every five to ten years to continue to warn me about exterminating the rabbits you fulfill your promise and every time you come to see me i ask the same question table 10 1 captures the history of our interactions table 10 1 the first thirty five years years after 1859 no of rabbits your advice my response 5 108 kill them before it s too late where are the rabbits 10 482 kill them before it s too late where are the rabbits 20 9 700 kill them before it s too late where are the rabbits 35 900 000 kill them before it s too late where are the rabbits thirty five years go by and i continue to gloat over the fact that you have been proven wrong there are fewer than a million rabbits in about eight million square kilometers of land area and they don t seem to pose any imminent danger but you warn me that the historical growth rate is about 35 percent a year and at this pace australia will be overtaken by rabbits in the not too dis tant future as is my custom i ignore the genie from the future table 10 2 tells the story of the next thirty one years until 1925 table 10 2 the next thirty one years years after 1859 no of rabbits your advice my response 45 17 5 million kill them before it s too late ican see some 55 350 million is it too late no it s not 66 10 billion itold you so this is a true story unfortunately the twenty four rabbits released by mr austin in australia in 1859 did produce ten billion rabbits by 1925 and wreaked havoc on the flora and fauna of the continent 12 despite more than one hundred fifty years of gov ernment efforts ranging from building fences trapping shooting and conducting biological warfare by releasing flies with the deadly myxoma virus australia has been unable to eliminate this pest i said that there were two surprises in this story the small surprise at least for me is that twenty four rabbits became ten billion at some intuitive level we investors understand that compounding can lead to astronomical numbers given enough time but even then i doubt many of us would have been able to envision a number of ten billion rabbits in the mid 1920s when there had been fewer than a million in 1895 the bigger surprise which is also counterintuitive is the opposite observation nothing happened for a very long time after twenty years not many rabbits would have been visible in australia and even after forty five years there were fewer than two rab bits per square kilometer so australians ignored the rabbit problem for many decades because rabbits did not become a problem this property of compounding that its impact seemingly remains hidden for a long time wreaks havoc on the perfor mance of investors because most sell too soon an investor can hold a great business for five years multiply their money three times and then sell off for two potential reasons first they think that they have made enough and that there are better fish in the sea second they get tired of the slow progress after all the share price of gamestop can jump seventeen fold in a month little do they realize that if the share price had continued to climb at the same rate in twenty five years they would have made 243 times their money i know that that is a big if but it isn t an insurmountable hurdle for a quality business as we will soon see also even if the incremental return from the fifth to the twenty fifth year in this example falls by more than five percentage points the investor would still make 100 times their money on the original investment as i said the bigger mystery of compounding is not that it leads to large numbers but that it doesn t do so for a long time the holding period of most funds is barely a few months let alone years if you explain this behavior to an intelligent non investor type i have done so they will find it rather odd they say something like this you are telling me that it is tough to find great companies to invest in you are also telling me that these companies can grow their profits reasonably predictably over long periods so why would you sell such a company in a hurry after you have become fortunate enough to own it i haven t had a good answer to this question except my community is not willing to wait for the rabbits ihave seen too many people make a profit of 50 to 100 percent on an investment in a great company and then press the exit button we investors take pride in being math savvy mention the word compounding to us and you will get knowing smiles unfortunately most of those knowing smiles do not seem to know that what they know about compounding that it can lead to big numbers over time hides two great unknowns the first is that compounding does not lead to significant numbers for a very long time the second is that investing would be easy if companies could compound predictably but alas they don t the real world is quite messy and the path to long term success is treacherous unpredictable and full of disappointments what is needed to become a successful investor is not intellect a commodity but patience which is not many more reasons we don t sell are we not convinced yet with the power of compounding in evolutionary theory as the background let me present some more reasons we are permanent owners in great businesses i will never sell would be an understandable sentiment from a passionate entrepreneur but it is somewhat unusual some may even say wrongheaded coming from a fund manager it needs a more elab orate explanation here we go reason 1 who are the richest the ones who never sell have you looked at the forbes list of the twenty five wealthiest people in the world in 2022 in case you are interested elon musk is the leader 219 billion and the twenty fifth ranked is zhang yiming from china 50 billion this list consists entirely of people who have never sold even if you expand the list to the richest fifty forty eight are business owners or their families who haven t sold so for example there are two money managers jim simons and stephen schwarzman on the list who may buy and sell shares as a part of their fund management business still they haven t sold their businesses renaissance and blackstone respectively which in turn has made them billions if not selling is creating such humongous wealth globally why do fund managers think they can make themselves rich by trading in and out of stocks i know that i am not smarter or better than the richest people in the world but if holding on to great businesses has worked wonderfully for them why should i not simply emulate them many entrepreneurs on this list have had attractive offers over their lifetime the reason for their being on the list is that they did not succumb to temptation they intuitively understood that they were on to something quite extraordinary and that selling would have been value destroying not value creating for example in 2005 viacom offered mark zuckerberg 75 million for facebook which would have made the twenty one year old a cool 35 million 12 within a year of viacom s offer yahoo offered 1 billion for the company zuckerberg refused both these and many other offers his net worth in 2022 more than 50 billion in one way while we may not create as much wealth as these stalwarts we are better off than them they are betting on just one business their own we have the luxury of owning many great businesses what could be better than that reason 2 empirical evidence shows that owning great businesses works oh so well let s go back to the bessembinder study i referred to in the previous chapter 12 as a reminder bessembinder analyzed the price performance of 26 000 u s listed stocks from 1926 to 2016 he also shares the raw data from 1926 to 2019 which is available at https wpcarey asu edu department finance faculty research do stocks outperform treasury bills let s look at data from 1926 to 2019 bessembinder defines wealth creation as returns earned above one month u s trea suries of the 26 000 companies about 60 percent 15 000 destroyed value this is not surprising running a business is risky and the data support this assertion but i was surprised by two facts first the quantum of wealth creation is almost eight times the dollar value of wealth destruction although wealth destroyers outnumber wealth creators by almost 40 percent about 11 000 companies created a wealth of 54 trillion and about 15 000 businesses destroyed a wealth of 7 trillion leading to a net wealth creation of 47 tril lion when businesses do well the sky s the limit my second revelation was that only a select few companies created most of the wealth even among the wealth creators table 10 3 table 10 3 wealth creation is highly concentrated in a few businesses held for longer periods no of companies wealth trillion of total years held median top 10 2 617 52 110 25 top 1 262 35 74 47 top 30 30 15 32 59 thus the top 10 percent or about 2 600 companies account for all actually 10 percent more of the total wealth created by the 26 000 businesses the top 1 percent contribute to three quarters and just thirty firms account for almost a third of total wealth created over ninety three years an even more interesting finding is shown in the last column of table 10 3 a disproportionate amount of wealth is created by businesses that have been held for longer periods that does not mean that simply holding a business for an extended period creates value it does not the value will almost certainly go to zero for an average business table 10 3 shows that if we have a great business on average it is likely to generate more incredible wealth over a more extended period but we have one prickly issue to deal with here how do we know what a great business is so that we can hold it for as long as possible i hope you did not start reading the book from this chapter i discussed this question in chapters 1 through 7 we do not invest in mediocre or low quality businesses at throw away valuations because as table 10 3 shows it would be a waste of time only a handful of companies create wealth over very long periods and by definition all need to be exceptional in stead we invest when we believe that the business is truly outstanding and if it is given the stark reality of table 10 3 why would we ever sell it i have been wrong about assessing the quality of some of our businesses since we hold all our businesses forever the contin uous compounding of earnings and value of a few businesses has taken care of all my follies you want numbers comin at you reason 3 if there is an unbeatable formula why not copy it when i was at mckinsey we addressed client problems by sharing best practices these could range from advice related to post merger integration the process of strategy formulation and organizational design to the allocation of marketing expenses of course as a consultant i had to account for the idiosyncrasies of a particular client still i discovered that discussing how the best businesses do it was a great way to nudge a client toward a better solution here is a puzzle for you to chew on i assume you will agree that all fund managers want to earn decent returns while beating the market over the long run imagine a situation in which a multibillionaire investor shares his secret of getting rich with us every year in a detailed letter his best practice is widely known and available to everyone and it hasn t changed for more than fifty years we know his advice is invaluable because he continues to amass great wealth by following his teachings over almost six decades we also know that doing what he does is not difficult to understand or even implement at least for the professionals but most choose to both laud him and ignore him that investor of course is warren buffett and his simple advice to buy exceptional businesses at a sensible price and hold them forever has made him one of the wealthiest people in the world so then why does his advice fall on deaf ears at first glance this seems somewhat bizarre investors seem to be voluntarily giving up the chance to get rich but if you think about it for a mo ment you will realize that buffett s advice is hard to fathom for the same reason that darwin s insight was not accepted for many decades we humans don t understand compounding we say we do but we don t buffett is the darwin of investing he changed the field forever and for the better but if eminent scientists in the late nine teenth and early twentieth centuries could barely comprehend the power of cumulative growth how can investors who by and large are much more intellectually challenged be expected to appreciate it but the problem is worse than you think not only do investors blithely ignore buffett their behavior over the last fifty years indicates that they firmly believe the exact opposite the holding period of stocks by mutual funds has fallen to less than a year from seven years in 1960 let s return to shelby cullom davis despite being radically different from buffett in almost every way how did he create his wealth just like buffett davis held on to a select few quality businesses for decades unlike buffett who always wanted to be an investor davis became an investor through a series of fortunate events when he got married in january 1932 the dow hit an all time low of 41 it had fallen 89 percent from its peak in 1929 his wife kathryn provided him his seed money for investing many years later davis was lucky that kathryn s father joseph wasserman had kept his money in government bonds and lost nothing in the crash after working as a reporter for cbs radio davis earned his phd along with kathryn in political science at the university of geneva where kathryn outscored him in 1934 davis was offered a job in tokyo at the english language newspaper the adver tiser just as he and kathryn were about to depart for japan an earthquake hit tokyo forcing them to cancel their trip also the advertiser offer fell through davis was now desperate for a job but he could not find any employment in journalism in the sicken ing state of the u s economy kathryn asked her brother bill to employ davis in his investment firm davis worked as a statistician in bill s firm and traveled around the country meeting companies that looked promising for investment but davis and bill did not get along and davis left the job to start writing full time he published a book called america faces the forties which explored the causes of the great depression and how the 1940s might lead to recovery it was reasonably well received and caught the eye of thomas e dewey the governor of new york and republican presidential hopeful he lost to roosevelt in 1944 and to truman in 1948 in 1938 dewey made davis his speechwriter and economic adviser after losing to roosevelt in 1944 dewey returned to his role as the governor of new york he unknowingly put davis on the path to fabulous riches by appointing him the deputy superintendent of the state s insurance department could there be a more boring sounding job but davis took it seriously he was an outspoken advocate of insurance companies diversifying from bonds to real estate mortgages and stocks contrary to popular opinion in those days davis considered bonds extremely risky neverthe less he was remarkably prescient bonds went into a thirty five year bear market from the mid 1940s the government bond sold for 101 in 1946 sold for just 17 in 1981 investors ignored insurance companies usually quoted in the minor league of stock exchanges insurers were required to file their latest financials with the state agency and davis pored over these reports becoming an expert at understanding their inner workings he discovered that a typical insurer was selling for less than its true book value just the bonds and mortgages in an insurer s portfolio could be worth far more than its market value he realized that insurance customers paid money up front and that insurers could deploy this float to buy bonds and mortgages if customer claims weren t excessive this hidden float could slowly and silently balloon over time a patient investor could wait for this hidden asset to compound until the market too recog nized it davis left his job in 1947 borrowed 50 000 from kathryn and started investing in well run and dividend paying insur ance companies selling for less than their book value he also borrowed on the margin to fund some of his purchases in a speech to the new york insurance brokers association in 1952 davis outlined his three criteria for selecting the stock of an insurer 1 the insurer had to be profitable 2 its assets bonds mortgages stocks needed to be of the highest quality and 3 its market price had to be lower than its private market value davis was a value investor in high quality insurers and he held on to them in 1992 two years before his death his top twelve holdings were worth 261 million about half his total portfolio except for fannie mae all were insurance companies and he had bought each decades ago his best investment worth 72 million was aig and his third best worth 27 million was berkshire hathaway once he bought a great business he never sold it why should we reinvent the wheel when we have spectacular successes like buffett and davis to emulate as i will discuss davis s success shows that we don t even have to be that good to succeed just patient and so we are reason 4 how else do i pay for my mistakes shelby davis bought about a hundred insurers that made up three quarters of his portfolio and about 1 500 companies globally made up the rest most of these investments turned out to be duds his other big mistake was to buy junk bonds worth about 23 million almost all turned out to be actual junk davis made all his wealth by investing in a few high quality insurers and then refusing to sell them as a result his hundreds of mistakes became irrelevant in the context of the exceptional long term compounding of his winners in his book the davis dy nasty john rothchild states this eloquently in the final analysis davis s mistakes hindered his prosperity the way a gnat flusters a buffalo nevertheless his portfolio proved once again that over a lifetime of investing a handful of high achievers ideas could support a multitude of ne er do wells ihave made many mistakes and i know i will continue to do so this is not humility but a cold hard fact waiting for a few great businesses to compound has paid for these mistakes let me share the actual numbers with you our first fund invested about inr 18 billion about 400 million using the exchange rate prevalent at the time in seventeen businesses from june 2007 to june 2011 in june 2022 given that enough time had passed we could reliably assess the share price performance of individual companies in this fund we had only one capital loss in the portfolio so that was a failure let me arbi trarily label any business or rather the market value of the business earning an annualized rupee return of less than 10 percent a failure as well six of the seventeen businesses had earned an annualized rupee return of less than 10 percent by june 2022 thus we had seven failures one loss and six with an annualized return of less than 10 percent out of seventeen businesses or a failure rate of 40 percent but the overall performance of this fund has been better than my wildest dreams so how did we get here given the under performance of seven of our businesses because we did not sell our winners let me call these seven failed businesses the sorry seven we invested inr 7 8 billion in the sorry seven let s see what happens when we hold a good business for a long time take supreme india s leading plastic products company we invested in supreme in 2010 and by june 2022 we had owned it for almost twelve years we invested inr 1 billion in supreme which was worth inr 13 9 billion in june 2022 the gain of inr 12 9 billion in supreme is 1 7 times the total amount invested in the sorry seven 12 9 7 8 1 7 but it s much better than that by june 2022 six investments had individually paid for the total amount invested in the sorry seven table 10 4 lists what i call the superb six table 10 4 long term winners pay for the losers many times over as of june 30 2022 in inr company no of years held multiple gain total investment in the sorry seven berger 13 3 32 2x 3 3 mindtree 9 6 8 2 1 7 page 13 7 82 2x 5 2 ratnamani 11 7 16 2 1 0 supreme 11 6 13 6 1 7 wns 13 10 6 3 2 it s almost ridiculous isn t it simply owning page for fourteen years compensated for seven unsuccessful investments more than five times over if the upside of holding companies for long periods is so significant why don t investors do it one critical rea son is an underappreciation of compounding which makes fund managers value irr more than the multiple instead of the other way around in finance jargon irr is the internal rate of return or the annualized rate of return if a stock doubles in four years its irr is 19 percent and if it doubles in three its irr is 26 percent for the same multiple the shorter the period the higher the irr ignor ing the beauty of compounding investors like to boast about the irr of their investment while undervaluing the benefits of the multiple if we had been fans of irr we would have sold each of the superb six listed in table 10 4 a long time ago the colossal down side of doing this is evident from the example of page in december 2012 after four years of our owning page it had delivered 65 percent irr for most investors a holding period of four years seems long enough it would not have been very intelligent to think that we could earn 65 percent irr incrementally over the next five to ten years if we were irr fans we would have exited page in december 2012 crowed about the astronomical return delivered over four years and described the return in bold in our mar keting materials actually we don t have any marketing materials but that is beside the point the multiple on page in december 2012 was 7 8x compared to 82 2 in june 2022 so the gain on investment was only inr 3 4 billion remember that the cost of investment in the sorry seven of inr 7 8 billion does not change regardless of the hold ing period of page thus if we had sold page in december 2012 we would have recouped only 44 percent 3 4 7 8 44 percent of our investment in the sorry seven the remaining 56 percent burden would have had to be carried by the remaining businesses however since we have continued to hold page our gain has climbed to inr 40 8 billion and the sorry seven have been paid for 5 2 times over by the gain of this single holding 40 8 7 8 5 2 remember the example of the rare mutant with color vision just eight in one thousand with only a 1 percent selective advantage that overwhelmed the population in three thousand generations only a handful of compounders in a portfolio grow ing a little more than the rest achieve the same result given enough time we invest only in what we think are phenomenal businesses but i also know that some may not perform and will need to be paid for hence for investors like us even thinking of selling our winners is worse than wrong it s foolish reason 5 the only way to benefit from compounding is to stay invested if we are aggressive buyers during adverse stock price movements logic dictates that we should be aggressive sellers when stock prices rise suddenly but thankfully some of the essential things in life believing our children are unique falling in love being a dedicated doctor or nurse during the covid 19 pandemic volunteering to be a soldier are not driven by logic we don t sell when stock prices rise suddenly these nonactions during market euphoria have been as important as actually more important than our acts of buying during market panics as i wrote earlier as of june 2022 out of our portfolio of twenty four businesses excluding the ones bought during the previous two years we had multiplied our money by more than ten times in inr in nine of these the largest multiple 82 was for page and the smallest 13x was for info edge in five of these nine our holding period had been more than eleven years and we had held the remaining ten baggers for more than eight years why do we not sell when stock prices rise dramatically the answer is shown in table 10 5 here i have selected two of the nine businesses whose values have multiplied by more than ten times in inr table 10 5 the prodigious power of positive punctuations june 2007 to june 2022 measure havells page holding period years 8 5 13 7 trading days 2 724 3 586 total gain 1 270 8 890 90 gainin no of days 35 58 of trading days 13 1 6 5 gain or more no of days 44 83 of trading days 1 6 23 of total gain 142 330 days of price decline no of days 1 293 1 685 of trading days 47 47 the multiples for page given in table 10 4 are slightly lower than those shown in table 10 5 the latter tracks the increase in stock price whereas the former shows the appreciation of the values of our holdings the values are marginally different because table 10 4 accounts for redemptions in the fund which force us to sell all stocks in proportion to their value the difference as you can see is very small let me explain what you see in havells as of june 2022 we had held havells for 8 5 years or 2 724 days of trading not counting holidays our gain during this period was 1 270 percent from table 10 5 the following facts stand out 90 percent of the gain of 1 270 percent came in just thirty five days those thirty five days account for only 1 3 percent of the total number of trading days during which we held havells what if we had sold havells during one or more of those very few days those thirty five days are distributed across all years for example the top three gains for the stock came on september 20 2019 january 21 2021 and june 5 2014 if excited by the sudden price rise we had sold our shares on june 5 2014 we would have missed the significant jumps on september 20 2019 and january 21 2021 as you can see the numbers for page are similar 90 percent of the total gains came in just 2 percent of trading days havells stock gained 5 percent or more on just forty four days or 1 6 percent of the total number of trading days during our holding period if we add up the gains from those days they sum to 1 800 percent or 142 percent of the total gains over 8 5 years thus the forty four days of stock price gains of 5 percent or more accounted for more than the total gain during our entire holding period of almost nine years the opportunity cost of not holding on to havells shares during those significant days would have been egregiously high check out the astronomical impact of 5 percent plus days in page they accounted for more than 300 percent of total gains it would have been impossible for us to compound our capital if we had not remained invested in page last please look at the data from the gloomy days i e days when the stock price declined i was pretty surprised to see that the negative days account for almost half the total number of trading days across all three businesses but as you can see the negative days didn t matter because we held on to the companies throughout this period do you see where i am going with this analysis if we had sold havells or our other compounders on any day when their stock prices rose significantly we would have been celebrated for raking in cash still we would have repented at leisure as the stock prices continued to rise over the long run but how did i know that the havells stock price would continue to rise i didn t because i cannot predict stock prices ican make two predictions though first if we own a high quality business the share price will most probably but not assuredly react positively over the long run second the share price will rarely make big moves and if i am not invested in the stock on those partic ular days i can bid farewell to substantial potential gains if we have done anything right we have not done anything on days when selling seems to be the most logical thing to do reason 6 1 love our entrepreneurs i love our entrepreneurs behavioral economists have a quaint name for this disease the endowment effect it is the irrational mindset that assigns a disproportionately high value to what one owns investing is supposed to be a cut and dried profession where a la mr spock fund managers dispassionately enter and exit businesses based on intellect instinct or insight unfortunately we fulfill this requirement only for entry and some exits before investing we base our decision entirely on empirical evidence as i have shown in chapters 1 through 7 but after we have invested and if a business continues to do well i become emotionally attached to it india is a tough place to do business i am sure all countries are but india is the only market i know and almost every industry is fiercely competitive in this cutthroat marketplace any entrepreneur who stays ahead of the competition by taking calculated risks while maintaining high profitability and a clean balance sheet is genuinely admirable i know that new age technology companies are in vogue and everyone in the world seems to laud them while they blow other people s money by the millions or billions where s the glory in selling a dollar for eighty cents maybe i am getting too old in sharp contrast to these cash guzzling sinkholes take the cases of ahluwalia db corp triveni turbine and voltamp four companies in our portfolio that are leaders in their field like clockwork they throw up significantly more cash than they consume every year however our investment in them has yielded subpar returns for a decade or more my fault not theirs part of the rea son for continuing to own them is that we hope the tide will turn over time as it has for many of our other businesses still an important motivation is also that i love the leaders of these businesses they are genuinely outstanding as shown by their operat ing and financial track records over many decades one of the great pleasures of our profession is that we get to know and build relationships with the likes of shobhit uppal sudhir agarwal dhruv sawhney and k s patel 1am in awe of them so why should i give up this gratification for a few dollars reason 7 not selling makes us better buyers that seems like a weird assertion how can not selling cause better buying here is how how much time do you think fund managers devote to thinking about the right sale price for their businesses if you man age money you already know the answer but if you aren t a fund manager please ask someone who is the answer will probably range from 30 to 70 percent some fund managers argue if we are not a buyer we are a seller these people are probably contem plating a sale all the time let s say we want to figure out whether we should exit ratnamani one of our portfolio companies and india s most signifi cant specialty steel business ratnamani s clients are primarily refineries and petrochemical plants both of which are cyclical in dustries hence ratnamani s revenues and profits too are cyclical we first need to decide upon a time frame over which we will calculate the incremental return it could be one year three years or five years or some other period at the end of that time frame we will need to forecast ratnamani s profits and valuation multiple pe ev ebitda or some other metric if we want to calculate a three year incremental return we will need to forecast ratnamani s revenues expenses and tax rates for the next three years this is a nontrivial exercise for a cyclical business first a hapless analyst in the organization will need to trash their weekends to collate the capital expenditure announcements of all the refineries and petrochemical plants that could be ratnamani s clients next they will need to assume a particular market share for ratnamani to forecast the company rev enue how you ask i have no idea ask the analyst finally they will conduct a similarly detailed exercise for the significant expense lines depreciation raw material employees sales and general administration and taxes to name just a few and let s not even discuss the myriad ways of projecting a valuation multiple three years from now some asset managers may not resort to such a detailed exercise they may choose to sell if the multiple or the stock price reaches a certain level but even these professionals will need to keep track of the businesses that approach the sale price and de bate whether their initial assumptions are still valid e g what if the company s main competitor is in trouble all this takes time energy and most importantly mind space we do no such analyses we buy never to sell none of our professionals spends even a minute thinking about selling unless the business makes an egregiously wrong capital allocation or if the company according to us is irreparably damaged in the last chapter in table 9 2 i showed you the three occasions the 2008 financial crisis the 2011 euro crisis the sover eign debt crisis in europe that began in 2009 led to the change or collapse of the majority of euro zone governments from march 2011 to may 2012 15 and the covid 19 pandemic when we were highly aggressive buyers given that we were inactive for many years what allowed us to buy stocks worth 288 million 16 percent of the total amount invested since our inception in 2007 in just seventeen days in march 2020 we acted decisively and disruptively because we were well prepared we are always well pre pared to buy because we have been freed of the concerns of selling just because i have time to think does not mean i will think correctly i have made buying mistakes and will continue to do so but freed from the worries of selling our buying process is highly focused and disciplined what more can i ask it does not make any sense it seems too easy isn t it buy a great business sit tight watch the moolah roll in it is and it is not over my decades of investing i have heard many objections from my fund manager friends and investors who have refused to give us money because they were uncomfortable with our permanent owner approach it does not make sense is acommon refrain after i reveal that we plan to be permanent owners let me share with you some of these objections and my responses to them objection 1 why should i hold on to 60 pe we are price sensitive we do not invest if the valuation is high a logical question then is why aren t we sellers when the valua tion is high take a concrete example of a business that went from a pe multiple of 15x to a pe multiple of 60x over five years of our holding period let s say that earnings doubled during those five years we would be sitting on a multiple of eight times our initial investment four times from multiple expansion and two times from earnings growth many investors would justify selling at this point with the following calculation let s say the business doubles its earnings over the next five years the same as over the last five years if the pe multiple stays the same we will only double our money and if it halves to 30 pe which is possible because the long term market pe is 19 to 20 we will not make any return for the next five years so shouldn t we be sellers it s a logical and fair question it is so logical and fair that most fund managers will sell and exit at this point we won t the reasons are three fold first i have found that great businesses usually surprise on the upside what if the earnings triple or quadruple in the next five years remember that we buy only phenomenal companies they stand out because they are much better than the competi tion and usually keep gaining market share and more importantly market power we saw evidence of the increasing concentra tion of leading businesses across most industries in the previous chapter second valuation multiples generally don t stay benign for great businesses as i write this walmart with a market value of 400 billion has a pe of 33 l oréal with a market value of 260 billion has a pe of 61 we are interested only in stellar businesses their valuation multiples likely stay elevated over very long periods third why should i limit my calculation to only the next five years let s say i am wrong on earnings growth and pe multiple over the next five years assume that the earnings stay flat and the valuation multiple halves i will be sitting with a loss of 50 per cent over five years so what what if the business continues to perform for a decade after five years after five years i will fail to capture the value from years five to fifteen by selling at a high multiple let me share a theoretical case and a real case to make my point let s go back to the example from the beginning of this section i buy shares of company a for 1 in the year 2000 for a pe multiple of 15 in 2005 the earnings have doubled and the pe multiple has expanded to 60 the share price is now 8 ifi sell i will make eight times my money at an annualized return of 52 percent very nice right but i choose to hold in the next five years the earnings stay flat and the valuation halves to 30 pe the stock price is 4 in 2010 so i have lost half the capital relative to 2005 i look like a fool but wait if the business does well and if the earnings quadruple over the next ten years from 2010 to 2020 this is an annualized growth of 15 percent not an aggressive assumption for a great business and if the multiple increases by 50 percent to 45 pe the stock price would be 24 in 2020 it thus has an annualized return of 17 percent over twenty years i have made twenty four times my money in twenty years which for me is a much better outcome than eight times my money in five years why because i would have made mistakes in between and as i discussed earlier in this chapter someone needs to compensate for it as shelby davis has shown us not all the businesses in our portfolio need to work from year five to year fifteen a handful will be more than sufficient now let me share an actual example from our portfolio we bought ratnamani for inr 128 per share from late 2010 to early 2011 the price did not move for the next three years and in january 2014 the stock price was inr 135 we stayed calm and con tinued to hold our shares because the company was doing fine however in january 2015 the share price jumped to inr 700 a five fold increase in just one year the earnings had expanded suddenly and so had the valuation multiple should we have sold we didn t why because the business continued to be stellar the price stayed around the same level of about inr 700 for the next two years until january 2017 before slowly moving upward in january 2021 the price was inr 1 600 if we had sold our shares for inr 700 per share in 2015 we would have missed the run up to inr 1 600 over the next six years more importantly what matters to us is our buy price of inr 128 and relative to this price inr 1 600 for a ten year hold does not seem bad at all an annualized return of 29 percent some may argue that we should have sold in january 2015 to make more than a 50 percent annualized return that makes sense but i prefer a 29 percent return over ten years a 12 5x multiple compared toa 53 percent return over four years a 5 5 multiple we continue to own ratnamani the answer to the objection why should i hold on to 60 pe is straightforward because on average over the long run great businesses have a way of making us more prosperous than we ever thought possible objection 2 my incremental return will be low from now on ihave gotten over my buying mistakes but will never forgive myself for my only selling blunder i made it because i feared that our incremental return would dissipate we invested in a company called shree cement in late 2011 for inr 1 700 per share shree is the best cement business in india and is probably one of the best in the world cement is a highly cyclical business and we bought shree when the sentiment in the cement industry seemed to have reached its nadir within a few months of our investing to our great surprise the cement cycle turned and the stock price more than doubled while i did believe that we should own businesses forever i mistakenly thought we should make an exception for highly cyclical businesses i assumed that we would play the commodity cycle by buying when the sentiment was weak and selling when the mood turned positive i knew we could not time the cycle perfectly but i thought we could do reasonably well i sold shree for about inr 3 800 per share in october 2012 because i thought our incremental return over the long run would be un derwhelming instead we made about 2 2 times our money in less than a year we returned the proceeds of 80 million to our in vestors and felt proud to have trounced the market it was the stupidest decision i have ever made the cost to the fund four hundred million dollars and counting the stock price of shree cement in june 2022 was about inr 19 009 or more than five times the selling price ten years ago it hurts badly having learned the expensive shree lesson my response to this objection is incremental over what period one day one month one year three years twenty years and why bother if it s a stellar business the rule for selling a great business is simple don t you dare objection 3 there is a better opportunity to deploy capital the holding period of stocks has kept falling over the past few decades investors aren t trading for the sake of trading i hope they sell x to buy y because they assume y is a better prospect than x shortly after that they get rid of y to buy z for the same reason there always seems to be something better out there one justification for this hamster on a wheel behavior is that it is prudent to sell a business with 50 pe to buy a business with 15 pe not for us we never indulge in sell high to buy low activity we only sell if we have lost confidence in a business and when we do we return the money to our investors the opportunity to own an outstanding business comes along very rarely and if we have won this lottery why should we kill the goose laying golden eggs yes yes i know i sold shree cement do i have to be reminded look at it differently i assume many of you own a home or know someone who does do you know of any homeowner who trades in and out of their home at frequent intervals does a homeowner check the price of their house every day every month or even every year to sell it at a high price and buy another one at a lower price if not i see no reason to treat holding shares in a busi ness differently and empirical evidence shows that this strategy does not work 1 as discussed earlier there is a strong correlation between a fund s underperformance and its portfolio turnover i don t know what causes what and frankly i don t want to know we are happy owning a great business and treating it as our home objection 4 what should i do the whole day believe it or not a friend who used to work at a hedge fund told me many years ago but that is a lazy way to make money he is a rational fellow and did not disagree that money could be made by allowing a few quality businesses to compound but he consid ered it almost immoral to make money with no hyperactivity involved it takes all kinds he has since left the hedge fund business because he got burnt out staring at his bloomberg screen twelve to fourteen hours a day while worrying about his daily p l another fund manager asked if i don t trade what should i do the whole day this person claims to have made all his money by owning a few high quality businesses but wants to stay busy during the day i wanted to say take a vacation but i didn t different strokes investing is a unique profession in which inactivity can be hugely rewarding it has been so for us we will continue to be lazy very lazy 2k mahabharata is one of two great epics of ancient india ramayana being the other one it was written over a few hundred years starting about 400 bce at about 1 8 million words it is the longest poem known to humanity and is seven times the length of the iliad and the odyssey combined the epic describes the struggle for dominance between two groups of cousins but is a treatise on moral philosophy and the psychology of human behavior there is a famous section in mahabharata called yaksha prashna the spirit or demigod yaksha poses a series of questions prashna to yudhishthir the eldest and wisest among the cousins the stakes are high because giving correct answers will revive one of yudhishthir s four brothers killed by the yaksha one of the most famous questions posed by yaksha is what is the greatest wonder in this world yudhishthir s reply is everyone sees countless people dying every day but they act and think as if they will live forever yudhishthir s insight was that we are strangely blind to a fact that is blindingly obvious for us the yaksha prashna would be what is the greatest wonder in the world of investing with due apologies to yud hishthir my answer is everyone sees immeasurable wealth being created by people who never sell but they think and act as if it is selling that creates wealth chapter summary evolutionary theory has taught me that reimagining investing requires me to be very patient and not to sell an outstanding business at almost any price 1 darwin laid the foundation of evolutionary theory by asserting that if an organism has a small advantage over its peers say the ability to run faster then given enough time this favorable trait will spread across the entire population darwin un derstood like no one else before him that compounding can create macroevolution through microevolution 2 investors proficient in mathematics think they understand compounding but the evidence suggests otherwise the hold ing period of stocks is barely a few months investors are unable or unwilling to exercise patience and typically press the exit button after meager gains or losses 3 we have internalized the lessons of long term compounding from darwin and if a business is performing well we refuse to sell it at any price 4 some of the key reasons to stay invested forever are that the richest people in the world are the ones who refuse to sell empirical evidence from a ninety year long study shows that great businesses create enormous wealth buffett has shown that the strategy of holding forever works beautifully fund managers can pay for their mistakes by allowing the good businesses to multiply and only those who stay invested can benefit from compounding 5 most investors refuse to subscribe to the philosophy of owning businesses forever this in my opinion is a big mistake 6 we have been successful not because we are better at buying but because we refuse to succumb to the temptation of selling conclusion honeybees win by repeating a simple process so can we he must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a comb so beautifully adapted to its end without enthusiastic admira tion we hear from mathematicians that bees have practically solved a recondite problem and have made their cells of the proper shape to hold the greatest amount of honey with the least possible consumption of precious wax in their construction charles darwin on the origin of species chapter 8 instinct your goal as an investor should simply be to purchase at a rational price a part interest in an easily understandable business whose earn ings are virtually certain to be materially higher five ten and twenty years from now over time you will find only a few companies that meet these standards so when you see one that qualifies you should buy a meaningful amount of stock you must also resist the tempta tion to stray from your guidelines warren buffett annual letter to shareholders 1996 e started our journey with bumblebees so it s only fair that we end with honeybees making sense of an uncertain world the field of biology particularly evolutionary biology took a giant leap forward in 1953 with one of the most significant discover ies of the twentieth century the molecular structure of dna this nobel prize winning effort of watson and crick unraveled the mystery of how genetic information is encoded and transmitted through the double helix or did it even decades after this seminal event scientists do not agree on the definition of what constitutes a gene 1 we are endowed with 22 500 genes some scientists think that less than 2 percent are helpful whereas others assert that more than 50 percent are asa result we do not know what most of our dna comprising more than six billion letters does more surprisingly even when there is agreement on the function of a particular bit of dna it is still a mystery how this dna translates into a phenotype or ob servable trait the plain truth is that despite hundreds of millions of dollars being spent every year by dedicated researchers globally we don t understand how evolution works at the molecular level 2 and this is a good no great thing it allows scientists to ask the right questions to explore the unknown further most scientific articles in biology discuss what has been discovered or proposed and what further questions or doubts should be explored unfortunately it appears that these researchers never get to a definitive answer to any question the best they do and boy do they do it well is to raise even more questions as investors we are supposed to have deep insights into our companies and industries we are required to understand the business of the companies we invest in with the implicit assumption that the individual who can comprehend a business better will become a better investor of course we are also required to answer all the questions anyone might pose on the businesses we have invested in but the problem is that if brilliant biologists are still struggling to unravel the mysteries of a lowly discrete organic molecule after seventy years of research how can we think that an entity as amorphous as a company can be analyzed by investors in seventy days or even seven hundred aconsistent pattern was present throughout all ten chapters of this book did you detect it our entire investment approach at nalanda admits to and hence compensates for our profound ignorance we avoid many categories of risks because of the wide range of possible outcomes in these situations we invest only in exceptional businesses because most businesses fail and we want to reduce uncertainty we buy at an attractive valuation because while we don t know what will go wrong we assume that something will we rarely buy and sell even more rarely because every activity may have unintended consequences we can t foresee in this complex unknowable and uncertain world we are not trying to make the best investments since we are in the dark about most things we don t know what the best investment would be instead we are simply trying to invest well these are very different ways of investing and lead to radically different investment models our model that of investing well tries to achieve just one objective amid uncertainty increase the predictive accuracy of our investments how have we done this by emulating honeybees she dances her way to eternal success apis mellifera the honeybee weighing one tenth of a gram has existed for thirty million years she has faced multiple ice ages thousands of environmental catastrophes an unending stream of macro and microscopic predators and the arrival of the most destructive beings in the history of the planet home sapiens the most consequential decision in the life of honeybees is the choice of their home i call it a decision because that is what it is it seems to follow a process it can take many hours or even days and every honeybee in the colony appears to have a say un like eating mating or fighting choosing a home appears to be a deliberate and thoughtful process for honeybees let me explain honeybees are highly social and live in colonies of thousands in very close proximity a beehive typically has a single queen fed and protected by worker bees all of whom happen to be sterile females a single colony typically splits into a few colonies called swarms at the end of winter each of these swarms needs to find a new home to construct beeswax combs raise worker bees and build a store of honey for the following winter hence as the bees create a new swarm their most important task is finding a suitable nesting location for their hive their home needs to have a cavity volume to accommodate enough honey to last the entire winter in addition the entrance needs to be high enough above the ground to prevent land based predators from targeting the bees the entrance should also be small to en sure secrecy and warmth so that the bees home can be protected from the elements such as extreme winds so how do honeybees select their home by dancing let s say you have decided to study how honeybees choose their nesting site here is what you will observe when the bees from the mother colony split into a swarm a few dozen scouts fly away in different directions to inspect nesting sites within a five kilometer radius when a scout encounters an attractive site she returns to the swarm and performs a waggle dance to commu nicate the site s distance direction and quality to her sisters the males are lazy bums and don t do any work their only job is to impregnate the queen the duration of the dance is proportional to the distance to the new site the angle at which the bee wag gles represents the angle of the outward run relative to the sun and the vigorousness of the waggle the number of dance circuits denotes the quality of the new site since the scouts have flown over a large area they advertise many widely separated locations to their hive mates the hon eybees in the swarm follow the lead of various scouts to check out the widely dispersed sites and return to the swarm to perform their waggle dance thus initially the scouts advertise several possible nesting sites seemingly trying to recruit their hive mates to each of the chosen sites in what appears to be a quite chaotic scene however after a few hours or days all of the bees begin to dance in favor of just one location once a consensus has been established the swarm flies to the chosen location but of course the bees don t have a leader the queen bee is just a reproduction machine and is entirely dependent on the worker bees for her food and welfare so you will rightly conclude that the choice of nesting site is accomplished through a democratic process in which all the honeybees have participated once you have observed this phenomenon here are some of the questions you will probably ask how does this democratic process of building almost 100 percent consensus work how does dancing lead to consensus over time do the bees reach the right decision is this decision making a simple or complex process let s proceed step by step as i mentioned earlier honeybees need to select a high quality dwelling place to ensure their survival but what is not apparent is that if they are given a choice of multiple high quality sites they will almost always choose the best possible site good enough is not acceptable to these discerning bees when scientists artificially create a number of good nesting sites within the flying range of honeybees they find that the bees almost always converge on the best possible site even more surprisingly the bees seldom find the best nesting site first but over time even if the bees discover the best site much later than other slightly infe rior sites consensus is ultimately built around the best site researchers have conclusively proven that honeybees have an absolute standard for assessing the quality of a nesting site the vigorousness of their waggle dance translated into the number of dance circuits indicates the quality of a particular site a honeybee takes between fifteen minutes and an hour to evaluate a potential site she inspects the cavity s outside and spends a lot of time inside walking around and taking short flights if the bee finds the nesting site desirable on first inspection she returns to the swarm and advertises the site with a waggle dance if another bee follows her to this site she will perform almost the same waggle dance in terms of duration and intensity when she returns to the swarm honeybees have a universal standard for assess ing nest quality all honeybees have a congruent interest while choosing a nesting site their consensus is built over time so that eventually all bees support just one site and this almost always happens to be the best possible site but how initially scientists hypothesized that a honeybee scout compares her old nesting site with a new site to which other dancing scouts recruited her if she finds that the new site is of higher quality she ceases support for the old site and dances more vigorously to demonstrate support for the new site thus more dance circuits implies that the new site is better than the last one this process builds consensus over time since the bees keep comparing the various nest sites and the best site wins in the end this hypothesis made perfect sense but it has turned out to be wrong most honeybees visit just one nesting site and very few visit two or more so what s going on painstaking work by thomas seeley and others revealed the mystery behind the consensus building process it has just two elements first as we already know the bees dance more circuits for a better quality site second the bees in the swarm attach themselves randomly to a dancing honeybee to explore a new site but how do these two simple actions lead to a consensus of nearly 100 percent over the best possible site first let s look at a simplified version of what happens in the wild let s assume there are three scouts to begin with and they evaluate three possible new nesting sites a b and c of varying quality let s assume site a is the best and site c is the worst after assessing site a the first scout returns to the swarm and per forms twenty dance circuits the second scout evaluates site b and performs ten dance circuits finally the third scout performs only five dance circuits after evaluating site c let s assume there are one hundred bees in the swarm waiting for their scout sisters to return remember that they will at tach themselves randomly to any bee dancing and will then go and explore the site that this bee is excited about since the first bee contributes to 57 percent of the dance circuits 20 35 fifty seven of the one hundred bees in the swarm will attach themselves to the first bee by the same logic twenty nine bees will end up assessing site b and only fourteen will assess site c what happens when these one hundred bees return to the swarm 57 honeybees from site a perform 20 dances each 1 140 dance circuits 29 honeybees from site b perform 10 dances each 290 dance circuits 14 honeybees from site c perform 5 dances each 70 dance circuits thus site a now contributes 76 percent 1 140 1 500 of the total number of dance circuits performed by the bees com pared to 57 percent in the first round in the next round the bees attach themselves randomly to any of their dancing sisters and so 76 percent of the waiting bees will go and explore site a if this process keeps going you can see that the support for the best site a will keep increasing exponentially in the third round following the same logic support for site a will increase to 88 percent until almost all the bees are supporting only site a are you as gobsmacked as i was when i first read about this process do you see what has happened here the honeybees have an extraordinarily complex and challenging decision to make yet they make it through a very straightforward process dance harder for a better site and attach yourself randomly to a dancing sister that s it we follow a simple and repeatable process like the honeybees the investment community ties itself up in knots over finding the best investments i have seen extraordinarily complex algo rithms and multigigabyte spreadsheets to assess the value and quality of a business on the other hand we are interested only in executing a sound investment process our algorithm while nowhere near as elegant as the honeybees has only three steps 1 eliminate significant risks 2 invest only in stellar businesses at a fair price 3 own them forever the honeybee algorithm does not lead to 100 percent success and it need not some swarms are unable to find a suitable dwelling location and perish but so what it is a statistically robust process in which on average the simple nest seeking model works beautifully and the reason it is robust is that in addition to the algorithm being sound it is repeatable deviations from this simple model are neither required nor allowed a honeybee colony sticks to its nest seeking process season after season year after year millennium after millennium the failure of most investors does not lie in pursuing a wrong model but in failing to repeatedly pursue a good model it does not take a genius to theorize that investing in quality management teams running excellent businesses should lead to success over the long term but how many can translate this theory into practice day after day and year after year i believe we at nalanda have and you probably do not vehemently disagree a sound investment model while we strayed on a few occasions in the first few years selling shree cement we have primarily been able to stay on the straight and narrow obviously and sadly this does not guarantee investment success some investments haven t worked and many more will not but we will not second guess our investment process we will keep repeating it whatever the outcome we have always tried to be although we know we never will be like the honeybees 2k investors unlike biologists are rarely filled with doubts and uncertainties i am not talking about a typical television expert here who is meant to entertain not educate but about self perception and actual behavior a scientist may spend her life working on the genetics of a maize plant barbara mcclintock winner of the nobel prize in physiology or medicine 1983 deciphering the organization of the olfactory system linda buck cowinner of the nobel prize in physiology or medicine 2004 or inventing a gene editing technique jennifer doudna and emmanuelle charpentier winners of the nobel prize in chemistry 2020 and still admit that she has barely scratched the surface of what is knowable in contrast an investor at the end of a one hour group meet ing with a company he has never met before confidently declares that he has found the next p g my circle of ignorance has expanded in lockstep with my age as a young mckinsey consultant i thought i had all the answers as an older investor i have only questions i wish i had ready solutions for them but i don t so my only option is to inter nalize and implement a process that can simplify the world s complexity in a way that my intellect can t if we are surviving and outperforming the market many years from now it will not be because we know a lot instead it will be because we know that we don t chapter summary evolutionary theory has taught me that we can reimagine investing by executing a simple and repeatable investment process 1 the honeybees choice of a new nesting site is extremely consequential a suboptimal site can lead to death and seemingly complex 2 honeybees don t have a leader they make their decision through a consensus building process that is surprisingly simple this process does not lead to the best nesting site every time but on average it has served honeybees extremely well for more than thirty million years 3 the business and investing worlds are highly complex and i know that my limited intellect is incapable of fully compre hending them 4 hence we at nalanda have no interest in finding the best investment but in executing a sound investment process 5 our three step investment process is simple and repeatable a eliminate significant risks b invest only in stellar businesses at a fair price c own them forever 6 we know this process does not guarantee investment success every time but on average it has worked out quite well for us 7 we always have and always will stick to our process irrespective of individual outcomes notes introduction 1 2 20is the compensation structure of most hedge funds they charge 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of a fund s profits as

logical explanation for assessing the reliability of signals scientists have proposed other mechanisms too see searcy and nowicki the evolution of animal communication chapter 6 in summary the reliability of some classes of signals seem best explained by the handicap principle in the sense of signal costs that act differentially on different categories of signallers note the qualifier some classes of sig nals the authors describe the following four alternatives to the handicap principle 1 signals can be honest without the signaler incurring a cost if the receiver and the sender have the same interest for example alarm signals given by birds when they see a predator 2 when the benefit to the signaler as opposed to the cost varies with the attribute of the sig nal honest signals may arise for example when offspring solicit their parents for food 3 the constraints hypothesis states that a signal can be honest when bodily or other constraints force the signal to be reliable for example carotenoid pigmentation in red shouldered widowbirds see chapter 4 4 the theory of individually directed skepticism states that receivers remember the honesty or dishonesty of signals emitted from a certain signaler in the past and adjust their response to the signaler accordingly thus a habitual deceiver will become unable to generate the desired response in the receiver for example
