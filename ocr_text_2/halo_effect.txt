Delusion Seven: The Delusion of Absolute Performance

Company performance is relative, not absolute. A company can improve and fall further behind its rivals at the same time.

Delusion Eight: The Delusion of the Wrong End of the Stick

It may be true that successful companies often pursued a highly focused strategy, but that doesn’t mean highly focused strategies often lead to success.

Delusion Nine: The Delusion of Organizational Physics

Company performance doesn’t obey immutable laws of nature and can't be predicted with the accuracy of science—despite our desire for certainty and order.

been pursuing a strategy based on growth by focusing on totally new products. This strategy did not give the expected results.” So in 2004, Lego decided to “return to its core” and “focus on profitability.

Strange, because profitable growth was presumably what Lego had in mind when it went after those new opportunities in the first place.

Imagine, if we could turn the clock back to 1999, that Lego had decided to stick to plastic building blocks, nothing more. Nope, we're not interested in a tie-in to Harry Potter, which was only the most
popular children’s book of all time, whose first two movies racked up box office receipts of $1.2 billion worldwide. Next year’s headline? Probably something like this: EXECUTIVE SACKED AS LEGO
SALES FLAT. And the story line? Something like this: “Danish family firm stays too long with a mature product line and misses out on growth opportunities to more innovative rivals.” Analysts will com-
ment that Lego failed to go boldly forward. It lacked vision. It was inward looking. Its managers were timid and complacent—or maybe even arrogant.

Of course, some ventures outside the core are spectacularly successful. During the 1980s, General Electric, America’s largest industrial company long associated with light bulbs, refrigerators, air-
plane engines, and plastics, sold some of its traditional businesses—home appliances and televisions—and went in a big way into financial services—commercial finance, consumer finance, and insur-
ance. Today, these financial services bring in more than 40 percent of GE's revenues and a corresponding amount of its profits, close to $8 billion. Did GE go beyond its core? Absolutely. But nobody called
for the boss's head because GE was successful. In fact, GE was ranked at the top of Fortune magazine's 2005 survey of Global Most Admired Companies, ahead of Wal-Mart, Dell, Microsoft, and Toyota, and
was ranked second in the Financial Times's 2005 World’s Most Respected Companies survey, down one notch after six consecutive years at number one. So much for the perils of straying from the core.

In the weeks following Plougmann’s ouster, the U.K. magazine Brand Strategy looked a bit more closely into Lego's prospects. Like everyone else, it reported that Lego's problems were the result of
“focusing on new products such as licensed Star Wars and Harry Potter ranges, to the detriment of its core business.” But Brand Strategy went a step further and asked several industry experts what Lego
should do. Maybe these industry experts, who presumably know the toy industry and its major players very well, would be able to offer some incisive advice. They were asked: What should Lego do now?

Here was the view of a marketing manager at Hamley’s, London's legendary toy store:

Lego mustn't lose sight of what it's become known for-reliable, colorful construction toys. Its marketing is impressive but Lego needs to continue having the wow factor.

This was the advice from a toy and games industry analyst:

Lego has lost its way to some extent in recent years. It has diversified into a number of sectors and this hasn't worked. Lego should focus on what it does best and it’s right to focus back on toys.

‘And here was the view from another toy industry expert:

Lego has to remember its heritage; listen to customers; be innovative; focus on the key issues for long-term success; and go for evolution, not revolution,

Anice set of advice! Every one of these industry experts wants Lego to have it both ways: on the one hand to remember its heritage and focus on what it's known for, and on the other hand to be

innovative and achieve a wow factor. (Remember, pursuit of the wow factor was exactly what Lego had tried to do—and it got creamed for losing sight of its core. Guess that was the wrong wow factor!)
Nota single expert suggested that Lego make a clear choice and follow a definitive direction—they all want Lego to have the best of everything. You can bet that if Lego returned to profitability, every one
of these experts would say, See, Lego followed my advice, and if Lego continued to lose money, they could say, Lego didn’t do what I told them. And these are industry experts, who presumably understand

the toy industry better than you and I do.

In Great Britain, meanwhile, the BBC conducted an investigated and summarized its findings thus: “For many, the Toyota story is an old-fashioned tale of greed. It began with a small company whose
goal was simple: to make the best products it possibly could. But as the company grew and expanded in a complex, globalized world, profit and the bottom line took over. Perhaps it’s not such an old fash-
ioned tale after all.”

At the height of the public furor, in February 2010, Toyota's chief executive, Akio Toyoda, appeared before Congress to say he was “deeply sorry” for the accidents, and apologized to the families that
had suffered. He acknowledged that Toyota “may have grown too fast” and inadvertently compromised safety as it pursued volume. Of course, that was easy to say in retrospect. While Toyota was ex-

panding successfully, it was described as bold and visionary, able to combine quality and scale for the benefit of all. Now that there was a problem, observers were quick to infer greed.

How big was the problem at Toyota, really? One journalist calculated that driving one of the models involved in the Toyota recalls “raised the chances of dying in a crash over the next two years from
.01907 percent (that’s 19 one-thousandths of one percent, when rounded off) to .01935 percent (also 19 one-thousandths of one percent),” a change of just .00028 percent. Can such a miniscule change
be the difference between acceptable error and greed? Surely not. If Congress really wanted to get tough on road deaths, it would address drunk driving and mobile phone use, both of which cause many

more accidents than sudden unanticipated acceleration. As a storyline, however, neither of those has quite the same appeal. Greed is better.

...and at BP Deepwater Horizon

Just weeks after Mr. Toyoda testified on Capitol Hill, an explosion at BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil platform led to an immense oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, spoiling hundreds of miles of shoreline and

causing damage to wildlife as well as to the economies of several states. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid charged that—you guessed it—the greed of BP executives was to blame. He proclaime

‘Wall
Street isn’t the only place where a reckless pursuit of profits has proved destructive. [BP's] greed led to 11 horrific and unnecessary deaths. It has harmed an enormous tourism industry, threatened busi-
ness at countless fisheries and disrupted life for many along the Gulf Coast.”

The BP blowout, coming not long after the financial meltdown, spawned an Internet parlor game: Which was the bigger villain, Goldman Sachs or BP? Opinion in the blogosphere was divided. One
reply said: “Without a doubt, Goldman Sachs. They operated from a totally greedy standpoint in complete disregard for investors while BP’s greed for profits was partially responsible for the lack pre-
paredness for this disaster, they are providing a necessary resource for the country.” BP received a few votes, too. One noted: “BP through its Greed . . . has caused a catastrophic series of events... Millions
of sea creatures [have been] killed by BP’s willful and deliberate circumvention of health and safety rules in order to save a few (even if it’s millions) quid.”

How well did the charges of greed at BP hold up when investigators looked more deeply? Not so well. By November 2010, the lead investigator of the presidential panel that researched the spill said he
had found no evidence of safety shortcuts. Fred H. Bartlit Jr. disputed any suggestions that BP and its partners, Transocean and Halliburton, had cut corners to speed completion of the well. Bartlit noted:
“To date we have not seen a single instance where a human being made a conscious decision to favor dollars over safety.” As for the engineers and workers on the platform: “They want to be efficient,
they don’t want to waste money, but they also don’t want to get their buddies killed.” The commission found that problems with the cement job were a major cause of the well disaster, but the main
point was much more prosaic: a deepwater well is a highly complicated system and no single error or flaw was solely responsible. The causes are complex and bear investigation, and better safety mea-

sures are surely needed, but when we blame greed we settle for too little. We miss the larger point.

From Greed to Hubris

Often paired with greed was another word: hubris. With origins in Greek mythology, hubris refers to excessive pride that's punished by the gods. It’s irresistible to think of hubris when something goes
massively wrong.

Why do executives pay large sums of money to acquire other companies, when empirical evidence suggests that most acquisitions fail? A convenient answer is hubris, the misplaced belief that what-
ever they undertake can be made to succeed. In November 2009, Dubai World, a developer of expensive real estate projects and glamorous resorts in the United Arab Emirates, found itself overextended
as real estate prices collapsed. Jeremy Warner of The Telegraph wrote: “Like everyone else, my regard for the miracle of Dubai's fast-evolving skyline has always been tempered with a high degree of skep-
ticism. As amonument to the vanity and hubris of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, Dubai has long looked like an accident waiting to happen.” Warner may have had doubts, but like most
people, he leveled the charge of vanity and hubris after problems became apparent. In fact, during its years of rapid growth, Dubai was typically described as ambitious and bold, and Sheikh al-Maktoum
was hailed as a far-sighted visionary. As long as performance is good, no one talks about hubris. As we often say: “Pride goes before the fall.” By definition, therefore: No fall, no hubris.

Hubris, much like greed, is sometimes prominent in a books title then all but absent in the text. William D. Cohan’s highly acclaimed account of Bear Stearns was titled House of Cards: A Tale of Hubris
and Wretched Excess on Wall Street, yet hubris appears just once in the text, and then in a quote. The author himself never uses the word in nearly 500 pages of text. If the financial collapse was due to
hubris and wretched excess, we're left to guess how.

Hubris also featured in stories about the BP oil well spill. Some observers saw a modern-day image of an earlier quest for oil—whale oil—and Captain Ahab's self-destructive hunt for Moby Dick. Randy
Kennedy wrote in The New York Times: “In the weeks since the rig explosion, parallels between that disaster and the proto-Modernist one imagined by Melville more than a century and a half ago have
sometimes been striking—and painfully illuminating as the spill becomes a daily reminder of the limitations, even now, of man’s ability to harness nature for his needs. ... Now, 50 miles off the Louisi-
ana coast, its themes of hubris, destructiveness and relentless pursuit are as telling as ever.” Perhaps so, but in the weeks prior to the rig explosion, there was no mention of hubris. Press accounts tended
to emphasize the increasingly sophisticated technologies used to tap ever-more remote sources of oil, and their ability to do so safely and efficiently. Advances in four-dimensional imaging technology
and directional drilling are not only impressive but worthy of praise—so long as they're successful. When disaster strikes, of course, the evidence now points to proto-Modernist hubris.

Greed and hubris are appealing explanations in part because they convey a moral judgment. When we suggest that people displayed greed or hubris, we imply that they contributed to their downfall
through sinfulness. They deserved their fate.

By now, we know there are two problems here. First, if greed and hubris are to have any validity, they can’t just be inferred after the fact. We have to know them when we see them, and as we've seen
already, that turns out to be problematic. Second, when we blame failure on the sins of greed and hubris, we imagine that we'll avoid the misfortunes that have befallen others. After all, we think that
greed and hubris describe other people, not us. Was the collapse of Bear Stearns really due to greed, hubris, and wretched excess? Did Lehmann Brothers really fail due to greed? If so, we can take comfort

—because we don’t think those terms apply to us. And that’s a much more serious delusion.

CHAPTER TWELVE

Back to the Present

“Words are just tools, for a writer ... My primary idea, whenever I sit down to write, is to get the attention of people like you, and make you think.”

Hunter S. Thompson, letter to Carrie Neftzger, 1974, Fear and Loathing in America: The Brutal Odyssey of an Outlaw Journalist, 1968-1976

With a few more years to draw upon, we can also bring some stories up to date. What happened to the companies and characters described in earlier chapters? Did their Halos tarnish or did they retain
aglow?

When we saw him last in chapter 10, Andy Grove was urging Intel to continue to take chances. In highly competitive industries like semiconductors, where technology can change rapidly, only com-
panies that are willing to take risks will have any chance of living to see another day. True, paranoia won't always lead to success, but as Grove put it in the title of his book, Only the Paranoid Survive, any
company that survives will have exhibited something resembling paranoia. That was the story in 2006, and it was even more true in 2013, when Intel's position in microprocessors for PCs was under se-
vere pressure due to the growing popularity of tablets, smartphones, and cloud computing. Chief executive Paul Otellini announced he would step down three years short of the company retirement age,
citing the need for new leadership. Intel's chairman, Andy Bryant, told employees to prepare for major changes. Past success didn’t guarantee future profits, he reminded them. Customers had changed
and Intel would have to reinvent itself, as well. In business, company performance is best understood as relative, and strategy calls for choices made under uncertainty. As Andy Grove had known, the
greater mistake was to err on the side of complacency. The logic that had proven so successful in earlier years still held true.

Some of the forces that posed challenges for Intel were also eroding the success of Logitech. With the rise of mobile devices, the competitive landscape was shifting away from PCs, making the road
for Logitech a bumpy one. For a time it continued to grow at a rapid clip, from sales of $1.1 billion in 2002 to $2.37 billion in 2008, with profits rising steadily too. After that, however, growth slowed. In
2010 revenues were down, the combined effect of the recession compounded by customer migration to tablets, smartphones, and other devices that didn't call for a mouse or peripherals. Over the next
few years Logitech shares plunged, from $36 at the end of 2007 to less than $10 at the start of 2009. They climbed back to $20 at the end of 2010, but then headed downward again, to a low of $6.24 in

2013 before rebounding at year end.


=== 103.png ===
With some of its traditional products eroding, Logitech was searching for new ones. In early 2013 it announced a commitment to mobility products and online gaming. As for Guerrino De Luca, after
serving as president and CEO from 1998 to 2008, he was now chairman of the board of directors, where he helped point Logitech in new directions, such as devising keypads for the iPad and designing
anew generation of webcams. Logitech also unveiled its Harmony Ultimate Hub, which turned an iPhone or Android smartphone into a universal remote. That was a major change in product line, re~
ducing reliance on traditional PCs and finding new success with the shift to tablets and smartphones. Even so, universal remotes remained the target of many startups and other competitors. Matt Burns
at Tech Crunch reported: “It’s not going to get easier for the Harmony division. As more smartphone makers include IR ports within their devices, the competition will get tougher. But if the wonderful
Harmony Ultimate and the Harmony Ultimate Hub is any indication, the engineers and product managers at Logitech know what they’re doing.” By early 2014, these measures were bearing fruit, and
the share price was again moving upwards.

The varied fortunes of Intel and Logitech are not only understandable but almost inevitable given the turbulent nature of their industry. Even the wisest of managers will not navigate these waters
without mishaps. The best will need to adjust and adapt, responding to new challenges by taking risks and then insisting on disciplined execution. Neither company enjoyed a smooth ride, but both per-
sisted and even prospered.

The story of Robert Rubin, presented in chapter 10 as an exemplar of wise judgment, raises different questions.

After he left the Treasury Department in the Clinton Administration, Rubin became chairman of the executive committee at Citigroup, hired by Sandy Weill for an annual salary of more than $15
million. From that perch he worked on his memoirs, In an Uncertain World, which conveyed his understanding of the world in terms of probabilities. The cool temperament that served Rubin well during
his career at Goldman Sachs had also been useful in government service.

While at Treasury, in the late 1990s, Rubin was one of many who had supported deregulation of derivatives trading. Others expressed grave concern, with Warren Buffett presciently warning of a
“mega-catastrophic risk.” As the Sage of Omaha put it: “derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.” Buffett turned out to be
prescient, and in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, Robert Rubin stood down from his position at Citigroup. He had collected $126 million during his years of service; now Citigroup lay shattered,
reeling from losses.

When he testified before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in Washington, in April 2010, Rubin explained that the committee he chaired at Citigroup met only infrequently and had not played
“a substantive part of the decision-making process of the institution.” The chairman of the committee, former California state treasurer Phil Angelides, challenged him on that point. Either Rubin had
been in charge and grossly mistaken about the risks involved, or he had been absent at a moment of supreme importance. “I don’t know that you can have it both ways,” Angelides stated. “You either
were pulling the levers or asleep at the switch.” While others, including former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, publicly expressed regret for errors that contributed to the financial calamity,
Robert Rubin refrained from public comment. To financial reporter William D. Cohan, Rubin was “the man who wasn’t there,” missing in action when it mattered most.

For those of us who admire Robert Rubin—myself included—his role in the financial crisis is troubling. It is, of course, easy to make attributions retrospectively on the basis of outcomes. It would be
tempting to say that Rubin's instincts failed him, perhaps due to arrogance or hubris. What could seem more logical when dealing with a former executive of Goldman Sachs, a company at the center of
the financial meltdown that, to some, epitomized greed? That makes for a satisfying story, but it’s too easy. Such an explanation smacks of the same delusions and simple-minded thinking I’ve tried to
expose throughout this book. It’s a dangerous one, too, since it leads toa false sense of security. We comfort ourselves in the belief that we won't make the same sort of error, since after all, we don’t imag-
ine that we suffer from hubris or arrogance.

Parsimony is usually a better explanation than conspiracy. What's the simplest explanation here?


=== 104.png ===
Over the course of his career, Robert Rubin has been right much more often than he’s been wrong. The ability to make decisions amid uncertainty, winning many deals while losing a few, made sense
for risk arbitrage like the Becton-Dickinson transaction described in chapter 10, or even intervention on the peso in 1995. But when it comes to decisions that could imperil the entire financial system, a
different standard is required. Not only the probability of error but the potential consequences have to be considered.

In Stanley Kubrick's 1964 classic, Dr. Strangelove, a renegade Air Force general sends a squadron of B-52s to attack the Soviet Union. The American president demands an explanation of a member of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff: “[WJhen you instituted the human reliability tests, you assured me there no possibility of such a thing ever occurring.” The reply, delivered without a trace of irony by George C.
Scott, is a masterpiece of black humor: “Well, I don’t think it’s quite fair to condemn a whole program because of a single slip up sir.”

That's nonsense, of course. When a single mistake can be fatal, it’s essential to avoid even a single slip up. Normal rules of risk management—make sure that over the long run, the wins outweigh the
losses—no longer apply. We're in a different realm. The failure to recognize the possibility of financial disaster, and to guard against it, stands as an indictment of conventional thinking—and a sobering
reminder about the need to understand the consequences of risk.

It's fair to find fault with Robert Rubin and his role during the financial crisis, but if we demonize him—or any single person—we miss the most important lesson. The key point is not that people are
arrogant, or greedy, or display hubris, or suffer from some other ailment that we don’t imagine applies to us. That sort of attribution is easy to make in retrospect but spares us from looking more deeply
at ourselves and our potential for error. The most important lesson is that even people who have a long record of success and a temperament of careful judgment can let their guard down. When the con-

sequences are potentially disastrous, even a single error is one too many. We need to make sure that if things go wrong—as they invariably may—the damage is limited.

Apple, with Halos Golden and Delicious

It’s one thing to spot a Halo after the fact. Can we spot a Halo in the here-and-now? In fact, often we can.

Perhaps nowhere has the glow of the Halo Effect shone as brightly as on Apple Inc. For years, top honors on Fortune magazine's list of World’s Most Admired Companies went to the likes of General Elec-
tric, Walmart and Dell. Apple was nowhere to be seen.

All that changed with the success of the iPod and the iPhone. By 2006, Apple had moved up to eleventh place on Fortune's list of World’s Most Admired Companies. The next year, thanks to further
stellar results, Apple jumped four places to reach seventh place. Perennial star General Electric once again ranked first, followed by Starbucks and Toyota, whose reputation for quality and excellence in

manufacturing hadn't yet suffered a dent. Apple was a bit further down, but it was rising fast.

In 2008, Apple vaulted over the rest and made it to the top. As Fortune told it: “The creator of the iPod and iPhone sets a dazzling new standard for innovation and mass appeal, driven by an obsessive

CEO who wants his products to be practically perfect in every way.” Fortune continued its praise of Apple and its chief executive:

Itis a tribute to its CEO that Apple, which ten years ago seemed headed for the slag heap, is No. 1 on this list. Steve Jobs has always had a knack for weaving magic out of silicon and software. But who
knew he could build a $24 billion (in sales) company on the strength of a portable jukebox and a computer with a single-digit market share? His pitch, as he leveraged the success of the iPod, was very

simple: Apple products work, and if you buy more than one, they work better.


=== 105.png ===
Not only was Apple ranked tops overall, it was first in its industry for innovation, quality of products, and people management. For other categories it was still ranked a bit lower, rated third for long
term investment, wise use of corporate assets, quality of management, and stood fifth in social responsibility.

Apple held on to the top spot in 2009 as sales and profits continued to surge. The computer industry may have struggled amid the recession, but Apple was still riding high. Now it was rated either
first or second among computer companies on all nine attributes. Not only was Apple admired for its products and people, but its value as an investment was appreciated as well. Even social responsibil-
ity, never thought to be a particular priority of Apple, now received high marks. That's the essence of the Halo Effect—where an overall perception spills over to color specific judgments.

From there, the story gets even better. Apple remained in the top spot in 2010 when the iPad was launched to stunning success. Fortune crowed: “Steve Jobs does it again: Apple is keeping its Most
Admired crown for the third year in a row.” Not only that, Apple won by the highest margin ever recorded: “What makes Apple so admired? Product, product, product. This is the company that changed
the way we do everything from buy music to design products to engage with the world around us. Its track record for innovation and fierce consumer loyalty translates into tremendous respect across
business’ highest ranks.”

The next year, 2011, Apple made it four in a row. Its share price wavered briefly in January when Steve Jobs announced a second medical leave, but otherwise the company carried on without missing
a beat. Profits doubled from the previous year, and the iPad2 showed that the product pipeline was full. There were no serious challengers for the title of World’s Most Admired Company. Nobody else
came close.

In August 2011, Jobs's health worsened and he announced his resignation from the company. No longer was there a pretence that this would be a temporary leave; now it was widely assumed that
Jobs would not return. If observers expected the company’s stock to plummet, however, they need not have worried. Steve Jobs had long since merged his persona with that of his company, such that by
2011 a shiny Halo cast a glow over the entire firm, whether the founding visionary was present or not. When Jobs died in October 2011, investors and consumers were undaunted. They kept their eye on
Apple revenues and profits, which remained extraordinarily strong.

In 2012, now under the leadership of Tim Cook, Apple was named World’s Most Admired Company for the fifth consecutive year, a record. Behind it were other tech leaders, Google and Amazon.com,
admired in their own right but not in the same class as Apple. In fact, for the first time Apple recorded a clean sweep in all nine attributes. Not only was it number one overall, but it was tops in its in-
dustry on every one of the categories. Apple was seen as best in everything—from products to people to value as an investment and even social responsibility. So positive was Apple's reputation that it
extended to every one of the categories.

Apple made it six in a row in 2013 and once more was ranked at the top on all nine attributes. Yet cracks had begun to appear in the facade. Even as Fortune lauded Apple for its long stretch at the top,
it recognized that the company’s reputation might exceed the underlying reality. As rivals began to close the product gap, investors became less sanguine and Apple’s shares had lost 35 percent from the

previous September, and in a bull market at that. Fortune commented:

For the sixth consecutive year, Apple has earned the top ranking in Fortune's annual poll of executives asked to identify the companies they most admire. For some, the news will come as a surprise.
Headlines of late have tended to portend Apple's demise, comparing the computer and mobile-gadget maker to Microsoft (the horror) and wondering whether Apple had lost its cool factor.
Its products, while selling robustly, have lost market share to rivals and have included at least one unmitigated dud—Apple’s mediocre mapping service. Worst of all, there's a sense about the

company that it is adrift without its legendary leader, Steve Jobs, who died in late 2011, leaving behind a management team that is little known to the public.


=== 106.png ===
None of this should come as a surprise. Simply put, the nature of competition—where performance is ultimately relative and not absolute—means that no one stays ahead forever, at least not in an
industry of rapid technological change. Samsung was now a serious competitor in handsets, as was Huawei. Microsoft had launched a tablet of its own with a totally new look and feel, and appeared to
have taken a page from Apple's clean design rather than to have tried, once more, to modify Windows.

Yet perceptions endure, even beyond what might seem warranted. Stellar performance raises perceptions across the board, and once performance begins to falter, they often move down in lockstep as
well. Once Apple's torrid growth slows, as it inevitably will, it will likely decline not just in a few categories, but in many. The Halo giveth and the Halo taketh away.

Fortune claims that the World’s Most Admired Company survey is “the definitive report card on corporate reputations.” The amount of work that goes into the ratings seems impressive. The Hay Group
surveys 15,000 executives for their evaluations on nine separate attributes. However, Fortune makes no claim to measure those attributes in an objective manner. It knows that it deals only with percep-
tions. As the Hay Group instructs respondents: “Only the attribute names as listed above are provided on the survey. We simply state that ‘ratings may be based on your first-hand knowledge of these
companies or on anything you may have observed or heard about them.’ Thus, interpretation of the meaning of the attributes within a specific industry is left to the respondents.

Such an approach leads to two problems.

First is that for all the appearance of rigorous research—thousands of executives providing responses to nine separate questions, which are then combined for an overall ranking—there’s a serious
Halo Effect. Respondents may be asked nine questions, but it’s unlikely that they have nine different opinions about the company. More likely is that one or two general impressions are expressed nine
times. Moreover, the most important opinion is likely to be based on overall financial performance. Look at any company with healthy revenues and strong profits, and it’s likely that I'll infer it has good
management, high quality products, and more. The brighter the Halo, the more we're likely to see the attributes move together. And that’s exactly what happened at Apple, where exceptionally good

financial results helped to make it the most admired company in the world. Recall how its score of social responsibility at first lagged behind the others but then came into line, so that Apple eventually

ranked tops in that category as well as all the others. Did Apple really take a more active interest in the working conditions of manufacturers like Foxconn, where employee abuse and suicide have made
the headlines? Did it look for ways to bring more employment back to the United States? Not at all. Its high ranking for social responsibility was the result of nothing more than a strong Halo. For most
people, a company that’s seen to be a high performer must be good across the boards. Believing otherwise—recognizing it may be outstanding at some attributes but remain poor at others—is an uncom-
fortable thought, an example of cognitive dissonance.

Second, and even more problematic, is that this research gives a false idea of what companies can do to improve their place in the rankings. In its 2013 edition, Fortune summarized the findings of the

previous fifteen years. Some of the highlights:

+ 90 percent of the World’s Most Admired Companies (WMAC) succeed in aligning various business units/subsidiaries around a common strategic vision versus 78 percent of peers.
+94 percent of WMAC managers and employees are encouraged to take reasonable risks to improve effectiveness versus 77 percent of peers.

+79 percent of managers at WMAC understand their roles and responsibilities in implementing strategy versus 58 percent of peers.

+61 percent of WMAC use planned career assignments in developing high potential future leaders versus 35 percent of peers.

+ 82 percent of WMAC regularly reinforce rewards philosophy in communications with employees versus 64 percent of peers.

+94 percent of WMAC feel that their efforts to engage employees have reduced turnover versus 67 percent of peers.


=== 107.png ===
And so, by implication, we are led to conclude that companies that wish to be ranked among the Most Admired should align their units around a common strategic vision, encourage reasonable risk
taking, make sure managers understand their roles and responsibilities, and so on. Since the companies that are ranked among the World’s Most Admired Companies do these things, it stands to reason
that a company which improves on these attributes has a good chance of joining that august list.

The problem is that without an independent measure of these attributes, nor anything more than data gathered at a single point in time, we have no way to determine if these attributes drive overall
admiration, or whether the direction of causality is exactly the reverse, and that successful companies are highly admired overall, therefore perceived to do well on these many attributes.

Does good alignment of organizational units, and a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities, really bring about better performance? That might seem reasonable, but there’s no supporting
evidence. Or is the reverse true, and high performance leads us to admire companies that in turn we perceive to be in alignment and that we perceive to communicate clearly roles and responsibilities? In
fact, that’s the more likely explanation.

But all isn’t lost. Ultimately we can come back the lessons of chapter 10. There may be no formula to guarantee high performance, but there are two ways to improve our chances of success: Wise

strategic choice and rigorous execution—not merely inferred from performance, but measured on its own. Do those things, and you improve your chances of success.

Back to the Blocks

To bring the story full circle, let’s return to the example at the outset of the book. When we first encountered Lego, the Danish toy maker, in chapter 1, its performance had fallen sharply. Sales had
plunged by 26 percent from 11.4 billion Danish kroner in 2002 to 8.4 billion kroner in 2003, and then fell another 20 percent to 7.9 billion kroner in 2004. The reason? We were told that Lego had strayed
from its core. It had lost sight of what made it great. Consultants and industry experts offered a variety of suggestions for improvement, all aimed at restoring Lego’s Wow factor.

It all made for a wonderful story, but on closer examination it wasn’t quite right. In fact, Lego had never abandoned its core. It had always stayed with what made it a great success—wonderful little
toys that enchanted children, now including electronics and tied in to popular movies like Star Wars and the Harry Potter saga.

Lego’s biggest problem was simpler: it had a bloated cost structure that left it unable to serve customers in a cost-effective manner. The seeds had been planted long before. As it expanded during years
of prosperous growth, Lego set up manufacturing operations around the world, all with the aim of being close to its customers. The result, by 2003, was a hodgepodge of small factories, none of which
was large enough to be efficient by world-class standards. As Lego sets became ever-more complex—precisely in an effort to give customers what they wanted—the company had 12,500 SKUs (stock
keeping units, or different items) in more than 100 colors, and relied on a staggering array of 11,000 suppliers. With production scattered, it needed four regional distributions centers in Europe alone—
two in France, one in Germany, and one in Denmark—which made deliveries to more than 14,000 separate wholesalers and retailers. In Europe, Lego looked to eleven logistic operations to manage the
flow of products and worked with sixty different transportation companies to move those products from one place to another. Children still loved Lego's products, but the company’s supply chain was
obsolete. Products remained at a high quality, but manufacturing and shipping was no longer adequate. Nor could Lego respond to seasonal swings of demand ina timely manner. The entire process
‘was so complex that Lego’s plants ran at only 70 percent capacity. The company’s very motto—“Only the best is good enough”—had led to a focus on quality with an unforeseen and unfortunate side

effect, a monumental lack of efficiency.


=== 108.png ===
Beginning in 2004, under new president and CEO Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, Lego launched an action plan that aimed for a complete transformation of activities. None of them called for rethinking
Lego’s core. Among the most important moves were described as “substantial cost reductions and efficiency measures.” First, Lego made the painful decision to outsource or relocate manufacturing. It
shut many of its plants and set up new factories in Eastern Europe and Mexico. More than 900 jobs were lost in the company’s hometown of Billund, Denmark. A large factory in the Czech Republic was
outsourced to Flextronics. In distribution and logistics, too, Lego overhauled its operations. Multiple distribution centers were consolidated into a single site in the Czech Republic, for which operational
responsibility was given to DHL, the global logistics company.

Thanks to these vigorous measures, performance improved rapidly and profits soon returned. Already by 2006, Lego met its operating margin goal of 13.5 percent. By 2008, it reported record sales of
11.5 billion kroner and profits of 2.8 billion kroner, an increase of almost 40 percent from 2008. With continued product innovation supported by an efficient supply chain, Lego was now thriving. In its
2010 annual report, the company observed, in an example of Danish understatement, that “The result is considered highly satisfactory.” Results the following year were even more impressive, reaching
another new record level of sales, 16 billion kroner, as well as profits of 3.7 billion kroner. As sales surged, capacity was added at its two major plants in the Czech Republic and Mexico. The transforma-
tion of a traditional Danish company into a world-class global operation was now complete.

Lego’s turnaround was due largely to improved efficiency of operations and excellence in execution. Of course, if we're not careful, we might imagine that any company with strong sales and profits
must be efficient. We might conclude that it must execute well and also must be customer focused. Take any company with Wow revenues and profits, and it’s easy to say that its product designers man-
aged to restore the Wow factor. That reflects a simplistic kind of thinking, where we begin with outcomes and make causal inferences. In fact, Lego’s excellence in operations was not merely inferred
from results, but could be measured objectively—with metrics like product quality, throughput time, order fill rate, cost per unit, and more.

Today, Lego is a very different company from the one described at the start of this book. It’s tempting to say that Lego has better leadership, but that only pushes the question back one step. It’s what
the new CEO and his top executives did that made a difference. Similarly, it’s convenient to say Lego became more customer focused, but a closer look suggests Lego has always been focused on its
customers; what made the difference was an improved internal focus, on operational efficiency. We might also claim Lego’s culture improved, and very likely an internal poll would show that morale
is higher, but that is more likely the result of improved performance than the cause. It’s entirely predictable that employees are happier and more committed than they were in 2004. Of course. All else
equal, employees at high performing companies will always be more satisfied.

What really drives company performance? The fundamental things apply. Strategy is about making smart choices and execution is about relentless implementation. Which is precisely what Lego did.

Bestow all the Halos you wish, as gurus and journalists and self-described experts will always be ready to do, but the truth is often simpler. Our task is to see that truth more clearly.


=== 11.png ===
Ted Williams, the great Red Sox outfielder, once said there was one thing he always found irritating: With runners on base and the opposing team’s slugger coming to the plate, the manager walks to
the mound and says to the pitcher, “Don’t give the batter a good pitch, but don’t walk him,” then turns around and marches back to the dugout. Pointless! said Ted. Of course the pitcher doesn’t want to
give the batter anything good to hit, and of course he doesn’t want to walk him. The pitcher already knows that! The only useful advice is, “In this situation, it’s better to throw a strike because you really
don’t want to walk this hitter,” or, “It’s better to walk this hitter because in this situation you really don’t want to throw him a strike.” But baseball managers, like industry analysts, find it easier to ask for
the best of both.

One final note about the toy business. Lost in all the sound and fury about Lego was the fact that other toy makers were struggling, too. The largest U.S. toy maker, Mattel, in the midst of a multiyear
turnaround after several poor years, announced in July 2004 that sales of its best-known product, the Barbie doll, had fallen by 13 percent. Part of Barbie's woes stemmed from a rival product, MGA En-
tertainment’s Bratz dolls, said to be an “edgier fashion doll,” which had eaten into Barbie's market share. What was Mattel planning to do in order to revive Barbie sales? Focus on its core? No, it planned
anew line based on the American Idol television show and a fashion-based line called “Fashion Fever.” Months after Lego concluded that merchandising spin-offs were a bad idea, Mattel decided to take

that very approach.

Drifting with WH Smith, Expanding with Nokia

Lego isn’t the only company to be criticized for wandering off course. Consider WH Smith, the troubled newspaper and magazine retail chain. WH Smith got its start more than a hundred years ago as a
London newspaper distributor, and over time moved into bookstalls and stores. Nothing odd about that. The New York Times reported: “It was in the 1980s that WH Smith began to diversify well beyond
books and periodicals, adding music, office supplies, stationery, and gifts to its store shelves. But in drifting away from its core products, analysts said, the company also made itself vulnerable to compe-
tition.” WH Smith now found itself competing with supermarkets and other large surface stores—a dangerous game.

Note the word: drifting. According to the Times, WH Smith didn't expand or diversify, it drifted. The American Heritage Dictionary defines to drift as “to move from place to place with no particular
goal,” “to be carried along by currents of air or water,” “to wander from a set course or point of attention; to stray.” A raft can be cast adrift, left to move with the currents. Wood that flows in and out with
the tides is driftwood. A person with no direction or aims is a drifter. (At the start of The Magnificent Seven, the rootlessness—and availability for hire—of the gunfighters is conveyed in this exchange be-

tween Steve McQueen and Yul Brynner. “Where are you heading?” asks McQueen. Brynner answers: “I’m drifting south, more or less. And you?” McQueen shrugs. “Just drifting.

Well, who says that WH Smith drifted? Who says that selling music and office supplies is an example of wandering off course? Why should we think that WH Smith had no particular goal when it
added stationery and gifts? It didn't get into book publishing. It didn’t try to sell fresh food or alcoholic beverages. WH Smith didn’t add products that call for explanations by salespeople, like electronic
equipment, or products that might involve returns. All it did was add a few other fast-moving consumables. It expanded the range of products on its shelves, nothing more. Isn’t that exactly what

WH Smith should be doing—identify adjacent areas that draw on its existing capabilities and that appeal to its core customers? In fact, WH Smith’s dilemma sounds like a classic problem of format
expansion: As large stores and supermarkets expanded their formats to include some of WH Smith’s products, WH Smith had to decide whether to sit still and suffer the consequences, or respond by
expanding its format. It could well be that given the circumstances, adding music and office supplies was the best move it could have made. Maybe WH Smith was unable to execute its new format for

some reason—bad inventory management or poor logistics—or maybe it simply couldn't match the buying power of Wal-Mart and Safeway. But that’s very different from saying WH Smith drifted.


=== 12.png ===
Let's fast-forward and see if we can spot a good strategy while it’s happening. Nokia had been the leader in mobile phone handsets since the mid-1990s, combining technological excellence, sleek
designs, and shrewd branding to build the world’s largest market share. But by 2004, the Finnish-based company had begun to feel the heat from tougher competition, much of it coming from low-cost
Asian rivals. Mobile phones, those clever compact items that now included cameras and calendars and calculators and radios, were in danger of becoming a commodity—and Nokia's margins were under
pressure. So what was Nokia going to do? Would it redouble its focus on the core and ramp up its investment in handsets? Not at all. According to Business Week, Nokia was intent on “expanding into
mobile gaming, imaging, music, and even complex wireless systems for corporations.” These new areas were appealing for their growth and promise of higher margins, but they were far from Nokia's
core of handset design and manufacturing. They were further from Nokia's core than stationery was from WH Smith's core or Harry Potter toys were from Lego’s core. So why didn’t Business Week say
that Nokia was straying or drifting? Why was Nokia merely expanding? Because, at the time, no one knew if Nokia would succeed or fail, so Business Week chose a nice neutral verb, expand. Plus, in plenty
of ways, Nokia's strategy made sense—it was shifting from a tough low-margin business into new areas that promised higher margins. If Nokia could make this change work, it would be celebrated for
its nimble strategy and clever management. Of course, if Nokia failed, reporters would say it had erred by moving into areas it didn’t understand; it strayed or drifted. The chief executive (or his replace-
ment, if he met the same fate as Poul Plougmann) might then decide Nokia should go back to basics and try even harder with the girl it brought to the dance in the first place, handsets. Yet if Nokia had
decided to stick to handsets while its market share was collapsing and margins were imploding, we'd have probably read that Nokia was complacent, inward looking, and conservative. No wonder Nokia

failed, we'd be told. It didn’t react to a shift in the market. It didn’t change with the times.

The Mother of All Business Questions

These accounts about Lego, WH Smith, and Nokia are all variants of the most basic question in the business world: What leads to high performance? It’s the mother of all business questions, a Wall Street
equivalent of the Holy Grail. Why does one company achieve great success, turning its shareholders into millionaires, while another company just muddles through, earning a modest profit but never
catching fire or, even worse, failing altogether? The fact is, it’s often hard to know exactly why one company succeeds and another fails. Did Lego make a mistake when it added merchandising tie-ins?
At the time, the decision seemed to make sense. It was only later, after the results were in, that Lego’s initiatives were described as misguided and ill considered. But that’s in retrospect. Lego’s venture
turned out badly, yes, but that does not necessarily make it a mistake. Plenty of other things, from currency shifts to competitors’ actions to sudden shifts in consumer taste, could have helped bury
Lego. Plus it’s not clear that any of the alternatives would have been more successful. Yet when we read a word like stray, it’s hard to escape the conclusion that Lego erred—the very word implies a damn-
ing judgment. If we had a better idea of what Nokia's new directions would lead to, we would use a more precise term than expand—we might more confidently describe it either as ill-advised or as bril-
liant. But we don’t.

Or consider a little discount retailer, founded in a small Arkansas town in 1962. How did Wal-Mart grow up to be the biggest company in the world, spinning its cash registers to the tune of $1 billion
per day, so big that it accounts for 30 percent of the sales of Procter & Gamble, that it sells 25 percent of all disposable diapers and 20 percent of all magazines sold in the United States, so powerful that
it can censor magazines and CDs by threatening not to carry them? How did Wal-Mart become such a success? There's no shortage of theories: Perhaps it was a strategy of “everyday low prices,” or a
relentless obsession with detail, or a culture that gets ordinary people to do their best, or a sophisticated use of information technology in supply chain management, or maybe a bare-knuckled approach

to squeezing its suppliers. Are some of these explanations right? Are all of them right? Which are most important? Do some work only in combination with others? Some explanations, like Wal-Mart's


=== 13.png ===
use of its sheer scale to get the lowest input costs, help explain high performance today but don't tell us how the company got so big in the first place. These questions are important because if we want to
learn from Wal-Mart, if we want some of Wal-Mart's success to rub off on our companies, which lessons should we learn? The fact is, it’s hard to be sure. As Frank Sinatra, the Chairman of the Board, used
to sing: “How little we know, how much to discover.”

Of course, we don't like to admit how little we know. The social psychologist Eliot Aronson observed that people are not rational beings so much as rationalizing beings. We want explanations. We
want the world around us to make sense. We may not know exactly why Lego ran into a brick wall, or why WH Smith fell on hard times, or why Wal-Mart has done so well, but we want to feel that we
know what happened. We want the comfort of a plausible explanation, so we say that a company strayed or drifted. Or take the stock market, whose daily fluctuations, edging higher one day and abit
lower the next, resemble Brownian motion, the jittery movement of pollen particles in water or of gas molecules bouncing off one another. It’s not very satisfying to say that today’s stock market move-
ment is explained by random forces. Tune in to CNBC and listen to the pundits as they watch the ticker, and you'll hear them explain, “The Dow is up slightly as investors gain confidence from rising
factory orders,” or, “The Dow is off by a percentage point as investors take profits,” or, “The Dow is a bit higher as investors shrug off worries about the Fed’s next move on interest rates.” They have to say

something. Maria Bartiromo can’t exactly look into the camera and say that the Dow is down half a percent today because of random Brownian motion.

Science and the Study of Business

But all of this begs a larger question. If we have difficulty pinpointing what drives company performance, why is that? It’s certainly not for lack of trying. Thousands of very smart and hardworking
people in business schools and research centers and consulting firms spend a great deal of time and effort looking for answers. There’s a huge amount at stake. So why are explanations about company
performance so often riddled with clichés and simplistic phrases?

Inother fields, from medicine to chemistry to aeronautical engineering, knowledge seems to march ahead relentlessly. What do these fields have in common? In a word, these fields move forward
thanks toa form of inquiry we call science. Richard Feynman once defined science as “a method for trying to answer questions which can be put into the form: If I do this, what will happen?” Science isn't
about beauty or truth or justice or wisdom or ethics. It’s eminently practical. It asks, If I do something over here, what will happen over there? If I apply this much force, or that much heat, or if mix
these chemicals, what will happen? By this definition, What leads to sustained profitable growth? is a scientific question. It asks, Ifa company does this or that, what will happen to its revenues or profits
or share price?

How should we answer a scientific question? Feynman explained: “The technique of it, fundamentally, is: Try it and see. Then you put together a large amount of information from such experiences.”
In other words, you conduct experiments and put together information in systematic ways to deduce rules that govern the phenomena and that can lead to accurate predictions. The great thing about
sciences like physics and chemistry is that we can run experiments—try it and see—in carefully constructed laboratory settings that let us control the settings, adjust the inputs, and observe the results.
Then we can tinker with a few variables, alter some settings, and try again. Scientific progress owes a great deal to the careful and incremental refinement of experiments.

But what about the business world, which takes place not in a laboratory, but in the messy and complex world around us? Do business questions lend themselves to scientific investigation? Can we
devise alternative hypotheses and test them with carefully designed experiments, so that we can support some explanations and reject others? In many instances, the answer is yes. Plenty of business

questions lend themselves to scientific experimentation. Imagine you want to know where to place an item ina supermarket, or what effect a price change will have on the quantity of a product sold,


=== 14.png ===
or what effect a special promotion will have. What can you do? Simple, you can run trials in different stores and compare the answers. You can find out what works in a given setting. If I do this, what
will happen? In fact, just about any situation with an abundance of similar transactions affords a natural setting for experiments. One explanation of Wal-Mart's success is that it was among the first re-
tailers to apply scientific rigor to merchandising, studying the patterns of consumption and understanding the behavioral traits of its customers, then applying its findings to everything from logistics
management to store layout. Likewise, some of the best Internet companies, such as Amazon.com and eBay, use highly sophisticated techniques to track customer clicks and understand their choices.
Another example is Harrah's Entertainment, one of America’s leading gambling companies—the polite word is gaming—with hundreds of thousands of customers visiting its casinos every day. When
Gary Loveman came on board as chief operating officer in 1998, he didn’t just see rows of slot machines and card tables and roulette wheels—he saw a fabulous laboratory for running experiments. He
saw that Harrah's loyalty card, Total Gold, gathered huge amounts of data about thousands of customers and their preferences. Using these data, Harrah’s could run experiments and analyze the out-

comes, then make adjustments to improve customer satisfaction and retention. For example, Harrah's could configure casino floors with just the right mix of slot machines to benefit both customers

and the company. Did Loveman's experiments meet the standard of science? You bet. And the results were dramatic: Revenues and profits were way up, both in absolute terms and relative to Harrah’s
competitors. Scientific thinking—try it and see—helped Harrah's improve its performance.

But other questions in business don't easily lend themselves to this sort of experimentation. Take a major strategic initiative, like the launch of a new product. Coca-Cola didn’t get two chances to
launch New Coke in 1985—it got one bite at the apple and famously got it completely wrong. Daimler had just one shot at acquiring Chrysler, and mistakes were hard, if not impossible, to undo. Ditto
AOL and Time Warner—a complex merger between two entirely different corporate cultures in a rapidly changing industry. Steve Case and Gerald Levin had no way to conduct experiments. There's

simply no way to bring the rigor of experimentation to questions like these. Want to know the best way to manage an acquisition? We can’t buy 100 companies, manage half of them in one way and half

in another way, and compare the results. We can’t run that sort of experiment.

Science, Pseudoscience, and Coconut Headsets

Our inability to capture the full complexity of the business world through scientific experiments has provided fodder for some critics of business schools. Management gurus Warren Bennis and James
O'Toole, ina 2005 Harvard Business Review article, criticized business schools for their reliance on the scientific method. They wrote: “This scientific model is predicated on the faulty assumption that
business is an academic discipline like chemistry or geology when, in fact, business is a profession and business schools are professional schools—or should be.” The notion seems to be that since busi-

ness will never be understood with the precision of the natural sciences, it’s best understood as a sort of humanity, a realm where the logic of scientific inquiry doesn’t apply. Well, yes and no. It may be

true that business cannot be studied with the rigor of chemistry or geology, but that doesn’t mean that all we have is intuition and gut feel. There's no need to veer from one extreme to the other. There's
plenty of room between the natural sciences and the humanities, after all. We might not be able to buy 100 companies and run an experiment, but we can study acquisitions that have already taken

place and look for patterns. We can examine some key variables like company size, industry, and the integration process, and then see what leads to better or worse results. That approach—called quasi-
experimentation—is a staple of social science. It may never reach the ideal of the natural sciences, but it comes about as close as we can get to applying the spirit of scientific inquiry to some key business

decisions.


=== 15.png ===
In fact, there's a great deal of very good social science research about company performance, and I’ll review some of it in future chapters. But much of it, precisely because it’s done carefully and is
circumspect in its findings, tends not to provide clear and definitive guidelines for action. It’s just not very appealing to read that a given action has a measurable but small impact on company success.
Managers don’t usually care to wade through discussions about data validity and methodology and statistical models and probabilities. We prefer explanations that are definitive and offer clear implica-
tions for action. We want to explain Lego’s fortunes quickly, simply, and with an appealing logic. We like stories.

It’s useful to make the distinction between reports and stories. A report is above all responsible for providing the facts, without manipulation or interpretation. If the accounts about Lego and WH
Smith are meant to be reports—which presumably they are, since they're written by reporters—then words like stray and drift are problematic. Stories, on the other hand, are a way that people try to
make sense of their lives and their experiences in the world. The test of a good story isn't its responsibility to the facts as much as its ability to provide a satisfying explanation of events. As stories, the
news accounts about Lego and WH Smith work just fine. In a few paragraphs, the reader learns of the problem (sales and profits are down), gets a plausible explanation (the company lost its direction),
and learns a lesson (don't stray, focus on the core). There's a neat end with a clean resolution. No threads are left hanging. Readers go away satisfied.

Now, there's nothing wrong with stories, provided we understand that’s what we have before us. More insidious, however, are stories that are dressed up to look like science. They take the form of
science and claim to have the authority of science, but they miss the real rigor and logic of science. They're better described as pseudoscience. Richard Feynman had an even more memorable phrase:

Cargo Cult Science. Here's the way Feynman described it:

In the South Seas there is a cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they've arranged to make things like runways,
to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas—he’s the con-
troller—and they wait for the airplanes to land. They're doing everything right. The form is perfect. But it doesn’t work. No airplanes land. So I call these things Cargo Cult Science, because they follow all

the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they're missing something essential, because the planes don't land.

That's not to say that Cargo Cult Science doesn’t have some benefits. The folks who wait patiently by the landing strips on their tropical island, dressed up like flight controllers and wearing a pair of
coconut headsets, may derive some contentment from the whole process—they may live in hope of a better future, they may enjoy having something to believe in, and they may feel closer to supernatu-
ral powers. But it’s just that—it’s a story. It’s not a good predictor of what will happen next.

The business world is full of Cargo Cult Science, books and articles that claim to be rigorous scientific research but operate mainly at the level of storytelling. In later chapters, we'll look at some of this
research—some that meet the standards of science but aren’t satisfying as stories, and some that offer wonderful stories but are doubtful as science. As we'll see, some of the most successful business
books of recent years, perched atop the bestseller lists for months on end, cloak themselves in the mantle of science, but have little more predictive power than a pair of coconut headsets on a tropical

island.

CHAPTER TWO

The Story of Cisco

Those who rewrite history probably do believe with parts of their minds that they are actually thrusting facts into the past. ... They feel that their own version was what happened in the sight of God,

and that one is justified in rearranging the records accordingly.

George Orwell

Notes on Nationalism, 1945

The examples we've seen so far, about Lego, WH Smith, and Nokia, were drawn from articles in the business press, by reporters writing under a tight deadline, perhaps based on little more than a com-
pany press release. It’s no wonder so many of them relied on clichés and stock phrases. But what about studies of a single company over several years? Perhaps examining a company over time can offer a
better understanding of its performance.

One of the most basic measures of company performance is shareholder value, and by that measure, Cisco Systems ranks as one of the highest performers of all time. It reached a market value of $100
billion faster than any other company in history, and then, for one brief, shining moment—two weeks, actually, in March 2000—Cisco was the tops, surpassing Microsoft as the most valuable company
in the world, worth a staggering $555 billion. In the five years after he became Cisco’s chief executive, John Chambers presided over an increase of $450 billion in shareholder value, a clip of more than
$90 billion per year—which works out to $1 billion every four days, or $250 million every single day of the year, including Sundays and holidays, for five straight years. High performance indeed.

Was it all just a bubble? True, Cisco's share price slumped badly at the end of 2000 and fell further in 2001, then languished far below its peak levels for the next two years. But as the economy began
to revive, Cisco's market capitalization picked up, and by 2005 it stood at $116 billion, making Cisco the seventeenth most valuable company in the United States. It ranked ahead of durable legends like
Coca-Cola, ChevronTexaco, and Disney. It was worth more than 3M and American Express put together. Not exactly what you'd expect if the company was nothing but smoke and mirrors.

‘Another way to measure firm performance is to leave Wall Street aside and look at a company’s ability to generate profits on a sustained basis. If we take that approach, Cisco still deserves very strong
marks thanks to its ever growing sales, topping $24 billion in 2005, while also generating very high profit margins. Any way we look at it, Cisco Systems has been a stellar performer. If we want to

explain firm performance, the obvious place to look is at a company with one of the best performances of all—because if we can’t explain Cisco's success, how can we hope to explain a lesser case? For-


=== 17.png ===
tunately, Cisco has been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, case studies, and at least a couple of books. So let’s take a look at how reporters and managers and professors explained one company’s

success.

Once upon a Time in the Valley

Right from the start, the story of Cisco had a fairy-tale quality. In John Chambers and the Cisco Way, John K. Waters began the tale this way:

The legend of the founding of Cisco Systems is a Silicon Valley classic. Sandra K. Lerner and Leonard Bosack met in graduate school, fell in love, and married. After graduating, they took jobs managing
computer networks located at different corners of the sixteen-square-mile Stanford campus. They longed to exchange romantic e-mail, but their networks were incompatible. Sandy supervised the

computers at Stanford's graduate school of business, while Bosack worked five hundred yards away at the computer science lab.

The solution to incompatible networks was something called a multiprotocol router, which allowed computers to exchange data. Lerner and Bosack devised the router, founded the company, and the
rest was history. Well, that’s the legend—the story we read over and over. And it’s about right, at least as far as I can tell, twenty years later and more than a few hundred miles away.

Like many start-ups, Cisco began by operating out of a basement and at first sold its wares to friends and professional acquaintances. Once revenues approached $1 million, Lerner and Bosack went
in search of venture capital. The man who finally said yes was Donald Valentine at Sequoia Capital, the seventy-seventh moneyman they approached, who invested $2.5 million in exchange for a third of
the stock and management control. Valentine began to professionalize Cisco's management, bringing in as CEO an industry veteran, John Morgridge. Sales grew rapidly, from $1.5 million in 1987 to $28
million in 1989, and in February 1990, Cisco went public. At the end of the first day of trading, its market capitalization stood at $222 million. Over the next years, Morgridge and Valentine continued to
guide the company upward, and in a pattern repeated often in Silicon Valley, the founders soon left, squeezed out, their time done.

In 1991, when Cisco was still a relatively small and rather speculative venture, one of dozens like it in the Valley, Valentine and Morgridge brought on board a sales executive named John Chambers.
Most profiles of Chambers describe him in the same way: humble but also driven, charismatic but self-effacing, a low-key supersalesman. He had grown up in the white-shirt culture of IBM and then
moved to Wang Labs, two big computer companies that had suffered sharp downturns. Now Chambers was ready to hitch his star to a smaller company, one he could help shape.

A turning point for Cisco came in 1993. Although sales of the core product, routers, remained strong, Chambers devised a new strategic plan. Along with CEO Morgridge and Chief Technology Officer
Ed Kozel, Chambers decided that Cisco would put together a broad product line and become a one-stop shop for the wired world, dominating the market for Internet infrastructure. There was only one
hitch. The market was growing so fast, and new technologies were so unpredictable, that Cisco couldn't hope to grow on its own. Drawing up a grid that showed the full range of products, Chambers
suggested that Cisco fill in the blanks by acquiring small companies. Over the next weeks, Cisco scouted for start-ups, identifying hot new technologies and clever engineers. Soon it made a first acquisi-
tion, buying Crescendo Communications, a LAN-switching company, for $97 million. That was just an appetizer—over the next three years, Cisco would acquire two dozen companies.

In 1995, John Morgridge retired and John Chambers became Cisco's CEO. Under his guidance, Cisco soon morphed into a New Economy juggernaut. It bought thirteen more companies in 1996, almost
all of them small, but one “really big fish,” StrataCom, a maker of frame relay devices and switches with 1,200 employees and revenues of $400 million. With the Internet economy exploding all around,

and bolstered by its several acquisitions, Cisco's revenues reached $4 billion in 1997. Now it began to attract notice in the press. A March 1997 article in Wired described Cisco in cultlike terms, filled


=== 18.png ===
with “shiny, happy people” working long hours but “loving every minute of it.” It elaborated: “These folks do work that is difficult, that takes long hours, that can be exquisitely frustrating and twisted.
They are basically very, very good mechanics of a type that is peculiar to our age: they build the plumbing of the Internet.” Yet there was something unusual about this company: “Nobody has this much
fun going to work,” Wired commented. “And all they do is smile, smile, smile.” One month later, Business Week ran a feature story about Cisco, calling it a “high tech whiz.” It was “the undisputed king of
networking equipment and one of the troika that sets the industry's agenda: Cisco is to the information highway what Microsoft Corp is to software and Intel is to computer chips.” And the reasons for
this success? Business Week explained it was due to more than happy, shiny people: “Thanks to Chambers’ seemingly flawless management, slick salesmanship, and a scorching series of acquisitions .

Cisco has gone from relative obscurity to computer industry superstardom.” Two weeks later, in May 1997, Fortune ran its own feature article on Cisco, anointing it as“

‘omputing’s New Superpower.” In
Fortune's words, Cisco had “surfed the internet tsunami with more aplomb than perhaps any other company, deftly maneuvering into new areas of networking technology with lightning quick acquisi-
tions.” Note the words: Cisco wasn't straying from its core or drifting, but deftly maneuvering into new areas.

Cisco rode the crest of the Internet wave in 1998. Revenues reached $8.5 billion, six times the 1995 level. Cisco had a 40 percent share of the $20 billion data-networking equipment industry—routers,
hubs, and devices that made up the so-called plumbing of the Internet—and a massive 80 percent share of the high-end router market. But Cisco wasn't just growing revenues. It was profitable, too. Ata
time when even the most admired Internet start-ups, like Amazon.com, were losing money, Cisco posted operating margins of 60 percent. This wasn't some dot-com with a business plan, way out there
in the blue, riding on a smile anda shoeshine. It wasn’t panning for Internet gold, it was selling picks and shovels to miners who were lining up around the corner to buy them. And Wall Street loved
it. Cisco was “Big C,” an unstoppable force that slightly surpassed Wall Street expectations quarter after quarter. In July 1998, The Wall Street Journal reported: “Of all the recent bull market milestones,
fewer were as impressive as the one reached last Friday by Cisco Systems. The maker of computer-networking gear saw its market capitalization roll past $100 billion.” Cisco had reached the magic mark
in record time, after just twelve years. Microsoft, the former champ, had taken twenty years to reach that size. In September 1998, Fortune crowned Cisco as “The Real King of the Internet.” It wrote that
Chambers “has spun nothing but sweetness for investors, turning Cisco's stock into the closest thing to a sure bet in the technology business.” By now, Cisco had bought twenty-nine companies. Cham-
bers’s willingness to buy, rather than invent, the technology he needed was unusual for Silicon Valley. While many high-tech companies looked at acquiring new technology asa sign of weakness, Cham-
bers took the opposite view—in fact, he thought that a refusal to look outside was an example of the insular thinking that had hurt IBM.

It was onward and upward for Cisco in 1999. The larger it got, the faster it grew—and vice versa. And where was Cisco going next? Beyond routers and switches, into a much bigger league—the $250
billion-a-year market for telecom equipment, where Cisco so far had only a tiny share. The room for growth was immense! Of course, expanding into this segment would put Cisco in direct competition

with some heavy hitters—Lucent, Nortel, and Alcatel. Were analysts worried that Cisco was straying from the core? Not at all. As long as Cisco delivered good results, analysts wrote that diversification

made sense. JP Morgan commented: “Chambers has diversified the product line and motivated his managers to stay completely focused on customers. Cisco is off to a very fast start, and if you give them

alead they’re nearly impossible to catch.” SG Cowen Securities added: “They're just getting started” with telephone companies. MCI WorldCom, Sprint, Swisscom, and other major telecoms were all plan-

ning to buy Cisco products.

Explaining Cisco’s Success

From 1997 through 2000, Cisco was featured in numerous lengthy articles in the leading American business magazines. The question implicit in these stories? Why was this company—this one rather


=== 19.png ===
than some other one—doing so well? A few themes emerged. In just about every account, credit was given to John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive. Many profiles touched on the same points. How
Chambers was the son of two doctors in Charleston, West Virginia. How he had overcome dyslexia to go to law school, then taken a job with IBM. How he had seen IBM and Wang stumble by failing to
react to important shifts in technology. Chambers reflected: “I learned at both companies that if you don’t stay ahead of trends, they'll destroy everything you work for and tragically disrupt the lives of
your employees. I don’t ever want to go through that again.” It was an inspiring story. And with Chambers at the helm, Cisco would never repeat those mistakes—it would remain lean and humble and
nimble. It would take the best points from IBM and combine them with the drive and passion and vision of the New Economy.

Asecond element often mentioned was Cisco's remarkable skill at acquiring companies. Fortune wroti

‘Think of Cisco as an acquisition engine, as cleverly designed and highly tuned as the giant
routers it builds to handle vast surges of Internet traffic.” What made Cisco so good at acquisitions? Part of the explanation was Cisco's ability to select the best companies to buy. There was no shortage
of possible candidates, from small start-ups to large established companies. Identifying the right companies was the job of thirty-three-year-old wunderkind Michelangelo (Mike) Volpi, said to have
a knack for identifying start-up companies at just the right moment. A Harvard Business School case study focused on Cisco's strategy of growth through acquisitions. It agreed that Cisco was highly
disciplined, going after small companies with products that could immediately take their place in Cisco’s offerings, but avoiding speculative and unrelated acquisitions. It would buy no large companies,
or any far away from its California base, or any with a very different corporate culture. Why? Because Cisco wanted to pick off small and similar companies that could be easily absorbed. Prior to every
acquisition, Cisco performed a thorough due diligence using a cross-functional team with representatives from marketing, engineering, and manufacturing. It was said to care as much about cultural fit
as technology fit.

Finding the right companies to acquire was only part of the story. Cisco wasn’t just doing deals, it was integrating new companies with great results. Fortune observed that Cisco excelled at digesting

acquisitions smoothly. What were the keys to its success? First, Cisco had a dedicated team whose sole job was to “repot” start-ups into the larger company. The Harvard case study reported that after a

deal closed, Cisco followed a systematic postacquisi

ion integration process with clear expectations for specific milestones at 90 days and 180 days. It commented: “Integration success was due in large
part to the very organized, methodical approach that Cisco took toward managing the experience of acquired employees.” But Cisco was also said to address the human dimension of integrations. After
all, small high-tech companies didn’t just bring assets or customers—they were attractive mainly for their people. Smooth integration was critical to keep talent on board, and on this score Cisco was
said to do a terrific job. It cared about the soft side of merger integration, helping to bring new employees on board, making them feel part of the team—by handing out Cisco baseball caps, for example,
to help build company identity. Fortune wrote: “When Cisco absorbs a company, it makes a no-layoffs pledge; its turnover rate for employees acquired through mergers is a scant 2.1% vs. an industry
average of 20%,” Finally, Cisco's approach struck the right balance between flexibility and discipline. While each acquisition was unique and required some customization, there were numerous manda-

tory steps, including the merger of information systems and adoption of manufacturing methods. Whereas other companies made infrequent acquisitions and had to learn tough lessons each time,

Cisco was making a science of acquisitions. In 1999, it was ranked number one by the Chapel Hill, N.C., consulting company Best Practices, following a client survey about successful merger-and-acqui-

sition policies.

As Cisco's fortunes soared in the late 1990s, two professors at Stanford Business School, Charles O'Reilly III and Jeffrey Pfeffer, were at work on a book, Hidden Value: How Great Companies Achieve
Extraordinary Results with Ordinary People. They included a chapter about Cisco, in their view an exemplar when it came to managing people. The authors spent a few pages recounting Cisco's history
and discussing its strategy, and offered a standard profile of John Chambers, the humble supersalesman with the West Virginia drawl. They referred to Cisco's management of acquisitions and noted
its ability to retain talent. Yet none of these seemed adequate to explain Cisco's phenomenal success. “So the question remains,” wrote O'Reilly and Pfeffer, “What accounts for Cisco's competitive ad-

vantage?” And the answer? “Think about it deductively,” they urged. If Cisco was more successful than other companies, that must mean it “has been more adept than its competitors at providing cus-

Preface (2014)

Inthe years since The Halo Effect was first published, a great many things have changed. Even so, the subject of this book—the delusions and errors that pervade the business world and that lead us to

misunderstand the nature of company performance—is as timely as ever. Maybe more so.

As John Kay observed in the Financial Times: “The power of the halo effect means that when things are going well praise spills over to every aspect of performance, but also that when the wheel of
fortune spins, the reappraisal is equally extensive. Our search for excessively simple explanations, our desire to find great men and excellent companies, gets in the way of the complex truth.”

The Halo Effect was well-received by managers in a wide number of fields, ranging from value investing to safety engineering, from lean manufacturing to risk analysis, and from auditing to pharma-
ceutical research. What do these fields have in common? In every one, there’s a need to draw sound conclusions from valid data. It was also appreciated by academics, who used it to help students think
critically about company performance and to conduct sound research.

Iwas gratified that The Halo Effect also struck a chord with readers in many countries. Although my examples were mostly American, the ideas resonated around the world. Three countries deserve
special mention: the United Kingdom, China, and India.

For the UK edition, I was asked to find evidence of the Halo Effect among British companies. I didn’t have to look far. In 2005, Marks & Spencer, Britian’s most famous retailer, ranked a mediocre 127th
out of 220 companies in a survey of most admired British companies conducted by Management Today. But then, as CEO Stuart Rose's strategy took hold, performance began to improve. By 2007, Marks
& Spencer was in first place, lauded as Britain’s Most Admired Company. Not only did it receive the highest score overall, Marks & Sparks (as the British call it) was rated best in five out of nine categories:
quality of goods and services, quality of marketing, use of corporate assets, value as a long-term investment, and ability to attract, develop, and retain talent. It also ranked among the top three on each
of the remaining four categories: quality of management (second), financial soundness (second), community and environmental responsibility (second), and capacity to innovate (third). In not one of
Management Today's nine categories did it finish out of the top three.

Can it be that Marks & Spencer ranked near the top in every one of nine different categories? It seems too good to be true—and sadly, it is. Marks & Spencer's success in the Management Today survey
is a good example of the central phenomenon described in these pages. When it posted strong sales and profits, Marks & Spencer enjoyed a Halo whose aura extended to just about everything it did.
Impressed by its strong performance, observers inferred that Marks & Spencer must be innovative, that it must have great management, that its marketing must be brilliant, and so on. For all the claims
of rigorous research, and for all the thousands of managers that it surveyed, Management Today relied on no objective measures of these categories. It only asked for perceptions, which almost inevitably

are strongly shaped by financial performance.

tomers with the technology and equipment they want.” And that meant two things: Cisco had “the strong belief in having no technology religion, and listening carefully to the customer.” According to
O'Reilly and Pfeffer, that’s what Cisco really did well—it had no technology of its own but listened intently to customers. It observed where the market was going, then acquired the necessary technology

and retained the people who developed it. In the last analysis, the key to Cisco's success had everything to do with its ability to tap the talent and energy of its workforce.

Cisco at Flood Tide

The NASDAQ surged in the last month of 1999, and after a short pause following the New Year, it zoomed past 4000 and then touched 5000. On March 27, 2000, Cisco reached a market cap of $555
billion and eclipsed Microsoft as the most valuable company in the world. In April the NASDAQ began to waver, and by May Cisco's shares had slid by 20 percent from its high of $80. Today we see that
as the first shudder before the house of cards collapsed, but at the time many observers saw a softening in tech stocks only as a much-needed correction, a pause before going still higher. In fact, some
believed that Cisco's stock looked more attractive than ever. In May 2000, Fortune ran a cover story on Cisco and its chief executive. The cover headline asked: “Is John Chambers the world’s best CEO? Is
it too late to buy his stock?” Inside was a six-page article with photos and graphs, based on extensive interviews and visits on-site (including a fawning visit to the home vineyard of a couple of top exec-
utives). Fortune wrote that “Cisco, with CEO John Chambers at the helm, must be considered one of America’s truly outstanding companies, in the same league as Intel, Wal-Mart, and yes, GE.” It was as
positive a story as one can imagine, a high-water mark of hype.

The reasons that Fortune gave for Cisco's amazing success? The same basic themes were stressed yet again. Cisco was credited with “extreme customer focus.” “Put simply,” wrote Fortune, “no
networker has ever had the laser focus on customers that Cisco has had from day one.” It quoted a venture capitalist, John Doerr, who agreed: “That's the focus—customers. John Chambers is the most
customer-focused human being you will ever meet.” Chambers himself commented: “When it comes to our customers, we will do whatever it takes to win them.” A second theme was acquisition in-
tegration. Fortune wrote that Cisco was “making a science of acquisitions,” noting its “ability to integrate acquired companies is legendary.” Third was Cisco's special corporate culture, which blended
personal empowerment with discipline. “You have to understand,” said a rival Silicon Valley executive, “managers are empowered there in a way they just aren't at Oracle or Sun or HP or Intel.” Yet Cisco
was also credited with a culture of discipline and an obsession about costs: “John and [CFO] Larry Carter run such a tight ship, it’s almost unbelievable,” said one manager. Cisco's offices were simple and
frugal. Everyone flew coach. No one, least of all top managers, enjoyed ostentatious perks. Fourth, but by no means last, was John Chambers. Much of the credit for Cisco's success went to Cisco's chief ex-
ecutive. Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com might have been Time magazine's 1999 Person of the Year, but according to Fortune, the best CEO in the information age was John Chambers.

As for holding Cisco's stock, Fortune pointed out that Cisco's growth was twice that of GE’s annual rate of 15 percent. If you owned stock in just one company, wrote Fortune in May 2000, then Cisco
was the one to have. And for a time, that advice seemed justified. The NASDAQ stabilized during the summer of 2000, and by October, when Fortune announced its annual poll of most admired compa-
nies, Cisco was ranked at number two, right behind General Electric—the most successful diversified company in the world, led by the legendary Jack Welch. So there it was. Cisco was at the summit,
immensely successful, wonderfully customer oriented, with a terrific culture and an unsurpassed mastery of acquisitions. The only question, as Fortune had phrased it in May 2000, was whether it was
too late to buy Cisco's stock.

The answer turned out to be yes.


=== 21.png ===
Reversal at Fortune

Tech stocks started to slide in September, then fell faster in October. By November, Cisco's shares were trading at just $50 amid a full rout. The implications for Cisco weren't lost on the more astute

reporters. Scott Thurm of The Wall Street Journal noted: “At stake are tens of billions of dollars of Cisco's stock market value, now $393 billion. And because Cisco relies on its stock to hire and retain
employees, as well as to acquire promising technology, a weaker stock could further hamper Cisco's business. As the stock stagnated in recent months, Cisco's attrition rate inched higher, as some em-
ployees sought more lucrative opportunities.” By the end of 2000, Cisco's share price had dropped all the way to $38, less than half of its record high. Yet John Chambers remained bullish, announcing
that the slump was an opportunity to expand market share, and he continued to order more inventory. But this time things were different. Orders fell, backlog dropped, and in April 2001, Cisco wrote off
a staggering $2. 2 billion of inventory, finally recognizing that it had utterly misread customer demand. Then Chambers was forced to do what he had most dreaded, a layoff of thousands of employees.
By April 2001, exactly one year after peaking at $80, Cisco's stock bottomed out at $14. More than $400 billion in market capitalization had vanished in twelve months. Acquisitions weren't just out of

the question, they were pointless.

In May 2001, exactly one year after its last and greatest puff piece, Fortune ran a very different story about Cisco. The title: “Cisco Fractures Its Own Fairy Tale.” Now it wrote:

On the way up toa stock market value of half a trillion dollars, everything about Cisco seemed perfect. It had a perfect CEO. It could close its books in a day and make perfect financial forecasts. It was an
acquisition machine, ingesting companies and their technologies with great aplomb. It was the leader of the new economy, selling gear to new-world telecom companies that would use it to supplant
old-world carriers and make their old-world suppliers irrelevant.

Over the past year, every one of those characterizations has proved to be false

According to Fortune, Cisco's prowess hadn't just been exaggerated, it had been false. And its problems weren't just external—a bubble bursting and orders slowing down faster than anyone could
have forecast. Rather, Fortune concluded, based on “dozens of conversations with customers, past and present Cisco executives, competitors, and suppliers reveal, Cisco made its own mess.”

What about its extreme customer focus? Now Fortune reported that Cisco “had exhibited a cavalier attitude toward potential customers.” Cisco's sales techniques had been “irksome” and had “alien-
ated” competitors. Its legendary forecasting ability? Sorry. Cisco “had signed long-term contracts with suppliers at just the wrong time.” Its skills at innovation? Now it turned out that “a few of its
products weren't very good.” Nothing was spared: “Acquisitions, forecasting, technology, and, yes, senior management—all have failed Cisco in the past year.” And what had led to such mistakes? At the
heart of these problems was an arrogance brought on by success. Fortune remarked that Cisco had been “basking in a culture of confidence,” that its venture into telecom products was evidence of Cisco's

‘hat it “strode cocksure,” and that its “assuredness bordered on the naive.” Pride before the fall, a theme as old as the Greeks. Other companies had stumbled, sure, but “Cisco’s stumbles are

“swagger,”
fascinating because Chambers promoted the company as a new breed of behemoth—one that was faster, smarter, and just plain better than the competition.” Of course, all of this was even more intrigu-
ing because it wasn’t Chambers who had made these claims, but the journalist's colleagues at Fortune.

Business Week wasn't far behind in shifting its story. In August 2001, in an article titled “Management Lessons from the Bust,” it wrote:


=== 22.png ===
Only a year ago, Cisco Systems Inc. was widely hailed as the shining exemplar of the New Economy. Management gurus viewed Cisco as the prototype of the 21st century organization where informa-
tion technology linked suppliers and customers in ways that allowed the company to nimbly respond to every market nuance.

Cisco had flattened the corporate pyramid, outsourced capital-intensive manufacturing, and forged strategic alliances with suppliers that were supposed to eliminate inventory almost entirely.
Sophisticated information systems gave its managers real-time data, allowing them to detect the slightest change in current market conditions and to forecast with precision. If anyone had “the vision
thing” nailed for the new digital era, it was supposed to be Cisco CEO John T. Chambers.

ops! The surprising abruptness and severity of Cisco's downturn—marked by a shocking $2.2 billion write-off of inventory in April—showed that it was just as vulnerable as any other com-

pany to an economic slowdown.

The same magazines that had rushed to applaud Cisco just a year before—King of the Internet, World’s Best CEO, on par with General Electric and Microsoft—now elbowed one another aside to heap crit-

icism. In January 2002, Business Week published another exposé, this one called “Cisco Behind the Hype.” It wrote:

There has always been a good deal of myth-making where Cisco is concerned. At the height of the Internet frenzy, it was the very embodiment of the age. When it came to Cisco, everything seemed
faster, bigger, and better. Its sales and earnings were second to none. It sold more sophisticated gear over the Internet than any other company as it raced to fill demand that seemed unquenchable. It
could close its books in a day, thanks to its powerful information systems. For 43 quarters in a row, Cisco met or beat Wall Street's hungry expectations for higher earnings. For one brief, heady moment,

it became the most valuable corporation on the planet.

Allthe major themes were addressed: Cisco's customer focus, its culture, its ability to manage acquisitions, and its leadership. But now the company was found lacking in every department. Of course,
it’s possible that Cisco had changed. Success can engender complacency. Rapid growth can lead to difficulties in maintaining control. Some companies do take their customers for granted. And so on.
But that’s not what was being said. No one was saying that Cisco had changed between 2000 and 2001. It was just that now, in retrospect, Cisco was described through a different lens—one of falling

performance.

Springtime for Cisco

But the story of Cisco doesn’t end there. First a thesis, then antithesis, and next synthesis. After summer, a hard winter; and after winter, signs of spring.

For the next two years, 2001 through 2003, while the tech sector remained in the dumps, John Chambers and his colleagues persevered, insisting that Cisco would emerge from the slump stronger
than ever. Recovery came slowly, but by 2003 there were distinct signs of an upturn in the high-tech industry and Cisco began to rack up stronger figures. In November 2003, with sales now on the
mend, Business Week again put Chambers on its cover, this time with the caption “Cisco's Comeback.” The story line was fascinating, not so much for what it said Cisco was doing right in 2003, but for its
account of all the things Cisco was said to have done wrong in 2000.

Once Cisco had been lauded for organizational excellence, for its discipline and coordination. Now Business Week reported that, in fact, Cisco had been out of control. It had a “Wild West culture” that

used to “operate like a band of independent tech tribes. Each unit could choose its own suppliers and manufacturers.” Cisco had been “known for its carpe diem culture—with little coordinated plan-


=== 23.png ===
ning.” Instead, “engineers followed their geek muses wherever they led.” The company was characterized by “chaos that comes with growth at any cost” and “staffers were too busy taking orders and
cashing stock options to bother with efficiency, cost-cutting, or teamwork.” Its many engineering efforts “were a jumble of overlapping development projects.” This portrait of a chaotic and disorganized
company was nothing like the ones we had read in 2000, but never mind, because all of those problems were in the past and now, in 2003, Cisco was “more disciplined and cohesive.” We ought to be re-
lieved at Cisco's improvements—at least until we remember that discipline and cohesion were the very sorts of words used to describe Cisco from 1997 through 2000!

What about customers? Stanford professors O'Reilly and Pfeffer had observed that listening closely to customers was a chief reason for Cisco’s success, and Fortune had described customer focus as
first among Cisco's strengths. Now Business Week wrote that even at the peak of its success, in 2000, Cisco had overlooked its customers. Chambers himself said that maybe Cisco had forgotten one of its

cardinal rules: Listen to your customer. Well, then, what about acquisitions, cited time and again as a key reason for Cisco's success? Sorry, said Business Week, Cisco really hadn't been good at acquisitions

after all: “Cisco had long been a binge buyer—of even unproven start-ups with no profits.” Rather than following a clear strategy, Cisco was said to have embarked on a “73-company buying binge from
1993 to 2000 by scooping up any networking outfit with a shot at success.” It had been on an “acquisition free-for-all” characterized by “haphazard” and “freewheeling investment practices.” These
accounts spared nothing. Where Cisco had once been described as a focused, disciplined company, making a science out of merger integration, it was now remembered as a binge buyer. As for buying
“unproven start-ups with no profits”—well, at the time that had been the whole point, finding young companies with smart people and great ideas. But in retrospect, it was fodder for blame.

Read in the context of their times, each of these articles seems plausible. They offer a reasonable explanation of events. But look at them over the course of a few years, and we have to question whether
the reporters got the story right—or if their descriptions were colored by the story they wanted to tell. Facts were assembled and shaped to tell the story of the moment, whether it was about great per-
formance or collapsing performance or about rebirth and recovery. Placing these accounts together, the impression is nothing short of Orwellian—a rewriting of history that thrusts facts into the past,

rearranging the record to tell a more coherent story. It’s an example of reinterpreting the past to suit present needs.

Intrigued at these sharply different accounts, I contacted the author of one of the most effusive articles, Fortune’s laudatory May 2000 piece. What, I asked Andy Serwer, Fortune’s editor-at-large, could

explain the adulation in 2000 and the extreme criticism later? Serwer candidly replied: “I think there is a pendulum effect, and that we all may get too caught up and perhaps overaccentuate what's
going on.” also contacted Peter Burrows of Business Week, author of the November 2003 article “Cisco's Comeback,” which had portrayed Cisco, three years prior, in 2000, as full of problems. Burrows is
a smart and experienced Silicon Valley journalist who has written extensively about Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, and other companies in the region. What was going on? I asked. Burrows explained that in
his view, Cisco had never really been a cost-conscious company, but that it had been customer focused. He then added: “Generally speaking, I think there's a tendency to exaggerate a company’s strengths
during boom times—never more than during the biggest boom of them all, in the late 1990s.”

No doubt Serwer and Burrows are correct. There's a natural tendency, even at leading publications like Fortune and Business Week, to exaggerate the highs and lows, and to rely on simple phrases to
explain a company’s performance. It makes for a better story, yet it leads us down a dangerous path. It’s often said that journalism is the first draft of history, and these journalistic accounts become the
primary sources for later studies. The Harvard case study mentioned previously, for example, was based on these same newspaper and magazine articles, and the chapter about Cisco in O'Reilly and Pf-
effer’s Hidden Value also cited these same Fortune articles reviewed earlier. These case studies and book chapters are only as good as the sources on which they're based.

But there's an even deeper problem. The story of Cisco is perhaps less an example of intentional journalistic hyperbole than it is of something more basic: the difficulty we have in understanding com-
pany performance, even as it unfolds before us. For all the attention that Cisco received, for all its prominence in the press over several years, even experienced journalists and respected academics had

trouble identifying with any precision the reasons for Cisco’s outstanding success or its stunning decline. There was talk, over and over, about customer orientation and leadership and organizational


=== 24.png ===
efficiency, but these things are hard to measure objectively, so we tend to make attributions about them based on things we do feel certain about—revenues and profits and share price. We may not really

know what leads to high performance, so we reach for simple phrases to make sense of what happened.

CHAPTER THREE

Up and Down with ABB

Milo went pale again. “He did what?”
“He mashed hundreds of cakes of GI soap into the sweet potatoes just to show that people have the taste of Philistines and don’t know the difference between good and bad. Every man in the
squadron was sick. Missions were canceled.”
“Well!” Milo exclaimed with thin-lipped disapproval. “He certainly found out how wrong he was, didn’t he?”

“On the contrary,” Yossarian corrected. “He found out how right he was. We packed it away by the plateful and clamored for more. We all knew we were sick, but had no idea we'd been

poisoned.”
Joseph Heller

Catch-22, 1961

It might not be surprising to find a strong bandwagon effect in the story of Cisco. The business world seemed to lose touch with reality during the high-tech bubble of the late 1990s. Maybe we can for-
give a few journalists for losing their sense of perspective. But the same thing can be seen at other companies, including some that are neither new, high-tech, nor American.

Consider ABB, the Swedish-Swiss industrial company. ABB was created in 1988 by the merger of two leading engineering companies, Sweden's ASEA and Switzerland’s Brown Boveri. The fusion was
the brainchild of ASEA’s chief executive, Percy Barnevik, who saw that national power markets were giving way and reasoned that a company that operated across borders could have a big competitive
advantage. The newly combined company was a leader in power generation, transmission, and distribution, as well as a few other businesses including process automation, robotics, and plastics.

Barnevik quickly set about blending the two companies into one. The speed of integration was breathtaking, the cost savings unprecedented. A number of plants were closed across Europe, jobs were
cut, and overhead was slashed. At the same time, ABB expanded its global position through a series of acquisitions. In 1989, it made headlines by paying $700 million for Westinghouse Electric’s North
American power transmission and distribution business, and then bought U.S.-based Combustion Engineering for $1.6 billion. Next, ABB expanded into Central and Eastern Europe, taking advantage
of liberalization and privatization after the fall of Communism. It also moved into Asian markets, where demand for power and engineering was growing rapidly. By 1994, ABB's profile had been com-
pletely transformed, with reduced head count in Western Europe, consolidation in North America, and expansion into emerging markets. All the while, sales and profits were up. Between 1988 and

1996, ABB's revenues almost doubled to $34.7 billion, and profit tripled to $1.2 billion. Its share price grew rapidly, and ABB's market capitalization surpassed $40 billion.


=== 26.png ===
Explaining ABB’s Success

For roughly a decade, from the late 1980s through the late 1990s, the business press was full of stories about ABB. What could account for ABB's breathtaking success? Most explanations started at
the top, with ABB's chief executive. Tall, lean, with sharp eyes and a neatly trimmed goatee, Percy Barnevik cut a striking figure. He was unprecedented for a European business leader—a Scandinavian
who combined old world manners and language skills with American pragmatism and an orientation for action. It was a memorable combination. The American press was impressed with Barnevik’s
Stanford MBA and his command of American slang. Soon, feature articles began to appear in leading magazines. A 1991 profile in Harvard Business Review described Barnevik as a “corporate pioneer”
who was building “the new model of competitive enterprise.” He was said to believe in rapid decision making and relentless communication, and was committed to building a set of values that would

hold together his vast company. In 1992, Long Range Planning described ABB as a “model merger for a new Europe” and was forthright in its praise for the leader: “By any standards, Barnevik is one of Eu-

is to become immediately aware of an incisive, original approach to management in which the ability to make swift, confident decisions is paramount.” Fortune

rope's world-class CEOs. To meet him...
gushed: “If lean and mean could be personified, Percy Barnevik would walk through the door. . .. Barnevik is Europe's leading hatchet man. He is also the creator of what is fast becoming the most suc-
cessful cross-border merger since Royal Dutch linked up with Shell in 1907.”

More flattering stories followed. In 1993, Business Week ran a feature story titled “Percy Barnevik’s Global Crusade.” It began: “Call it Planet Barnevik. The hard charging executive of ABB has seen the
future and it contains no national boundaries.” Over the next pages, Business Week painted a vivid portrait. “Despite a manic drive and a fast-track career, Barnevik is—for a European business chief—
surprisingly unpretentious and accessible.” Barnevik “meets frequently with all levels of ABB management, from button-down directors at Zurich headquarters to shirtsleeved supervisors on the floor
of a turbine factory in Poland—most of whom call him by his first name.” He was a workaholic who was known to do “paperwork in the sauna.” Barnevik was also “renowned for his speed-reading ability
and sharp analytical skills” and “never bothers to prepare speeches in advance, preferring to speak extemporaneously on even such dense topics as international economic adjustments.” To complete
the picture, away from work Barnevik was said to climb mountains and “enjoys up to 10-hour marathon jogging sessions, pausing only for short breaks.” A year later, Forbes wrote that “Bamnevik rel-
ishes taking a scythe to bureaucratic bloat.” He was “a commanding figure who speaks in a slow, rich baritone. But by no means is he the European-style imperial CEO. He is unpretentious and candid,
punching the air with his fist, coloring our chat with the occasional American profanity.” Industry Week wrote that Barnevik had “a prodigious store of personal energy, a boundless grasp of business op-
erations, and the clear determination to enhance his company’s competitive mark in industry.” He was “remarkably fresh, dynamic, and engaging.”

Academics joined the chorus of praise. One of Europe's best-known professors of management, Manfred Kets de Vries of INSEAD, confirmed that Barnevik was, as widely reported, aman ina hurry,
“but what was also noticeable was his humility. He continually played down his own contribution to the success of ABB.” Over the next years, Barnevik’s reputation continued to grow. In 1996, Director
repeated stories about Barnevik’s prodigious personal qualities: “Famously workaholic and incessantly on the move, he sometimes jokes he spends two days a week in the office—Saturday and Sun-

day. ... Colleagues speak in awe of his ability to go deeply into the details of a business without getting bogged down, of being able to work 20-hour days across time zones, catnapping at will, and of

keeping in touch by phone and fax on his midsummer's sailing holiday. He has even been seen doing paperwork in the sauna.” Whether Barnevik’s sauna habits were observed directly, or whether the

observation of one reporter in 1993 was recycled by another three years later wasn’t clear—but it really didn’t matter. By now, Barnevik had assumed legendary status. For four consecutive years in the


=== 27.png ===
mid-1990s, he was voted “CEO/chairman of Europe's most respected company.” He was called Europe's Jack Welch. Barnevik’s reputation had gained a momentum of its own: In 1996, the Korean Man-
agement Association named him “the world’s best honored top manager.” Barnevik was now getting awards for receiving the most awards!

‘ABB's chief executive wasn’t the only explanation for its success. Linked to Barnevik was a second theme: a dynamic corporate culture. ABB had neither a staid Swedish culture, emphasizing consen-
sus and participation, nor a conservative Swiss culture, but was depicted as a confident blur of speed and action. Its very creation had been a bold move, aimed at creating a world-class company from
two venerable European firms. Shortly after the merger, in a speech to top managers in Cannes, Barnevik described ABB's modus operandi in three principles: “1. To take action (and stick one’s neck out)
and do the right things is obviously the best behavior; 2. To take action and do the wrong things is next best (within reason and a limited number of times); 3. Not to take action (and lose opportunities)

is the only unacceptable behavior.” In a separate interview with the Financial Times, he elaborated: “If you do 50 things, it is enough if 35 go in the right direction. A basic rule is: ‘Take the initiative and

do the right things’ The next message is: ‘Take the initiative even if it subsequently leads to the wrong things.’ The only thing we cannot accept is people who do nothing.” This ethos—action, initiative,
risk taking—was said to characterize the ABB culture and was frequently mentioned as a prime reason for the company’s growth and success.

A third theme in stories about ABB was its complex organization design. All multinational companies have to take advantage of their global scale while also competing in local markets. For ABB, the
challenge was to capture benefits of global efficiency in an industry where many customers were state-owned power companies, not global firms. Barnevik described the paradox: ABB had a simultane-

ous need to be “global and local, big and small, and radically decentralized with central reporting and control.” All of this called for a new way to organize and manage. Barnevik never referred to ABB as

a “global” company, preferring to describe it as a “federation of national companies.” The goal was to find the best solutions to customers’ problems and then spread them throughout the world. It was
to unleash the energy of local entrepreneurs by “ripping down bureaucracy so executives in Atlanta can launch new products without meddling from headquarters, so power technicians in Sweden can
make design changes, and so factories in India can alter production methods on their own.”

To meet both global and local objectives, ABB devised a matrix structure with seven major sectors divided into business areas on one axis and dozens of countries on the other axis. While other multi-
nationals were moving away from the complexity of matrix management, ABB embraced it explicitly. ABB's matrix had fifty-one business areas and forty-one country managers, which intersected in
1,300 separate companies. These companies were divided into 5,000 profit centers, each one accountable to deliver profits and empowered to achieve high performance. Such a complex organization—
5,000 separate profit centers!—naturally invited questions. Industry Week speculated that “just trying to figure out who has responsibility for what would seem to impede interpersonal communications
and make more difficult the maintenance of a sharp customer focus.” But when reporters spoke with ABB's managers, their concerns fell away. Managers seemed satisfied, and of course the company’s
results spoke for themselves—so the organization must have been good. Business Week told the story of a Swiss factory manager who remembered his days at Brown Boveri, when he had no autonomy
and little accountability. ABB's new organization put him in charge of a profit center, a wonderfully motivating change that led to substantial improvements as he borrowed ideas from a similar ABB
plant in Sweden. Improvements weren't long in coming, and profits soon took off.

ABB's sophisticated organization was applauded by journalists, academics, and management gurus. Tom Peters, perhaps the world’s best-known guru in the early 1990s, called ABB a “buckyball
organization,” referring to the elegant geodesic structures designed by Buckminster Fuller. According to Peters, Percy Barnevik was the most insistent enemy of bureaucracy that he had ever met. He
wrote that Barnevik’s “abiding hatred of bureaucracy is critical to making the ABB structure work.” Christopher Bartlett at Harvard Business School wrote a case study that described not just ABB’s
organization structure, but also explained the sophisticated processes and management philosophy that made it work so well. Manfred Kets de Vries held up ABB's organization as a model for others to
emulate. Despite its giant size and scope, ABB was said to have the agility and flexibility of a small company. According to Kets de Vries, ABB had invented a new organizational form; it exemplified the

“prototypical postindustrial organization.”

ABB on Mount Olympus

By the mid-1990s, ABB was atop the world, consistently named among the world’s most-admired and best-managed companies. In 1996, ABB was named Europe’s Most Respected Company for the third

year in a row by the Financial Times. The accompanying article explained:

‘As well as being the overall winner, [ABB] is rated exceptionally highly for business performance, corporate strategy and maximizing employee potential. It is also cited most frequently as the bench-

mark against which other companies measure their performance.

Indeed, admiration for ABB's achievements is overshadowed only by esteem for Mr. Percy Barnevik, its president. Named Europe's most respected business leader, he attracted more votes than were cast

for his company in the overall rankings: he was particularly praised for strategic vision and focus.

Even normally skeptical observers applauded ABB and its leader. In 1996, John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge of The Economist wrote a stinging book, The Witch Doctors, which took aim at man-

agement gurus. Yet they set aside their skepticism when it came to ABB. Micklethwait and Wooldridge commented:

Europe has produced worryingly few management superstars. But one man who unquestioningly fits the bill is Percy Barnevik. .. A tall, fast-talking Swede, with the restless manner of aman overen-

dowed with energy, Barnevik has won almost every honour which his profession can bestow, from “emerging markets CEO of the year” to (twice) boss of Europe's most respected company.

Was the admiration of Barnevik excessive? Not at all, said Micklethwait and Wooldridge. “For once,” they continued, “the hyperbole is largely warranted.” They went on to praise Barnevik for his com-
manding presence, his bold strategic vision, his no-nonsense style, and ABB's nimble organization, repeating the broad themes of the previous several years.

In January 1997, after more than a dozen years at the helm of ASEA and then ABB, Percy Barnevik turned over responsibilities as chief executive to Goran Lindahl, executive vice president of power
transmission, but he remained non-executive chairman. The transition was smooth, and ABB's performance remained strong. The company was featured in a Financial Times series called Mastering
Management, written by two researchers at the Ashridge Management Centre in England, Kevin Barham and Claudia Heimer. Noting that ABB had enjoyed spectacular financial success, the authors
praised it as a “new form of global organization.” They attributed ABB's success to “five guiding lights”: customer focus, connectivity, communication, collegiality, and convergence. The following year,
1998, Barham and Heimer published a full-length book, ABB: The Dancing Giant. Based on dozens of articles and case studies as well as original interviews with ABB managers, their 382-page book was
the culmination of a decade of praise. Barham and Heimer called Barnevik “the most influential manager in the world.” They described ABB's organization structure and admired its high levels of em-
ployee empowerment. They likened ABB managers to “a new breed of superhumans.” They concluded that ABB occupied a position on the “Corporate Mount Olympus” with General Electric and Micro-

soft. There wasn't a trace of irony in their words—and why should there have been? By this time, ABB had racked up a solid decade of strong financial results. Its success seemed clear to all.

Running Off the Rails: ABB After 1997

Yet even as Barham and Heimer’s book arrived in stores, ABB’s fortunes were beginning to shift. Lindahl and Barnevik had begun to steer ABB away from its reliance on heavy manufacturing and
engineering, and toward a new mix of activities including services. At a time when management thinking was shaped by concepts such as “intellectual capital” and “intangible assets,” ABB's leaders
said they wanted it to become a “knowledge-based” company. Barnevik explained that “ABB is transforming its business portfolio, expanding into higher value businesses based on intellectual capital,
focused on software, intelligent products, and complete service solutions. It’s a strategy with significant advantages.” He described “ABB's transformation to a knowledge company,” which involved
“moving up the value chain, delivering in effect greater competitiveness rather than products and services. ABB will also reduce its exposure to some of the cyclic swings to which it has been vulnerable
in the past.”

Accordingly, ABB resumed making acquisitions, but this time entering into new areas, including financial services. It also began to divest itself of some formerly core activities. ABB sold its 50 percent
share of the Adtranz joint venture with Daimler Chrysler for $472 million, exiting the trains and trams business altogether. ABB sold its nuclear fuels business and combined its power generation
business with Alsthom of France to create a fifty-fifty joint venture, ABB Alsthom Power. How did the public react to this fundamental shift? Did anyone worry that ABB was straying from its core? Not
at all. ABB's new direction was met with approval. For starters, ABB's reputation was so strong that few observers doubted openly what the company could achieve. Furthermore, its strategy resembled
the earlier migration of General Electric, which had shifted successfully from manufacturing to financial services. Meanwhile, ABB's share price continued to rise—nothing like Cisco, of course, but at
a healthy rate, along with many other companies in those bull market years. But ABB's reputation wasn’t based only on its share price—it was known as a bold company that had transformed a pair of
stodgy industrial companies into a New Age dynamo. Admiration from peers continued, and ABB's glow now reflected on its new chief executive. In November 1999, Goran Lindahl was named CEO of
the Year by the American publication Industry Week, becoming the first European to receive the award, joining previous winners including Jack Welch, Lou Gerstner, Michael Dell, and Bill Gates. Industry
Week cited Lindahl for his strategic leadership, noting with approval ABB's acquisitions into new markets and its divestiture of mature businesses.

The early evidence seemed to confirm the wisdom of ABB's strategy. Revenues continued to rise, and the mid-2000 share price reached an all-time high of $31. A business school case study talked
about ABB's transformation as if it were already a success: “The results of these initiatives were clearly visible as ABB entered the new millennium. In early 2000, the company reported a 24% increase in
net income to $1.6 billion, and a 4% increase in revenues to $24.7 billion in 1999. Company analysts unanimously regarded the company’s prospects as outstanding. ‘ABB is no longer a cost story. It is a
growth story, one such analyst observed.”

In ABB: The Dancing Giant, Barham and Heimer predicted that the years after 1996 would be ones of “reaping the harvest.” ABB had planted its garden, now it would enjoy the fruits. Brimming with
optimism about the company’s future success, the book ended by declaring: “We look forward to finding out about the next big surprise coming out of Zurich!”

The next years were indeed full of surprises, but not the ones anyone expected. Signs of trouble began to build in 2000, as revenue growth slowed. In November 2000, Goran Lindahl abruptly
announced his resignation, taking almost everyone by surprise. The reason he gave: To turn the reins over to someone with stronger IT capabilities, critical given ABB's shift into knowledge-intensive

businesses. Lindahl was replaced in January 2001 by Jiirgen Centerman, who soon announced a shift in ABB's famous organization structure. From now on, ABB would be designed around industries

Not surprisingly, when Marks & Spencer's performance faltered the next year, it quickly fell out of the top tier on almost every one of these same measures. Without objective measures and valid data,
the survey turns out to be little more than a feel-good story masquerading as scientific research. Of course, most readers are impressed by large sample size and apparently precise statistics—Marks &
Spencer’s winning score was 76.33, calculated to two decimal points—and can’t spot what's wrong. They're taken in by what I call the Delusion of Rigorous Research—the fifth delusion described in
these pages. Wise readers should not be fooled. They should be aware that a study like this may ask about nine categories, but in reality taps one basic perception, which it then expresses nine different
-ways—an entirely different matter!

Acontinent away, in China, the Halo Effect is also thriving. One of my Chinese colleagues regaled me with stories of huge praise that was heaped upon successful companies during years of meteoric
growth, only to be followed with merciless fury when the performance of those companies faltered. Reputations were exaggerated on the upside and then destroyed with equal passion.

The most illuminating response to The Halo Effect came from India, where I was contacted by ICICI Bank, the county’s largest private bank. ICICI Bank had grown tremendously over the previous
decade, leading to many complimentary articles in the business press. Journalists in India, like their cousins the world over, were quick to lavish praise. A few of the bank’s executives had the good sense
to be concerned. As one of them explained to me: “We don’t mind if others put a halo on us, but we never want to be fooled by our success. We need to understand what drives our success, and strive to do
better.” ICICI’s leaders wanted to focus on the real drivers of performance for a financial institution and not merely infer that they were doing well at execution or customer service just because the over-
all results were strong. They didn’t want to be taken in by the Halo of their own success.

The story doesn’t end there. In 2009, after the banking industry suffered a sharp downturn, the largest Indian banks—including ICICI Bank—came in for criticism. As company executives widely un-
derstood, it had been important not to be taken in by excessive praise during good times, and now it was equally vital not to take criticism to heart when times were bad. For all the tumult and anguish in
capital markets, and for all the fickle responses by investors, ICICI Bank’s fundamental business model remained sound. Once again, observers were quick to make extreme attributions based on current
performance, whether favorable or unfavorable. As Warren Buffett observed about investors, there’s a tendency to overshoot in both directions, on the high side and also on the low side.

Iwas impressed by the clear thinking of executives at ICICI Bank, and I have been equally gratified by the attitudes of managers in many other companies. | admire their desire to understand the real
drivers of performance, rather than be fooled by a mirage.

‘Yet there's a long way to go. Much of what we continue to read and hear in the business world is riddled with errors. There are frequent examples of the Halo Effect in the business press, in academic
research, in studies conducted by leading consultancies, as well as in new business books published every year. For all their claims of rigorous research, for all their pretensions of science, the variables
they draw upon are often not independent of the thing they are seeking to explain.

Indeed, since The Halo Effect was published, several more books appeared that claim to reveal the secrets of high performance. One looked at startups—a sort of Good to Great for the entrepreneurial
set. Another examined European companies, a replication of Built to Last for the Old Continent. Another turned the question of high performance on its head, asking what causes successful companies
to fail. The genre is alive and well because the lure of simple solutions remains strong. Most of these books make the same flaw that’s revealed in this book: If you select companies on the basis of out-
comes—whether success or failure—and then gather data that are biased by those outcomes, you'll never know what drives performance. You'll only know how high performers or low performers are
described.

To the original ten chapters—which are unchanged from the 2007 edition—I've added two more.

and customer groups, not products. Explained Centerman, the old structure had up to ten entities dealing with the same customer, causing overlap and confusion. The new design would be simpler and
would help deepen relationships with key clients.

New design or not, ABB's performance continued to slide. In April 2001, it reported a 6 percent decline in annual revenues as market demand softened. Reporters now speculated that worsening
results had been the real reason for Lindahl’s sudden departure. Then unpleasant surprises began to pop up from past acquisitions. In response to Securities & Exchange Commission filing requirements,
ABB disclosed some troubling news: Combustion Engineering, the U.S. firm it had acquired in 1989, was the target of messy asbestos litigation, forcing ABB to set aside $470 million as provisions for
damage claims. These provisions hurt ABB's credit rating and compounded its debt worries. Performance continued to dive through the summer, and by autumn 2001, ABB's share price had fallen by
70 percent from its peak of the previous year. The Wall Street Journal now reported that ABB's “vision to move away from heavy industry toward knowledge driven, high technology fields appeared to go.
awry as profits fell.”

Under growing pressure from the board, Barnevik resigned as ABB's non-executive chairman in November 2001 and was replaced by Jiirgen Dormann, a board member and former chief executive of
the German chemicals group Hoechst. But ABB's performance fell still faster over the next year, and Centerman was replaced as CEO in September 2002. Jiirgen Dormann now took over as chief execu-
tive as well as chairman, and began to review ABB's broad range of businesses. Sensing the extent of ABB's troubles, Dormann quickly reversed the company’s course. He divested ABB’s petrochemicals
division, sold ABB's structured finance division to GE, and secured a $1.5 billion loan so ABB could avoid a liquidity crisis. With the sale of these “non-core” assets, ABB had narrowed its focus and now
defined itself in terms of automation technologies and power technologies.

Amid ABB's steep decline came another shock. In early 2002, the news broke that Barnevik and Lindahl had secured a secret pension deal worth $150 milli

ion. The package had been agreed in 1992
with Peter Wallenberg, ABB's co-chairman and a member of Sweden’s most powerful family, but hadn’t been disclosed to other members of the board, much less to managers throughout the company.
The size of the pension deal was huge since it had been linked to ABB's results, which had been excellent throughout the 1990s. Yet by the time Barnevik and Lindahl stepped down, ABB was no longer a
high performer, and the large payout—unheard of by European standards—set off a huge outcry. Inside and outside the company, in Sweden and throughout Europe, people were shocked by what they
perceived as an example of executive greed. Under intense pressure, Barnevik agreed to return 90 million out of 148 million Swiss francs, and Lindahl returned 47 million of 85 million Swiss francs, but
their reputations were damaged.

In 2002, ABB lost $600 million on flat revenues. Debt had ballooned, and some analysts speculated the company was close to bankruptcy. Market capitalization now was less than $4 billion, barely

one-tenth of its peak of $40 billion. As 2003 began, ABB once again sought to restructure its activities, to cut jobs and sell assets, and it still faced huge liabilities in asbestos lawsuits. Over the next year,
led by Dormann and a new executive team, ABB worked steadily to restore profitability. By summer 2004, revenues were beginning to rise again, and profitability was restored for the first time after a
net loss the previous year. A new CEO, Fred Kindle, took over, and by autumn 2005, ABB was nearing a final settlement regarding asbestos claims and had driven its debt to a manageable level. Operating

profits were modest, and industry demand remained uncertain, but ABB was back in the black.

ABB Through the Looking Glass

There was no absence of stories while ABB was on the way up, and the ink didn’t run dry when it was in free fall, either. When times were good, ABB's culture had been celebrated as bold and daring.


=== 31.png ===
Action had been preferred to lengthy analysis—the willingness to act was a reason for ABB's success. But once growth stalled and U.S. asbestos claims mounted, ABB's ambitious growth strategy was per-
ceived differently. Now ABB was described as having been impulsive and foolish. In 2003, ABB's chairman, Jiirgen Dormann, remembered: “We had a lack of focus as Percy went on an acquisition spree.
The company wasn’t disciplined enough.”

‘As for ABB's New Age organization? As long as times were good, the complex matrix organization had been described as a key to its success, a hypermodern mix of global and local, a flexible buckyball.
Now a different picture emerged. As ABB's performance unraveled, one reporter wrote: “The decentralized management structure Mr. Barnevik created for the company’s far-flung units ended up caus-
ing conflicts and communication problems between departments.” ABB managers, once full of praise for the company’s nimble design, now recalled an organization beset with chaos and conflict. So
many divisions, so many countries, and so many profit centers had resulted in a “vast duplication of effort.” Allowing local decisions had produced a fragmented back office with 576 enterprise resource
planning systems, 60 different payroll systems, and more than 600 spreadsheet software programs used in the company. Sharing data had become a nightmare. Managers also recalled poor coordination
among countries and dysfunctional competition—such as the lack of sharing plans for fear that managers in other countries would poach them. Not exactly the paragon of postindustrial management
we had read about just a few years before! And interestingly, none of these recent articles suggested that ABB's organization had changed in any way—it was the same organization, but now the emphasis
was onits flaws.

Perhaps the most stinging revision was saved for Percy Barnevik. When ABB was posting record performance, Barnevik had been the focus of a virtual personality cult, portrayed with powers of a su-

perman. He had been described as charismatic, bold, and visionary. But once performance fell, Barnevik was remembered as arrogant, imperial, and resistant to criticism. He was said to have “built walls

around himself.” He had been “high-handed in his treatment of the board.” He had “monopolized the flow of information,” quite the opposite of the spirit of openness he claimed to espouse. Barnevik
‘was now accused of having been “addicted to acquisitions” and was nicknamed “Percyfal” after the knight who searched in vain for the Holy Grail. Others said that Barnevik suffered from an unhealthy
fixation with Jack Welch and had been obsessed with matching the size and success of General Electric.

Had Barnevik changed? Perhaps. Manfred Kets de Vries at INSEAD explained that some successful executives “start to believe their own presses and it becomes a vicious circle of narcissism.” Yet no
one offered any evidence of alleged “narcissism.” No one said that Barnevik now gazed at himself admiringly in the reflection of his hot tub, or devoted too much time to personal grooming, or decorated
the walls of his office with his many awards, or otherwise neglected the business of ABB. No one showed how “narcissism” had led to any specific errors, whether strategic or organizational. (Nor did any-
one point out that some of the most favorable press coverage that had supposedly led to narcissism came from Professor Kets de Vries himself.) In fact, looking across fifteen years of articles, Barnevik
was portrayed as very much the same man throughout—bold, direct, and very sure of himself. No one offered any evidence that he had changed—it was all inferred based on the company’s performance.
Winners are confident, losers are arrogant. Fortune observed: “His reputation in tatters, the former ABB chairman faces another unkind cut: His successors are questioning his business legacy.”

Naturally, Percy Barnevik wasn't terribly pleased with the revisionist view of his years at ABB. The Wall Street Journal wrote that Barnevik “bristles at the charges that he helped destroy the company,”
quoting him as saying: “I refuse to accept we were trigger happy.” Being made a scapegoat “has not been much fun.” Regarding asbestos claims at Combustion Engineering, Barnevik maintained it had
been an acceptable risk at the time. “It is a hell of a thing to say you should have seen 13 years ago risks nobody else saw.” Yet the tendency to attribute company success to a specific individual is hard
to resist. In fact, one of the main reasons we love stories is that they don't simply report disconnected facts but make connections about cause and effect, often ascribing credit or blame to individuals.
Our most compelling stories often place people at the center of events. When times are good, we lavish praise and create heroes. When things go bad, we lay blame and create villains. These stories offer
a means of establishing right and wrong, a way of attributing moral responsibility. Of the dozens of articles about ABB, only a few tried to resist this tendency and retain a sense of perspective. In their

2002 Fortune article, Richard Tomlinson and Paola Hjelt wrote: “Barnevik was never as good as the rave reviews he received in the 1990s, nor was he half as bad as the recent damning press coverage


=== 32.png ===
might suggest. What's been missing since open season was declared on Barnevik is a sense of proportion about how much of the blame he should shoulder.” A wise view, but all too rare among the scores
of articles and case studies about ABB. Most writers went with the simpler story. Once widely revered, Percy Barnevik was now an exemplar of arrogance, of greed, of bad leadership. A final postscript

to the saga of ABB came in late 2005, when the Office of the Prosecutor in Zurich dropped its case against Barnevik and Goran Lindahl in connection with their pension deal. Finding no fault with either
manager, the prosecutor noted that the deal had been agreed in 1998, when ABB had been a very profitable company, and had been entirely proper given rules of disclosure. Yet by then the damage had

been done, the perception of villainy set in stone. It was, as Barnevik said, a hell of a thing.

CHAPTER FOUR

Halos All Around Us

The difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves, but how she's treated.

George Bernard Shaw

Pygmalion, 1916

During World War I, an American psychologist named Edward Thorndike was conducting research into the ways that superiors rate their subordinates. In one study, he asked army officers to rate their
soldiers on a variety of features: intelligence, physique, leadership, character, and so on. He was struck by the results. Some men were thought to be “superior soldiers” and were rated highly at just about
everything, while others were thought to be subpar across the board. It was as if officers figured that a soldier who was handsome and had good posture should also be able to shoot straight, polish his
shoes well, and play the harmonica, too. Thorndike called it the Halo Effect.

There are a few kinds of Halo Effect. One refers to what Thorndike observed, a tendency to make inferences about specific traits on the basis of a general impression. It’s difficult for most people to
independently measure separate features; there’s a common tendency to blend them together. The Halo Effect is a way for the mind to create and maintain a coherent and consistent picture, to reduce
cognitive dissonance. Here's a recent example: In the autumn of 2001, after the September 11 attacks, George W. Bush's overall approval rating rose sharply. No surprise there, as the American public
closed ranks behind its president. But the number of Americans who approved of President Bush’s handling of the economy also rose—from 47 percent to 60 percent. Now, whether or not you like Bush’s
economic policies, there’s no reason to believe that his handling of the economy was suddenly better in the weeks after September 11. But it’s hard to keep these things separate: General approval of the
president carried over to approval of a specific policy. The American public conferred a Halo on its president and made favorable attributions across the board. After all, it's uncomfortable for many peo-
ple to believe that their president might be good on issues of national security but ineffective on the economy—it’s far easier to think he’s about the same for both. And what goes up can also come down.
By October 2005, with public support for the Iraq War fading and in the wake of Hurricane Katrina's devastation, President Bush's overall approval rating sank to 37 percent, down from 41 percent in

August 2005. Interestingly, Americans also gave the president lower marks on every specific question in the poll: For his economic policies, Bush had a 32 percent approval rating in October compared


=== 34.png ===
with 37 percent in August; regarding Iraq, 32 percent down from 38 percent; and fighting terrorism, 46 percent versus 54 percent. Asked whether President Bush had strong qualities of leadership, 45
percent of Americans said yes, compared with 54 percent in August. Each of these individual indicators moved in parallel, suggesting they were not independent but rather based on a single, overall as-
sessment—a Halo.

This sort of Halo Effect shows up in many places. One of the companies I work with gets thousands of calls every day to its customer support center. Sometimes the problems can be solved right away,
but often the service representative has to look into the matter and call back later. When the company subsequently surveyed its customers to see how satisfied they had been with the support center,
customers whose problem had been solved right away rated the service representative as more knowledgeable than did customers whose problem had not been solved. That's not surprising, since it’s
reasonable to infer that a quick solution came from a well-informed rep. But here’s what's more intriguing: 58 percent of customers whose problem had been solved right away remembered that their
call had been answered “immediately” or “very quickly,” while only 4 percent remembered having been kept waiting “too long.” Meanwhile, of those customers whose problem had not been solved right
away, only 36 percent remembered their call had been answered “immediately” or “very quickly,” while 18 percent recalled they had waited “too long.” In fact, the company had an automated answering
system and there was no difference in waiting time between the two groups. Rather, an overall impression about customer service created a powerful Halo Effect that shaped perceptions about waiting
time.

But the Halo Effect is not just a way to reduce cognitive dissonance. It’s also a heuristic, a sort of rule of thumb that people use to make guesses about things that are hard to assess directly. We tend
to grasp information that is relevant, tangible, and appears to be objective, and then make attributions about other features that are more vague or ambiguous. For example, we may not know if anew
product is good, but if it comes from a well-known company with an excellent reputation, we might reasonably infer it should be of good quality. That’s what brand building is about: creating Halos so
that consumers are more likely to think favorably of a product or service. Or take a well-documented setting for the Halo Effect—the job interview. What's the most relevant and tangible information we
first have about job candidates? Probably the school where they earned their degree, their grade-point average, and what honors they received. With this information clearly in mind—relevant, tangible,
and seemingly objective—interviewers tend to shade their evaluations about other things that are less tangible, such as a candidate's personal manner or the quality of answers to general questions. A
strong record from an excellent school? The job candidate often appears to be a little brighter, with smarter answers and greater potential for success. A modest record from an unheralded local school?
The very same answers may sound a little less intelligent, the same appearance a bit less impressive. Which is exactly what Thorndike found in his study about army officers and their soldiers all those
years ago.

Now consider companies. What's the most relevant and tangible information we often have about a company? Financial performance, of course. Whether the company is profitable. Whether sales are
growing. Whether the price of its stock is on the rise. Financial performance looks to be accurate and objective. Numbers don't lie, we like to say—which is why Enron, Tyco, and a handful of other recent
scandals shake our confidence so deeply. We routinely trust financial performance figures. And it’s natural that on the basis of this performance data, people make attributions about other things that
are less tangible and objective. All of which helps explain what we saw at Cisco and ABB. As long as Cisco was growing and profitable and setting records for its share price, managers and journalists and
professors inferred that it had a wonderful ability to listen to its customers, a cohesive corporate culture, and a brilliant strategy. And when the bubble burst, observers were quick to make the opposite
attribution. It all made sense. It told a coherent story. Same for ABB, where rising sales and profits led to favorable evaluations of its organization structure, its risk-taking culture, and most clearly the
man at the top—and then to unfavorable evaluations when performance fell. Journalistic hyperbole? To some extent, sure. But more importantly, a natural human tendency to make attributions based

on cues that we think are reliable.


=== 35.png ===
Halos in the Business World

Financial information is far from the only data on which people make attributions. Barry Staw, then at the University of Illinois and later at the University of California, conducted an experiment in
which groups of participants were asked to estimate a company’s future sales and earnings per share based on a set of financial data. Afterward, he told some of the groups they had performed well,
making accurate estimates of sales and earnings per share, and told other groups they had performed poorly—but Staw did so completely at random. In fact, the “high-performing groups” and the “low-
performing groups” had done equally well in their financial calculations; the only difference was what Staw told them about their performance. Then he asked the participants to rate how well their
groups had done ona range of issues. The results? When told they had performed well, people described their groups as having been highly cohesive, with better communication, more openness to
change, and superior motivation. When told they had performed poorly, they recalled a lack of cohesion, poor communication, and low motivation. Staw concluded that people attribute one set of char-
acteristics to groups they believe are effective, and a very different set of characteristics to groups they believe are ineffective. That’s the Halo Effect in action.

Of course, these findings do not mean that group cohesiveness and effective communication are unimportant in group performance. It only means that you can’t hope to measure cohesiveness or
communication or motivation by asking people to rate themselves when they already know something about the outcome. Once people—whether outside observers or participants—believe the out-
come is good, they tend to make positive attributions about the decision process; and when they believe the outcome is poor, they tend to make negative attributions. Why? Because it’s hard to know in
objective terms exactly what constitutes good communication or optimal cohesion or appropriate role clarity, so people tend to make attributions based on other data that they believe are reliable. Per-
formance is a cue by which people attribute characteristics to groups and to organizations.

Some people questioned Staw’s findings. They doubted whether an experiment that put strangers together for just thirty minutes could accurately capture the perceptions of work groups. A team led
by H. Kirk Downey at the University of Oklahoma therefore replicated Staw’s study, using the exact same set of financial problems, but with groups of people who hada prior history of working together,
and giving them considerably more time to make their calculations. Again, groups were told—at random—that they had performed well or poorly. The results were virtually the same as in Staw's exper-
iment. Once again, “high-performing teams” reported that their groups had been more cohesive, that teammates were of high ability and had enjoyed working together, that communication had been
ofa high quality, that they had been open to new ideas, and that overall they had been satisfied with the group process. All because of the randomly assigned description of performance—nothing more.
Like Staw, Downey and his colleagues found a strong tendency to make attributions on the basis of performance.

Surprising? It probably shouldn't be. Picture a group where people express their views vigorously and passionately, even arguing with one another. If the group performs well, participants might
reasonably look back and say that open and forthright expressions of opinion were a key reason for success. They'll say: We were honest, we didn’t hold back—and that's why we did so well! We had a good
process! But what if the group's performance turned out to be poor? Now people might recall things differently. We argued and fought. We were dysfunctional. Next time we should follow a respectful and
disciplined process. But now imagine a group where people are calm, polite, and respectful of one another. They speak quietly and in turn. If the group does well, participants might look back and credit
their courteous and cooperative nature. We respected one another. We didn’t fight. We had a good process! But if the same group's performance was poor, people might say: We were too polite. We censored

ourselves. Next time, we should be more direct and open, not so concerned about one another's feelings. The fact is, a wide variety of behaviors can lead to good decisions. There's no precise way to engineer


=== 36.png ===
an “optimal” discussion process. We may try to avoid extremes, sure, but between those extremes is a wide range of behavior that might be conducive to success. And because we really don’t know what

makes an optimal decision process, we tend to make attributions based on other things that are relevant and seemingly objective—namely, what we're told about performance outcomes.

Halos on the People and for the People

The Halo Effect shapes many things, including the attributions we make about an organization's people. It’s widely believed that companies that manage their human resources well will outperform
those that don’t. That was, after all, the idea behind O’Reilly and Pfeffer’s book, Hidden Value: How Great Companies Achieve Extraordinary Results with Ordinary People. It makes good sense. A company
that does an effective job of attracting people, provides them with an environment where they can be productive and creative, and motivates them to work hard for the common good, ought to do well.
How could it be otherwise? But watch out for the Halo Effect. If we're not careful, any successful company can attribute its good results to its people.

Here’s a memorable example. In 1983, Fortune published its first survey of America’s Most Admired Companies. The winner was IBM. The following year, in 1984, IBM topped the list again. When asked
to describe IBM's strengths, CEO John Opel gave credit to his company’s people: “The fundamental thing is that the people who work in the company make it a good company. That's really the secret: the
people. It’s our good fortune to have superior people who work hard and support each other. They have adapted to our basic set of beliefs—the standard we expect of one another—and follow those stan-
dards in dealing with one another and with people outside the company. I know it sounds corny, but it’s true, and there’s no point in trying to analyze it much more than that.” And what sorts of people
did IBM look for? Opel explained: “We're a positive bunch of people, the kind who like to do creative things. I believe that like begets like. You look for people with the same qualities as other people who
are building the company.” Not only were IBM's people said to be great, they also guarded against feelings of self-satisfaction. Opel concluded: “If any of us in our company behave in any way that rein-
forces the idea of smugness of power or arrogance, then our image could be severely tarnished. The hero of today can become the bum of tomorrow.”

That's the way it looked in 1984, and of course it seemed reasonable. Every day, John Opel came to work and found himself surrounded by smart, creative, hardworking people. It was only natural to
think that IBM's great people were responsible for its success. But during those same years, IBM failed to see the growing commoditization of its main business lines—mainframe computer systems and
minicomputers. By the end of the 1980s, IBM was slipping badly; and by 1992, it was awash in red ink. Opel’s successor, John Akers, was replaced. How did observers explain IBM’s poor performance?

By pointing the finger at its people and company culture, of course. In Big Blues: The Unmaking of IBM, Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Carroll criticized the company’s “button-down culture,” its “rigid
bureaucracy,” and its “complacent executives.” The same people who were praised in 1984 now were blamed for the decline of a great industrial enterprise. Had they suddenly changed their ways?
Probably not. Had the CEO been blind about his people—had they been complacent and rigid all along? I don’t think so. John Opel was probably entirely honest when he sensed that he was surrounded by
hardworking, excellent people. And they were well-suited for IBM of the 1960s and 1970s. But when the industry changed and IBM missed the turn in the road, its people were on the receiving end of a

very different attribution. Our evaluations depend on whether we think we're seeing a lady or a flower girl.

Halos on our Leaders

Perhaps nothing lends itself to the Halo Effect more than leadership. Good leaders are often said to have a handful of important qualities: clear vision, effective communication skills, self-confidence,


=== 37.png ===
personal charm, and more. Most people would agree these are elements of good leadership. But defining them is a different matter altogether, since several of these qualities tend to be in the eye of the
beholder—which is affected by company performance. It’s exactly what we saw at ABB. While his company was successful, people said that Percy Barnevik had a clear vision, excellent communication
skills, impressive self-confidence, and great charm; and when ABB's fortunes turned, the very same man was demonized as arrogant, too controlling, and abrasive. Of course, it is possible that as ABB's
fortunes fell, Barnevik became increasingly stressed and anxious, in which case causality runs in the opposite direction—from company performance to individual behavior. Yet that argument, plausi-
ble as it may be, was not advanced; no one said that Barnevik had changed.

Bill George, former CEO of Medtronic, advanced a similar list about leadership in his 2003 book, Authentic Leadership: Rediscovering the Secrets to Creating Lasting Value. George wrote that outstanding
leaders share a handful of qualities, including steadfast courage, clear vision, personal integrity, and outstanding character. They are authentic leaders. Not surprisingly, all the examples came from suc-
cessful companies. George also mentioned a handful of failed companies, and their leaders were always inauthentic. Well, you can always find good things to say about leaders at successful companies,
and you can always find reasons to criticize leaders of failing firms. A critical reader ought to ask if any successful companies have inauthentic leaders, and if any unsuccessful companies are run by au-

thentic leaders, because if not, it’s quite possible we're just throwing around Halos. And very predictably—at least for a book written in 2003—listed among the inauthentic leaders was none other than

Percy Barnevik. George recounted the secret pension payoff to Barnevik and Lindahl, described the resulting public outcry, and then observed: “Currently, ABB is operating at a loss, bleeding cash, and
its $40 billion market [capitalization] has collapsed to $4 billion.” The inference was clear: Barnevik was inauthentic—for which the secret pension deal was the smoking gun, the definitive proof—all of
which helped explain why ABB had performed poorly. But of course, no one had suggested Barnevik was inauthentic while ABB was doing well.

George further explained that a quality of authentic leaders is “a burning passion for their missions” and “a laserlike focus on overcoming barriers.” A prominent example? Microsoft's Bill Gates, who
“believed so passionately in Microsoft's mission of unifying computing with an integrated set of software that he was willing to fight the U.S. Government with all his might to keep from being broken
up.” It was easy to applaud Gates’s persistence in 2003, when it was clear that Microsoft would not be split apart. But just two years earlier, in 2001, things had looked very different. Microsoft had been
found guilty of predatory behavior—hardly something that one normally associates with authentic leadership—and ordered to be broken up by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. Gates had been roundly
criticized for stubbornly leading his company into an unnecessary and destructive confrontation with the U.S. government, something that could have been avoided with a bit of foresight and diplomacy.
David Yoffie of Harvard Business School, writing in 2001, contrasted Gates’s leadership style with that of Intel chief executive Andy Grove, whose company had also been the focus of a U.S. Department
of Justice investigation but had taken a very different approach. Grove had carefully navigated Intel's position, admitting no wrongdoing but showing more cooperation with the Department of Justice
and avoiding a bloody trial. Gates, meanwhile, had not given an inch, and the result was a mess. Yoffie wrote: “For years now, Microsoft has been mired in court, facing charges of predatory behavior by
the U.S. Department of Justice and the attorneys general of more than a dozen states. It has seen its name and business practices dragged through the mud, its senior executives distracted and embar-

rassed, and its very future as a single company thrown into doubt. No matter how the litigation is ultimately decided, Microsoft will have suffered significant damage to its business and its reputation.”

Inviting conflict with the government is not good leadership, Yoffie observed: “Even if a company wins the verdict, it can still suffer large penalties in the form of wasted resources, distracted manage-
ment, and a tarnished image. Just ask Bill Gates.” And that wasn't all. A few months after Bill George applauded Gates’s behavior, in early 2004, testimony in a new class-action lawsuit against Microsoft
showed the company to be “combative and rude,” using bullying and other “unfair tactics to compete in markets where its technology was inferior.”

So which was Mr. Gates, authentic or foolhardy? I've been a Gates watcher for a long time now (I wrote my first case study about Bill Gates and Microsoft back in 1991, spending a week at the Redmond

campus interviewing Gates, Steve Ballmer, and a dozen other Microsoft executives), and aside from a major philanthropic commitment to improving world health, he seems to have changed relatively

little over the years. As Microsoft's chief executive, Gates was a highly ambitious, tough, uncompromising, and unapologetic competitor. Did that make him worthy of praise as a brilliant, visionary, and


=== 38.png ===
authentic leader? When Microsoft was doing well, that sort of description seemed justified. Was Bill Gates inflexible and obstinate, sometimes petulant, and occasionally exposing his company to need-
less risks? When times were tough, that sort of criticism seemed reasonable, too. The attributions we made depended on the company’s fortunes.

None of this should be very surprising. A serious scholar of leadership, the late James Meindl at SUNY Buffalo concluded after a series of insightful studies that we have no satisfactory theory of
effective leadership that is independent of performance. We think we know what good leadership is all about—clarity of vision, communication skills, good judgment, and more—but in fact a wide

range of behaviors can be said to fit these criteria. Show me a company that delivers high performance, and I can always find something positive to say about the person in charge—about the clarity of

his or her vision, about good communication skills, sound judgment, and integrity. Show me a company that has fallen on hard times, and I can always find some reason to explain why the leader failed.
Allof which brings to mind a 1964 Supreme Court case about free speech and pornography, in which Justice Potter Stewart memorably wrote that while he could not provide a good definition of hard-
core pornography, “I know it when I see it.” Since good leadership is usually difficult to identify in the absence of data about performance, it seems that leadership is even more difficult to recognize than
is hard-core pornography—which at least Justice Stewart knew when he saw it. For all the books written about leadership, most people don’t recognize good leadership when they see it unless they also
have clues about company performance from other things that can be assessed more clearly—namely, financial performance. And once they have evidence that a company is performing well, they con-

fidently make attributions about a company’s leadership, as well as its culture, its customer focus, and the quality of its people.

Halos in our Surveys

The Halo Effect shapes how individuals think about decision processes, an organization's people, and leadership—and it doesn't go away when we conduct large-scale surveys, either. Quite the contrary.

If we're not careful, surveys might be little more than large collections of Halos, much as we saw regarding the assessments of President Bush. Consider Fortune magazine's annual ranking of the World’s
Most Admired Companies, the one mentioned earlier that named IBM as Most Admired in 1983 and 1984. Every year, Fortune asks thousands of business executives and industry analysts to evaluate
hundreds of companies in eight categories: quality of management, quality of products and services, value as a long-term investment, innovativeness, soundness of financial position, ability to attract,
develop, and retain talented people, responsibility to the community and environment, and wise use of corporate assets. Mix the answers together and you get the World’s Most Admired Companies in
each of these categories—as well as the overall winner. It’s an impressive effort, and it produces an eye-catching cover story every year. Over the years, Fortune has named not just IBM, but luminaries like
General Electric, Wal-Mart, and Dell—a very impressive bunch.

But when some researchers took a closer look, they found that Fortune's Most Admired ratings were heavily influenced by a Halo Effect. The scores on the eight different factors for a given company
turn out to be highly correlated—much more than should be the case given variance within each category. Furthermore, many of the scores were very much driven by the company’s financial perfor-
mance, just what we would expect given the salient and tangible nature of financial results. Two different studies showed that a company’s financial performance explained between 42 percent and
53 percent of the variance of the overall rating. In other words, when a company posts high profits and its stock price is moving upward, the people who fill out Fortune's survey tend to infer that its
products and services are of a high quality, that it is innovative and well managed, that it is good at retaining people, and so forth. Cisco offers a case in point. In 1997, the same year Cisco leapt onto the
cover of leading business magazines, it made its first appearance on Fortune's Most Admired list, entering the charts at number fourteen. Then it rocketed upward, reaching number four in 1999 before

topping out at number three in 2000. It’s no surprise that Cisco rated high for investment value—its stock value was, after all, going stratospheric. But Cisco was rated high for lots of other things, too:


=== 39.png ===
quality of management, innovativeness, quality of people, and more. When the tech bubble burst and Cisco's stock fell, in 2001, Cisco's rating as an investment value quite naturally fell. But with the
Halo of financial performance tarnished, its ratings fell across the boards. Cisco was now less admired for innovativeness, for people, the whole works. Its overall rating dropped to number fifteen in 2001,
then twenty-two in 2002 and twenty-eight in 2003. Fortune's survey isn’t the only one to be undermined by the Halo Effect. Remember the Financial Times's survey of Most Respected Companies? In 1996,
when ABB was at its peak, it was rated high across the boards, for business performance, corporate strategy, and maximizing employee potential, and its leader was applauded for his strategic vision and
focus. Again, the pattern is entirely consistent with the Halo Effect.

And there's more. In 1984, an organization called the Great Places to Work Institute made a big splash with a book called The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America. Every year since then, it has
compiled the Best Companies to Work For index. Based on these findings, the International Herald Tribune claimed that being a Great Place to Work leads to high performance, noting that the companies
on the 1998 list had a total market return (share price plus reinvested dividends) over the next five years of 9.56 percent, compared with a return of 3.81 percent for all the companies on the S&P 500.
The inference was clear: Companies that care about creating a great place to work will attract good people and help them be more productive, leading to superior performance. It all makes good sense.
But how did the institute determine what's a great place to work? Simple, they asked employees. Employees were asked to rate their companies on two attributes: trust and culture. The trust index had
five elements: credibility, respect, fairness, pride, and camaraderie. Credibility, in turn, was measured by responses to statements like this: Management keeps me informed about important issues and
changes. People around here are given a lot of responsibility. High agreement meant high credibility, which meant a Great Place to Work. Respect was measured by asking for responses to questions like this:
Management involves people in decisions that affect their jobs or work environment. I am offered training and development to further myself professionally. Again, high agreement meant respect, which was
associated with being a Great Place to Work. The website also gathered comments like this one, said to be from an employee in a sample company: “There is a high level of trust & empowerment here. We
are not bound by any rules & we can do whatever we want at work. We receive encouragement & motivation from our team leaders. We have company events & wellness programs which allow us to bal-
ance our personal & professional lives.”

At first glance, this all looks plausible, but it’s undermined by the Halo Effect. Companies that are profitable, prosperous, and growing fast will often be perceived as desirable places to work. Again,
look at Cisco. It debuted on the charts in 1998 at number twenty-five, then climbed to twenty-third place in 1999. In 2000, when Cisco was briefly the most valuable company in the world, it shot up to
third place, where it stayed for two years. Once the layoffs hit and the stock price tanked, how was Cisco rated as a Great Place to Work? It fell to fifteen in 2002, then to twenty-four, and finally twenty-
eight in 2004—not exactly tracking performance, but pretty close. Did Cisco become a worse place to work after 2000? Yes, if we think in terms of employee morale and the chance to get rich. But that’s a
reflection of performance, not a cause of it. If you don’t believe the Fortune and Best Places lists are shaded by the Halo Effect, you have to believe that the people who filled out the surveys are not affected

by the same tendency found in participants of Barry Staw’s experiment or by journalists at Business Week, Fortune, and other news publications, which would seem doubtful.

Delusion One: The Halo Effect

In chapter 1, we asked why we know so little about company performance. For all the attention devoted to the question, why is it so hard to understand why some companies succeed and others fail? In

fact, our thinking about business is shaped by a number of delusions, the first of which is the Halo Effect. So many of the things that we—managers, journalists, professors, and consultants—commonly


=== 4.png ===
Chapter 11, “Greed and the Great Recession,” looks at the most important economic event since this book was published, the financial crisis of 2008-09. Rather than bestow Halos on high performers,
now the opposite question was posed: What led to failure? A common explanation was greed. As we'll see, however comforting this explanation may have been, it was really just one more example of the
Halo Effect. Take any failure and it’s possible to point the finger at greed. It makes a good story, of course, but stops short of teaching the most important lessons.

Chapter 12, “Back to the Present,” brings the story up to date, letting us meet up with some of the people and companies introduced in the 2007 edition. We'll see how they have fared and look at the
present landscape for evidence of the Halo Effect.

One last word. A number of readers asked why the 2007 edition said so little about Enron or other examples of corporate malfeasance. It’s a good question, because Enron was a prime example of the

Halo Effect. While it was racking up record gains in revenues and profits, everything from Enron’s corporate culture to its innovative financial engineering to its visionary leadership was heaped with
praise.

Enron had been a poster child for innovation in Gary Hamel’s 2000 book, Leading the Revolution, which made for a bit of embarrassment when the company imploded in 2001—and which led to a
rapid revision, published in 2002. At Harvard Business School, too, laudatory case studies had been written about Enron's creativity and innovative business model, only to disappear from the HBS cat-
alog in the wake of Enron's collapse, where they were replaced with cautionary case studies about corruption and leadership gone astray. Nothing like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.
Hindsight is 20/20 even on the banks of the Charles.

Why so little mention of Enron in this book? Because Enron engaged in criminal behavior, which distracts us from the main lesson. My point is more fundamental: people naturally make inferences
based on overall impressions. The way they do so seems entirely logical. It makes for a coherent story and helps us make sense of the world around us. When we allow an overall impression to color our
thinking, however, we're on a slippery slope. Criminal behavior isn’t necessary for us to fall for the Halo Effect. As soon as we pick our examples based on outcomes, and then make inferences based on
those overall results, we're asking for trouble.

‘My aim—now as well as when this book was first published—is to help managers think for themselves. It’s to let them see through the shoddy reasoning and sleight of hand that often passes for
knowledge in the business world. The Halo Effect was written to help managers to develop their abilities of critical thinking, and to become more adept at grasping the more complex truths of business.

If you're ready to sharpen your skills and to defend yourself against the deluded thinking of so-called experts, this book is for you.


=== 40.png ===
think contribute to company performance are often attributions based on performance. And even when we try to gather data in large-scale samples, like the Fortune survey or the Great Place to Work
study, we often do little more than multiply the Halo Effect.
The Halo Effect isn’t the only delusion that distorts our thinking about business. In the following chapters, we'll come across several more. But in many ways the Halo Effect is the most basic delusion

of them all. It is a flaw—sometimes compounded by other errors—that turns up again and again, weakening the quality of our data and often diminishing our ability to think clearly about the factors
that shape company performance.

CHAPTER FIVE

Research to the Rescue?

‘A famous statistician once showed a precise correlation between arrests for public drunkenness and the number of Baptist preachers in nineteenth-century America. The correlation is real and intense,

but we may assume that the two increases are causally unrelated, and that both arise as consequences of a single different factor: a marked general increase in the American population.

Stephen Jay Gould Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin, 1996

The Halo Effect shapes how we commonly talk about so many topics in business, from decision processes to people to leadership and more. It shows up in our everyday conversations and in newspaper
and magazine articles. It affects case studies and large-sample surveys. It’s not so much the result of conscious distortion as it is a natural human tendency to make judgments about things that are
abstract and ambiguous on the basis of other things that are salient and seemingly objective. The Halo Effect is just too strong, the desire to tell a coherent story too great, the tendency to jump on band-
wagons too appealing.

The Halo Effect shapes much of the way we think about business, yes, but by no means all of it. There’s nothing inevitable about the Halo Effect. If we're aware of the tendency to bestow Halos, we can
take corrective measures. For example, we know that one way to evaluate a job candidate more accurately is to insist that some assessments are made without any knowledge of the applicant's school
—to use standardized tests or to conduct some interviews blind. Similarly, we might expect that careful research conducted by serious scholars trained in scientific methods can avoid the Halo Effect.
Maybe then we can find a satisfactory answer to the most fundamental of all business questions—What leads to high performance?

The good news is that there are many people at business schools and consulting firms who conduct very good research about company performance. They may not be able to run experiments with
the rigor of natural science, but they can carry out solid research using quasi-experimental designs. That sort of study tries to isolate the impact that some variables, called independent variables, have on
a given outcome, called the dependent variable. By carefully gathering data and then testing hypotheses with precise statistical tests, by isolating the effect of independent variables on dependent vari-

ables, these researchers can hope to distill the drivers of company performance.


=== 42.png ===
What's needed, for starters, is good data about the dependent variable—namely, company performance. Luckily, that's usually not a problem. Every publicly traded company publishes its revenues
and profits. There’s plenty of information compiled neatly into databases like Compustat or DataStream, which can give us accounting measures of performance (profitability or return on assets) as
well as market measures (cumulative stock returns, or Tobin's q, the ratio of asset replacement cost to market value). As for the drivers of performance, the data we need depends on what we're trying to
test. For some hypotheses—say, diversification or research and development (R&D) spending or acquisition strategy—the same databases are relatively complete and not affected by Halos. Much trick-
ier are studies about what goes on inside a company, like the quality of management, or levels of customer orientation, or company culture. Here, Compustat or DataStream aren’t much help. Nor has
Bloomberg put together a powerful online database that can tell you which companies are well managed, or innovative, or ethical, or environmentally responsible. These data have to be gathered by the
researcher.

Since gathering data is hard work, a natural tendency is first to look to other studies whose data might serve as useful proxies. But be careful: If these studies are contaminated with Halos, they won't
do much good. Want to study whether companies that are strong in corporate social responsibility outperform the rest? The temptation is to check Fortune's Most Admired list for “responsibility to the
community and environment” and see if it’s related to performance. (Answer: It is.) Want to test whether the most innovative companies outperform the rest? Just check the Fortune list for innovative-
ness and see if it correlates with performance. (Same answer: It does.) Of course they do. But all we're really measuring is the strength of the Halo. What if we avoid proxies altogether and take the time to

gather data directly? That’s moving in the right direction, but even then we might have a problem with Halos—it all depends on how the data are gathered.

Halos of Customer Orientation

Suppose we want to test whether customer orientation leads to high performance. From what we saw at Cisco, we know to be wary of the Halo Effect. As long as sales and profits were up, Cisco was held
up asa shining example of excellent customer orientation. It was described, at its pre-bubble peak in 2000, as having “extreme customer focus,” and John Chambers was “the most customer-focused
human being you will ever meet.” A year later, as performance fell, Cisco was said to have exhibited “a cavalier attitude toward potential customers,” and its sales tactics had been “irksome.” Unless we
believe that Cisco actually got worse—and no one suggested that was the case—all we have are changing attributions about customer orientation made on the basis of worsening financial performance.
We know, therefore, to avoid relying on magazine and newspaper articles and to gather data in a different way.

One study, by John Narver at the University of Washington and Stanley Slater at the University of Colorado, set out to study the link between customer orientation and company performance. They

defined performance as business unit profitability. No problem there. But to capture customer orientation, they asked managers to rate their companies on six criteri:

: overall customer commitment,
creating customer value, understanding customer needs, setting customer satisfaction objectives, measuring customer satisfaction, and providing after-sales service. When they ran their statistical
tests, they found that, sure enough, there was a significant correlation between performance and customer orientation. That's no surprise at all—it’s exactly what we'd expect given the Halo Effect. If
‘we want to test whether customer orientation leads to high performance, the last thing we should do is ask managers: “How customer oriented is this company?” We're likely to get an attribution based
on performance. To have any validity at all, we need to rely on measures that are independent of performance. None of this, by the way, suggests that customer orientation doesn’t lead to higher perfor-

mance—I suspect that if we measure it carefully, we'll find that it does, at least to some extent. But passing out a survey where responses are likely to be shaded by the Halo Effect is not the way to go.


=== 43.png ===
Halos of Corporate Culture

Corporate culture is something else that’s widely thought to affect firm performance. Again, there's plenty of anecdotal evidence about the importance of a company’s culture. We saw it at Cisco and at
ABB, of course, and we find it at other companies, too. During the Tylenol crisis of 1982, when seven people died after ingesting capsules laced with cyanide, Johnson & Johnson took the unprecedented
step of removing all bottles of Tylenol from all store shelves in the United States, even though the deaths had taken place only in the Chicago area. The recall cost $100 million, but it earned Johnson
& Johnson a great deal of respect and admiration. How was Johnson & Johnson able to act so swiftly and decisively? Chief executive James E. Burke said: “Our culture is really it. That’s what brought us
together when the Tylenol tragedies hit. Without it, we never would have been able to manage the crisis as effectively as we did.” According to Burke, Johnson & Johnson had been successful in this crisis
because it had a strong corporate culture. Quick and coordinated action was possible only because Johnson & Johnson employees shared common values about customer health, about doing the right
thing, and about integrity.

The story of Tylenol and Johnson & Johnson provides a memorable anecdote, but a good anecdote can be found to support just about anything. If we want to show that corporate culture has a major
impact on business performance, we have to gather data across companies and look for patterns. That's exactly what John Kotter and James Heskett of Harvard Business School set out to do. Their
findings were published in a 1992 book called, not surprisingly, Corporate Culture and Performance. Kotter and Heskett defined a strong corporate culture as one where “almost all managers share a set
of relatively consistent values and methods of doing business.” These companies were thought to have a “style, a way of doing things that provides internal cohesion, strong commitment to a common
goal, high motivation, and consistency of behavior without the stifling formal rules and bureaucracy.” That’s the key—companies with strong cultures don’t require lots of rules and formality because
people share basic values and ways of doing things. So far, so good.

Kotter and Heskett first tested whether a “strong culture” was associated with high performance. How did they measure “strength of culture”? Did they find a way to capture corporate culture that
was free of the Halo Effect? Not at all. They merely asked managers to rate the strength of their corporate culture on a scale of 1 to 5. Not surprisingly, they found a positive correlation between strength
of culture and performance—just what we'd expect given the Halo Effect. But they didn’t stop there. Even a strong culture, they reasoned, might not lead to high performance if it didn’t “fit” the com-
petitive environment, so Kotter and Heskett tested a second hypothesis: that a company’s culture should “fit” its environment. How did they test for “fit”? Again, by asking respondents to score their
company, this time ona scale of 1 (“terrible fit”) to 7 (“superb fit”). And once again, their analysis showed that high-performing companies had cultures that fit their environment, averaging 6.1 out of 7,
while low-performing companies averaged just 3.7. These results are, of course, exactly what we'd expect from self-reporting. It’s entirely predictable that when performance is high, managers perceive
that their culture “fits” the environment, and when the company is struggling, they sense a mismatch. It would be surprising to find otherwise.

Then Kotter and Heskett took one step further. If a strong culture is good, and a culture that fits its environment is better, perhaps one that can adapt over time is the best of all. But how to measure
cultural adaptability? The ideal way would be to study a company’s culture over several years, watching as it evolves, all the while using measures that are not subject to the Halo Effect. But that takes
quite a bit of time. Instead, Kotter and Heskett assumed that cultural adaptability was linked to two things. First was “leadership’—they claimed that a company with strong leadership should be more
likely to adapt to changing circumstances. They asked respondents: “How much does the culture at [firm name] value excellent leadership from its managers?” with answers on a seven-point scale.

High-performing firms received an average score of 6 out of 7, while low-performing firms scored less than 4, which is just what we'd expect—respondents tend to attribute good leadership to successful


=== 44.png ===
companies. And the second way they tried to capture adaptability? By measuring customer focus! The idea here was that if companies focus on their customers, they’ll adapt more quickly and perform
better. It sounds reasonable, but as we've already seen, asking managers to rate their companies on customer focus is likely to capture little more than a Halo. The results showed that high-performing
companies scored 6 out of 7, while low performers scored just 4.6. But since there was no independent measure of customer focus at all, we really don’t know if customer focus leads to cultural adapt-
ability, which in turn leads to business performance, or whether employees at high-performing companies tend to infer that their companies are good at customer focus. From what we know about the
Halo Effect, the latter is at least as plausible as the former.

Despite these basic flaws of logic and data validity, Kotter and Heskett were emphatic that they had demonstrated corporate culture has a causal effect on performance. Here’s how they summarized

their work:

Corporate culture can have a significant impact on a firm’s long-term economic performance. We found that firms with cultures that emphasized all the key managerial constituencies (customers,
stockholders, and employees) and leadership from managers at all levels outperformed firms that did not have those cultural traits by a huge margin. Over an eleven-year period, the former increased
revenues by an average of 682 percent versus 166 percent for the latter, expanded their work forces by 282 percent versus 36 percent, grew their stock prices by 901 percent versus 74 percent, and im-
proved their net incomes by 756 percent versus 1 percent.

Consider that final finding again: The companies that paid attention equally to customers, stockholders, and employees outperformed those that didn’t in growth of net income over the 11-

year period by a factor of 756. Paying attention to more than just returning profits to stockholders can have a huge payoff.

Note the words “have a strong impact on.” That’s a claim of science: [f you do this, here’s what will happen. The story line is appealing, and the findings might even be correct, but given the flaws in their
research, we really don’t know. The approach taken by Kotter and Heskett really doesn’t let us conclude much about corporate culture and its impact on company performance at all.

Just to be clear, Ithink that strong customer orientation probably does lead to better performance. Companies that listen to their customers, that design products and services to meet customer needs,
and that work hard to satisfy their customers should, all else equal, usually outperform companies that don’t. But you don’t discover these companies by asking: Are you customer oriented? All you'll get
is the self-reporting Halo, cued by company performance. If you want to measure customer orientation, you have to rely on measures that are independent of performance. The same holds for corporate
culture. It stands to reason that when employees share common values and don't need to be told what to do, decisions are made more quickly and people collaborate more easily. But you don’t measure
the strength or the fit or the adaptability of a corporate culture just by asking people who already have an opinion about company performance. Instead, you have to look for specific actions or policies or

behaviors that are not shaped by perceptions of performance.

Delusion Two: The Delusion of Correlation and Causality

If we want to answer the mother of all business questions—What leads to high performance?—one thing is already clear: We have to avoid the Halo Effect. We have to gather data in ways that are
unaffected by performance, so that independent variables are measured separately from the thing we're trying to explain. And the good news is that there are plenty of smart people who think deeply

about problems of data independence and work very hard to conduct careful, disciplined research. Yet even if researchers avoid the Halo Effect, they may still not be able to say much about the drivers of


=== 45.png ===
high performance. Why? The example from Stephen Jay Gould at the start of the chapter gives the main idea: Arrests for public drunkenness and the number of Baptist preachers in nineteenth-century
America may have been closely correlated, but we can’t say much about whether one caused the other. Did the level of drunkenness lead to greater attention about morality in society and therefore a
demand for preachers? Or did an abundance of preachers drive Americans to drink? Or were both of them the result of something different—namely, growth in the overall population? If all we have is a
correlation, we really don’t know.

Inferring causality from correlation trips up many studies about business. Take something as basic as, say, the relationship between employee satisfaction and company performance. It’s logical to
think that having satisfied employees ought to lead to high performance. After all, satisfied employees might be willing to work harder and longer, and might care more about keeping their customers
happy. It sounds right. We know not to measure employee satisfaction simply by asking employees, “Are you satisfied?” since the answers will likely be colored by the Halo Effect. But suppose we look at
a measure that is not tainted by Halos—say, the rate of employee turnover—and we find a high correlation with performance. Now the challenge is to untangle the direction of causality. Does lower em-
ployee turnover lead to higher company performance? Perhaps, since a company with a stable workforce might be able to provide more dependable customer service, spend less on hiring and training,

and so forth. Or does higher company performance lead to lower employee turnover? That could be true as well, since a profitable and growing company might offer a more stimulating and rewarding

environment as well as greater opportunities for advancement. Knowing which leads to which is critical if managers want to know what to do—how much they should invest in greater levels of satisfac-
tion versus other objectives.

Or suppose we want to capture the impact of executive education on company performance. As a first step, we have to avoid the Halo Effect by measuring executive education in ways that are not
shaped by perceptions of performance, like total spending on education, number of days of education per employee, range of educational opportunities available, and so forth. Suppose we find that
companies that spend more on executive education also tend to be high performers. How do we interpret the results? Can we say that investing in executive education leads to high performance? No,
because it could be that profitable companies have the funds to afford a greater investment in education. As long as we gather data at one point in time—cross-sectionally—we won't know. Psychologist

Edwin Locke made the point emphaticall

‘While the method of correlation may be useful for the purposes of suggesting causal hypotheses, it is not a method of scientific proof. A correlation, by itself,
explains nothing.”

Would you imagine that consulting firms do a better job of distinguishing between correlation and causality? Guess again. In 2006, one of the leading consultants, Bain & Company, proclaimed on
its website that “Bain’s clients have outperformed the stock market 4 to 1.” A chart showed that from 1980 to 2004, while the S&P 500 rose by a factor of about 15, the shares of Bain’s clients grew by a
factor of about 60—four times the rate of the market. The implication? That following Bain’s advice leads to higher performance, in fact much higher performance. But there are two huge flaws in this
claim. First, as a Bain spokesperson explained to me, the data in fact show the quarter-by-quarter performance of Bain’s then-current clients relative to the S&P index in that quarter. A 400 percent gap
over twenty-five years, or 100 quarters, translates to an average gap of somewhat more than one percent per quarter—1.4 percent, to be exact—which is not insignificant, but you'd have to enjoy that
difference every quarter for twenty-five years in order to outperform your rivals by a four-to-one margin. Most consulting engagements last for a few years, not for two anda half decades, which means
that the performance gap for a typical client is much less. But the second flaw, and the more important one for our present discussion, is that at best Bain has shown a correlation, not causality. Even if
Bain’s clients outperformed the market average by a little more than 1 percent each quarter, does that mean working with Bain leads to better performance? That's the suggestion, and maybe it’s true. Or
could it be that only profitable companies can afford Bain’s services? That could be true, too, in which case working with Bain doesn’t lead to higher profits; in fact, it might well be the other way around

—only companies with high profits can afford Bain. Again, a simple correlation tells us very little.


=== 46.png ===
One way to improve our ability to explain causality is to gather data at different points of time, so that the impact of one variable on some subsequent outcome can be more clearly isolated. This
approach, called a longitudinal design, is more time-consuming and expensive to carry out, but it stands a better chance of avoiding mistaken inferences from simple correlation. That way we could,
for example, tell whether the advice given by a consulting company in one time period led to better performance in subsequent periods. One recent study, by Benjamin Schneider and colleagues at the
University of Maryland, used a longitudinal design to examine the question of employee satisfaction and company performance to try to find out which one causes which. They gathered data over sev-
eral years so they could watch both changes in satisfaction and changes in company performance. Their conclusion? Financial performance, measured by return on assets and earnings per share, has a
more powerful effect on employee satisfaction than the reverse. It seems that being on a winning team is a stronger cause of employee satisfaction; satisfied employees don’t have as much of an effect on
company performance. How were Schneider and his colleagues able to break the logjam and answer the question of which leads to which? By gathering data over time. It is far easier, of course, to rely on

data froma single point in time and make an assumption about the direction of causality. But that way delusions lie.

Delusion Three: The Delusion of Single Explanations

Anyone with a solid training in research methods ought to know to avoid data sources that are tinged by the Halo Effect. The same goes for correlation and causality: The dangers of inferring causality
from cross-sectional data are well-known. But even if we ward off these two problems, research about company performance sometimes runs smack into a different thorny issue, that of single explana-
tions.

Let’s come back to the question of customer orientation. We know we can't measure customer orientation just by asking, “Is your company customer oriented?” because all we'll catch is the glow off
the Halo, But there’s a better way. A study by Bernard Jaworski at the University of Arizona and Ajay Kohli at the University of Texas—Austin looked into the link between market orientation and perfor-
mance. They defined market orientation in terms of three elements—market intelligence generation, market intelligence dissemination, and business unit responsiveness to market intelligence—and
then asked respondents to evaluate thirty-two separate statements. Most of these statements were not about perceptions, but about objective facts. That’s a big step forward. For example, respondents
were asked whether they polled end users at least once a year to assess the quality of products and services. Presumably that’s something we can measure objectively and will not be answered differently
based on performance. Respondents were also asked whether “data on customer satisfaction were disseminated at all levels in this business unit on a regular basis.” Either that happens or it doesn't; the
rating shouldn't be susceptible to the Halo Effect.

Jaworski and Kohli gathered data from a broad sample of companies in three different competitive environments—market turbulence, competitive intensity, and technological turbulence. That
way, they could compare results across different environments and tell if any effect between market orientation and firm performance was explainable by things like market turbulence or competitive
intensity. When they ran their calculations, they found that market orientation was strongly associated with higher performance. The effect was, in statistical terms, highly significant, meaning it

wasn’t just some random occurrence—something real was going on. Their model had an r? of .25, meaning that it could explain about 25 percent of the variance in company performance. Those are

dramatic results! The authors brimmed with confidence: “The findings of this study suggest that the market orientation of a business is an important determinant of its performance, regardless of market
turbulence, competitive intensity, or the technological turbulence of the environment in which it operates.” (Italics mine.) According to Jaworski and Kohli, better market orientation leads to improved

business performance. They don’t claim that market orientation is everything, but they note that their model explained 25 percent of the variance of overall performance, which is pretty strong stuff.


=== 47.png ===
And they don't hesitate to tell managers what this means: “As such, it appears that managers should strive to improve the market orientation of their business in their efforts to attain higher business
performance.”

Hold that in your mind for a moment as we turn to another topic of current interest, corporate social responsibility (CSR). The idea here is that companies should do more than just pursue profits, but
should think more broadly about the concerns of stakeholders—the community, the environment, the employees, and society at large. It sounds plausible, but is there evidence to show that CSR leads to
better performance? We know not to rely on simple correlations, because even if we find that companies with strong positions on social responsibility also tend to perform well, we won't know which
leads to which. It could be that such things as a good record on environmental protection, high product safety, and community investment do indeed lead to higher performance, but the reverse could
be true as well, since successful companies might have greater funds to invest in socially responsible pursuits. Bernadette Ruf at the University of Delaware and four colleagues set out to test the impact
of CSR on firm performance by gathering data from 488 companies—a good, large sample. They didn’t simply ask managers, “How good are you at CSR?” but used an independent data set that measured
CSR along eight dimensions—a good way to minimize the Halo Effect. To make sure they didn’t confuse correlation with causality, Ruf and her colleagues gathered three years of data. That way, they
could see if improvements in CSR in one year led to higher performance in later years. They also included control variables for industry and company size. No problems so far—this looked like a careful
and rigorous study. When they ran their model, Ruf and her colleagues found that improving CSR led to higher company sales in year 2 and lifted profits by year 3. Again, the effect was statistically sig-
nificant, and the r? was .415 for return on equity, and .425 for return on sales. That’s an extraordinary finding—more than 40 percent of the change in a company’s financial performance was linked to
corporate social responsibility! The authors confidently declared: “The results of the current study suggest that improvements in [CSR] have both immediate and continuing financial impacts.”

But wait. If market orientation explains 25 percent of firm performance, and corporate social responsibility explains 40 percent, does that mean that together they explain 65 percent? Are these
separate effects and therefore additive? Or could it be that companies that are good at market orientation are also likely to be good corporate citizens? That’s hugely important, because if these effects
overlap, then we really can’t say the improvement observed by Jaworski and Kohli was due to market orientation alone or that the performance rise found by Ruf and her colleagues was due to CSR alone.
Maybe they’re explaining the same thing, in which case the explanatory power of each one has been exaggerated. (And indeed, in a 2005 survey, The Economist suggested that many CSR initiatives were
little more than examples of “good management.” Just about any well-managed company is likely to do many of the things we call corporate social responsibility—we'd be surprised if they didn't.)

Now let’s add another study to the mix. Mark Huselid at Rutgers University, collaborating with Susan Jackson and Randall Schuler of New York University, tested the impact of a company’s human
resource management (HRM) capabilities on firm performance. They asked managers to describe their companies on more than forty separate HRM items. They asked questions with an eye to mini-
mizing the Halo Effect, and they also conducted their study over time to avoid problems of correlation and causality. Furthermore, they included control variables for firm size, capital intensity, union
coverage, sales growth, and R&D intensity. They found that HRM was associated with firm performance, and that improving HRM effectiveness by one standard deviation led to increased sales of 5

percent, improved cash flow of 16 percent, and an increased stock market value of 6 percent. The authors were emphatic: “Taken as a whole, these estimates illustrate the impact of effective human

resource management on three widely followed measures of firm performance.” They went on: “Our results support the decade-old argument that investments in human resources are a potential source
of competitive advantage.”

But was this performance improvement due solely to HRM, quite apart from other things like market orientation and CSR? If so, would a company that had already bettered its performance by be-
coming more market oriented and by adopting strong CSR policies enjoy this further boost by improving its human resource management? Or do these effects overlap, maybe even to a great extent? The

latter explanation seems more likely. In fact, it’s entirely logical that a company that cares about its customers and the broader community should also care about its employees. Employees are, after all,

one of the key stakeholders that Ruf and her colleagues included in measures of CSR. Market orientation, CSR, and human resource management very likely overlap to a great degree.


=== 48.png ===
To show just how widespread this problem is, I'll give one more example, this time about leadership. It’s often suggested that the person in charge—the chief executive—makes a big difference in a
company’s performance. Of course that makes sense. We can probably all think of examples where a new leader took actions that seemed to boost performance or, unfortunately, a new boss took the
company in a wrong direction. One study tried to isolate the performance effect of the CEO by tracking the change in company performance immediately before and after a change in leadership. The
data about firm performance and about CEO tenure are matters of public record, so there was no danger here of a Halo Effect from self-reporting or perceptions colored by performance. The authors
found that 15 percent of the total variance in company performance was explained by a change in the CEO. “In other words,” one of the authors concluded, “the choice of a chief executive is crucial.”

Fine, but is this 15 percent in addition to what might be explained by improving customer orientation and CSR and HRM? Or does the leadership effect overlap with the others? Presumably the new
CEO does more than just replace the nameplate and sit behind a big desk in the corner office. The new CEO does something—such as setting new objectives, or bringing about a better market focus, which
may help improve the corporate culture, or overhauling the approach to managing human resources, and so on. The improved performance we attribute to the CEO almost certainly overlaps with one or
more other explanations for company success.

Which brings us to the nub of the problem: Every one of these studies looks at a single explanation for firm performance and leaves the others aside. That would be okay if there were no correlation
among them, but common sense tells us that many of these factors are likely to be found in the same company. Shouldn't we expect a company that was strong at one of these to also be good at many of
the others? Occasionally, a researcher admits as much. The author of the HRM study just cited, Mark Huselid of Rutgers, writing with Brian Becker of SUNY Buffalo, noted that despite their best efforts
to measure accurately the impact of HRM systems on firm performance, there were “unobserved firm-level characteristics, such as the quality of marketing or manufacturing strategies, that might bias
the estimated HR strategy-firm performance relationship.” They elaborated: “The typical concern in this literature is that unmeasured firm effects are positively correlated with HR strategy because of
the adoption of such practices either contingent on firm success or simply a reflection of firms that are better managed across all functions.” Exactly right. And they concluded: “There is considerable ev-
idence in the business press that firm reputations for a wide range of management practices are highly correlated.”

No wonder it’s so difficult to know what drives firm performance. Even if we avoid the Halo Effect, and even if we conduct a longitudinal study, we still have the problem of alternate explanations. So
many things contribute to company performance that it’s awfully hard to know exactly how much is due to one particular factor versus another. Even if we try to control for many things outside the
company, like environmental turbulence and competitive intensity and industry and firm size, we can’t control for all the many different things that go on inside the company.

The problem of untangling rival alternatives is rarely given much attention. The article by Huselid and Becker is exceptional; most articles either touch on the subject briefly in a small section toward
the end, when they discuss limitations of their research, or else they ignore it altogether. Why? Drawing attention to the limitations of the findings detracts from the power of the desired story—which
is to demonstrate the importance of a given variable on company performance. Many academic researchers want to show strong conclusions about cause and effect. They want to demonstrate that
leadership is hugely important, or that human resource management has a major impact on company success, or that strong customer orientation significantly raises performance. Readers, too, prefer
clear stories. We don't really want to hear about partial causation or incremental effects or threats to validity. And there's a further problem compounding all of this. As Harvard psychologist Stephen
Pinker observed, university departments don’t always represent meaningful divisions of knowledge. Some of the most important questions come at the intersections among fields, such as the study of
decision making, which rests at the convergence of cognitive psychology, sociology, and economics. The same holds for business performance, which is shaped by many different factors. Yet researchers
often belong to one department or another. If you're a professor of marketing, you care a lot about market orientation and customer focus, and there’s a natural tendency to want to demonstrate the
importance of your specialty. Same for professors of human resource management or business ethics. There's no real incentive to explore correlations with other factors—better to leave them safely out

of view. As for the journals that publish these articles, many use a “double-blind” review process where the reviewers don’t know the name of the authors, and the authors never learn the names of the


=== 49.png ===
reviewers, in order to preserve impartiality. But almost everyone who reviews an article for the Journal of Human Resource Management believes in the importance of HRM—it’s their field, it’s their
department, and it’s their specialty. Of course they look favorably upon articles that show the importance of human resource management. Ditto for the Journal of Business Ethics—research that shows
how investments in CSR boost firm performance is welcome news, a wonderful validation of their field. And who can blame the Journal of Marketing for publishing a study that demonstrates the impor-
tance of market orientation on firm performance? It would take an unusual amount of self-discipline to point out that market orientation is correlated with so many other things that its impact is small.
Of course, the tendency for exaggeration isn’t found just in academic articles—it’s also found in business press articles like the one that told us how much a Great Place to Work contributed to perfor-
mance. The bigger the claim, the larger the headline—and the greater the temptation to overlook rival explanations.

For a bit of perspective, I'll mention one last study. Anita McGahan at Boston University and Michael Porter at Harvard Business School set out to determine how much of a business unit's profits can
be explained by the industry in which it competes, by the corporation it belongs to, and by the way it is managed. This last category, which they called “segment-specific effects,” covers just about every-
thing we've talked about in this chapter: a company’s customer orientation, its culture, its human resource systems, social responsibility, and so forth. Using data from thousands of U.S. companies from
1981 to 1994, McGahan and Porter found that “segment-specific effects” explained about 32 percent of a business unit’s performance. Just 32 percent. The rest was due to industry effects or corporate
effects or was simply unexplained. So maybe all of the studies we've looked at make sense after all! It’s just that, as we suspected, their effects overlap—they all explain the same 32 percent. Each study

claims to have isolated an important driver of performance, but only because of the Delusion of Single Explanations.

Preface

This book is about business and management, success and failure, science and storytelling. It’s written to help managers think for themselves, rather than listen to the parade of management experts
and consultants and celebrity CEOs, each claiming to have the next new thing. Think of it as a guide for the reflective manager, a way to separate the nuggets from the nonsense.

Of course, for those who want a book that promises to reveal the secret of success, or the formula to dominate their market, or the six steps to greatness, there are plenty to choose from. Every year,
dozens of new books claim to reveal the secrets of leading companies, from General Electric and Toyota to Starbucks and Google. Learn their secrets and apply them to your company! Other books profile
hugely successful business leaders like Michael Dell or Jack Welch or Steve Jobs or Richard Branson. Find out what makes them great, then go do likewise! Others tell you how to become an innovation pow-
erhouse, or craft a failsafe strategy, or devise a boundaryless organization, or make the competition irrelevant. Here's the way to beat your rivals!

In fact, for all the secrets and formulas, for all the self-proclaimed thought leadership, success in business is as elusive as ever. It’s probably more elusive than ever, with increasingly global competition
and technological change moving at faster and faster rates—which might explain why we're tempted by promises of breakthroughs and secrets and quick fixes in the first place. Desperate circum-
stances push us to look for miracle cures.

What's going on here isn’t some vast right-wing conspiracy, or left-wing conspiracy or Wall Street conspiracy or Ivy League conspiracy, for that matter. In part it’s a marriage of convenience. Man-
agers are busy people, under enormous pressure to deliver higher revenues, greater profits, and ever larger returns for shareholders. They naturally search for ready-made answers, for tidy plug-and-play
solutions that might give them a leg up on their rivals. And the people who write business books—consultants and business school professors and strategy gurus—are happy to oblige. Demand stimu-
lates supply, and supply finds a ready demand. Around and around we go.

But there’s more going on than just laziness or greed. Many thoughtful people work very hard to pinpoint the reasons for company success. If they have trouble finding definitive answers, we ought to
ask why. Why is it so hard to determine the factors that lead to high performance? Why is it that even clever minds that earnestly want to uncover the secrets of success don’t find solid answers—even
when they gather huge amounts of data about hundreds of companies over many years? Is there something about the way we ask the question, or the way we go about trying to find answers, that keeps
us from getting it right?

The central idea in this book is that our thinking about business is shaped by a number of delusions. There are good precedents for investigating delusions in business and economics. Charles
Mackay’s 1841 classic, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, chronicled the follies of public judgment, from Dutch tulip mania to speculative bubbles and more. More recently,

cognitive psychologists have identified biases that affect the way individuals make decisions under uncertainty. This book is about a different set of delusions, the ones that distort our understanding of

CHAPTER SIX

Searching for Stars, Finding Halos

We had the sky, up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. Jim he allowed they was made,
but I allowed they happened; judged it would have took too long to make so many. Jim said the moon could a laid them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn’t say nothing against it, because I've
seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.

Mark Twain

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, 1885

The first of the business blockbusters, the megahit that changed everything, was In Search of Excellence: Lessons from America’s Best-Run Companies by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, both at McKinsey
& Co. The book has been widely read and endlessly discussed, but it deserves a fresh look in the context of the Halo Effect and other delusions that deceive managers. Curiously, for all its flaws, In Search
of Excellence holds up fairly well. In fact, it’s almost endearing in its simplicity, at least when compared with subsequent studies that became more complex but also more and more grandiose in the
claims they made. But more about those studies in a little while.

The story of In Search of Excellence began in 1977 when McKinsey & Co, perhaps America’s most prestigious consulting firm, undertook a study about organizational structure, which morphed into a
broader study about managerial systems and skills, which eventually led to a project about managerial excellence. Peters and Waterman started with a broad question: Why are some companies more suc-
cessful than others? They began by identifying the very best American companies through a rigorous process of careful selection. An initial sample of sixty-two strong companies was reduced to a very
select group of forty-three excellent American companies. The very best of them, the cream of American business, included names like Boeing, Caterpillar, Delta Airlines, Digital Equipment, Emerson
Electric, Fluor, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble, and 3M. To understand what made these companies so successful, Peters and Waterman talked to lots of people
and gathered plenty of data. And then, as they described: “When we finished our interviews and research, we began to sift and codify our results. It was roughly six months after we had started, that we
reached the conclusions which are the backbone of this book.” The process was careful, systematic, logical, and objective. No fudging, no cutting corners.

Well, that’s what they wrote in the preface of their 1982 book. Almost twenty years later, Peters told the tale a bit differently. In a 2001 article for Fast Company, titled “Tom Peters’ True Confessions,”

he wrote:


=== 51.png ===
There's an official way that I tell the story now—and it’s total bullshit. The way I tell it now is, “Americans were under attack by the Japanese, who were making good automobiles. So Bob Waterman and
Iset out to discover the real secrets of management.” Usually when I tell that version of the story, I try to use my imitation voice-of-God way of speaking to convey the impression that what we set out to

do was Very Important.

Which is completely wrong.

What really happened? Peters recalls that at first his project wasn’t given much attention at McKinsey—it was “the runt of the litter,” a poor stepsister to a project about strategy. As for their research
approach: “There was no carefully designed work plan. There was no theory that I was out to prove.” Instead, they went around to McKinsey’s partners and asked, “Who's doing cool work? Where is great
stuff going on?” They talked to leading academics and managers; they spoke with “genuinely smart, remarkably interesting, first-rate people.” They nosed around and asked lots of questions. And then
they looked for patterns that might explain what the best companies had in common.

After some time, Peters and Waterman were asked to present their findings to the top management of Siemens. They gave a long and detailed presentation, with more than seven hundred slides. It
was well received, and soon Peters was asked to give a similar presentation to the top management of PepsiCo. The head of PepsiCo was a hard-nosed fellow named Andrall Pearson. (I should know—

some years later I taught with him at Harvard Business School, where he proudly displayed on his wall a 1980 Fortune article that named him one of the ten toughest managers in America.) Peters re-

called: “We all knew that he'd go ballistic at the sight of a 700-slide presentation.” So, with the clock ticking away, Peters sat at his desk, closed his eyes, and leaned forward. Then, as he recalled:
down eight things on a pad of paper. Those eight things haven't changed since that moment. They were the eight principles of Search.”

Here they are:

The Eight Practices of America’s Best Companies, from In Search of Excellence

A bias for action—a preference for doing something—anything—rather than sending a question through cycles and cycles of analyses and committee reports,

Staying close to the customer—learning his preferences and catering to them.

Autonomy and entrepreneurship—breaking the corporation into small companies and encouraging them to think independently and competitively.

Productivity through people—creating in all employees the awareness that their best efforts are essential and that they will share in the rewards of the company’s success.
Hands-on, value-driven—insisting that executives keep in touch with the firm's essential business.

Stick to the knitting—remaining with the business the company knows best.

Simple form, lean staff—few administrative layers, few people at the upper levels.

Simultaneous loose-tight properties—fostering a climate where there is dedication to the central values of the company combined with a tolerance for all employees who accept those values.

Source: In Search of Excellence

In the context of its times, In Search of Excellence was a refreshing challenge to the old-fashioned model of command and control management, of time-and-motion precision, of organization men
working together like so many parts in a smoothly running machine. And take a look at this list: customers, values, people, focus. It’s not much different from the things we saw in chapter 5 that we often
say drive firm performance. Care about your customers. Have strong values. Create a culture where people can thrive. Empower your employees. Stay focused. It may be hard to isolate exactly how much of a
company’s performance is due to culture versus leadership versus customer orientation, because they’re probably correlated, and according to Peters and Waterman, that’s exactly right—outstanding
companies do all of them. That's what makes them excellent! The best companies don’t do one or two of these things, they do them all together! The secret to success isn’t rocket science but follows from
a thorough attention to the basic elements of good management. Peters and Waterman observed: “Far too many managers have lost sight of the basics, in our opinion: quick action, service to customers,
practical innovation, and the fact that you can’t get any of these without virtually everyone’s commitment.” In Search of Excellence was nothing less than an affirmation of basic principles of good
management.

How good was their research? Peters admitted in 2001 that the quantitative data analysis came after they had reached their findings. He explained: “Because McKinsey is McKinsey, we felt that we

had to come up with some quantitative measures of performance.” And how did they reach their conclusions? Did they sift and codify, reducing pages and pages of interview notes into these eight
principles? No, said Peters: “I confess, we faked the data.” Well, I’m not exactly sure what Peters meant by faking the data, because I suspect he didn't need to fabricate anything. If he drew on retrospec-
tive interviews with managers, augmented by articles from publications like Business Week, Fortune, Forbes, and Industry Week, then the data were likely to be compromised by the Halo Effect from the
beginning. It’s no surprise that Excellent companies were thought to be good at managing people and listening to customers, or were said to have strong values or a good corporate culture. We've seen
all that before. If you start by identifying a group of forty-three high-performing companies, it’s hardly surprising that you'll find these sorts of results. Successful companies will almost always be de-
scribed in terms of a clear strategy, good organization, strong corporate culture, and customer focus. But whether these things drive company performance, or whether they're mainly attributions based
on performance, is a different matter. Peters and Waterman went searching for excellence, but they found a handful of Halos.

Of course, none of these finer points seemed to matter. In Search of Excellence arrived in bookstores in 1982, at a time when corporate America was worried sick by the rise of Japanese companies.
‘We were surrounded by cars with names like Toyota and Honda, cameras from Nikon and Canon and Olympus, and televisions from Sony and Toshiba and Sharp. “Made in Japan” had become a mark
of quality. Harvard professor Ezra Vogel declared that Japan was now the number one economic power—ichiban. Bookstore shelves bulged with titles like The Art of Japanese Management. Into this mix
came Peters and Waterman's book with its headline: “There is an art of American management—and it works!” Rarely had a message been so timely or so well received. American managers, gripped
by self-doubt, loved In Search of Excellence. It was the right story for the times. It made good sense. It was inspirational. It was even patriotic. The book sold by the truckload, zooming to the top of the
bestseller charts and staying there for months on end. Phrases like stick to the knitting and managing by wandering around and loose-tight coupling became business buzzwords. As for Tom Peters and Bob
Waterman, they were the first in a new generation of business gurus, traveling far and wide to give hundreds of speeches and conduct scores of workshops for thousands of managers. In 1982, with

their book a titanic success, they were kings of the world.

Excellence plus Two

Part of the appeal of In Search of Excellence was that it wasn't just descriptive—it was prescriptive. The cover declared: “Learn how the best-run American companies use these eight basic principles to
stay on top of the heap!” The implication? Go and do likewise, and success can be yours, too. That's the claim of science: [f you do this, here’s what will happen. But not everyone lived happily ever after. In
1984, Business Week ran a follow-up story under the title “Who's Excellent Now?” By their reckoning, at least fourteen of the companies highlighted by Peters and Waterman just two years earlier had

“Jost their luster.” Many companies had “suffered significant earnings declines that stem from serious business problems, management problems, or both.” Other companies were clinging tenuously

to their status as Excellent companies but had been “humbled by blunders.” What had gone wrong? Business Week cri

cized some companies for changing their winning formula: “The transgressors
ran amok by walking away from the principles that had been key to their earlier success.” They didn’t stick to their knitting! Others were rebuked for their inability to change: “Of the 14 companies that
had stumbled, 12 were inept at adapting to a fundamental change in their markets.” And to top it off, Business Week reported: “Several excellent companies that fell by the wayside overstressed some at-
tributes and ignored others.” To help the reader understand how the mighty had fallen, a table identified which of the eight “commandments of excellence” each company had allegedly broken.

To find out just how well the Excellent companies fared in the years after 1980, I looked to Compustat, a leading business database run by Standard & Poor's, and calculated the total shareholder
return (that is, the percent change in stock price with all dividends reinvested) for thirty-five of the Excellent companies, as well as for the S&P 500, for the five years after the study ended, 1980 to 1984,
and for ten years after, 1980 to 1989. (Some of the companies were privately held, or were divisions of a larger company, and weren't publicly traded in 1984 and 1989, leaving data for only thirty-
five.) How well did they do? Not very well. Between 1980 and 1984, while the S&P 500 almost doubled, growing by 99 percent, only twelve Excellent companies grew faster than the overall market. The
other twenty-three failed to keep up. Some companies did very well (like Wal-Mart, which grew by a whopping 800 percent in those five years), but many well-known names like Caterpillar, Digital
Equipment, Dupont, Johnson & Johnson, and Walt Disney didn’t even match the market average. You would have been better off investing in a market index than putting your money on those Excellent
companies. If we go out ten years, the record is about the same: Only thirteen companies outperformed the market, which was up 403 percent, while eighteen didn’t match the market. Most of the com-
panies weren't even average, never mind Excellent. Sic transit gloria mundi. (Full results are shown in the appendix, table 1A.)

‘Maybe there's a simple explanation for this sharp decline. Stock market performance is, after all, shaped by the expectations of investors. Suppose a company’s stock has been bid up to very high levels,
with price/earnings ratios of 40 or 80 or even more, very much as we saw earlier with Cisco or, in 2006, with Google. If the company continues to perform well and delivers the expected earnings, its
stock price will stay steady but won't continue to rise, because those earnings are already reflected in the stock price. Through no fault of its own, the company’s stock may underperform the market over
the next years. Microsoft is a case in point: While its revenues and profits rose by more than 50 percent from 2001 through 2005, the price of its stock has been essentially unchanged, having been bid
so high in the 1990s. Maybe that’s what's going on here: The Excellent companies had their stock prices bid up to very high levels in the late 1970s, anda slide in stock price over the next years was due
more to investors’ earlier optimism than any real decline in performance. To remove the effect of expectations, used a measure of performance that captured profitability: operating income as a percent
of total assets. Again using data from Compustat, I found that for the five years after the study ended, fully thirty of the thirty-five Excellent companies showed a decline in profitability, some by a small
amount and others by a lot. Only five improved their performance. These results make plain that Peters and Waterman's Excellent companies didn't decline just because they failed to meet market expec-

tations. These companies, chosen precisely for their outstanding performance, actually became less profitable in the years after the study ended. (The results are shown in the appendix, table 1B.)


=== 54.png ===
How should we interpret this flagging performance? When asked in 1984 to comment, Peters remarked: “There's no real reason to have ever expected that all of these companies would have done
well forever and ever.” Of course, no one had ever suggested these companies would be successful “forever and ever.” Some regression is pretty much a fact of nature. But you would think that Excellence
would last more than a few years! In fact, if you make the claim that you've discovered the elements that lead to success, you'd better have an explanation for failure, too. The door swings both ways—Pe-
ters and Waterman can't pretend their principles explain the good times but overlook the bad ones.

So what's really going on here? A first explanation is that many of the Excellent companies really weren't excellent to begin with. Business Week suggested as much in its 1984 article: Maybe Peters and
Waterman hadn't picked the right companies. But that explanation doesn’t hold up very well. With the possible exception of Atari, a one-hit wonder in the early 1980s, the Excellent companies really
were a solid and successful bunch by any standard measure. A second explanation is that companies faltered because they changed their winning ways. Maybe they stopped doing precisely those things
that made them so good. Maybe they lost their desire. Or became self-satisfied and complacent. Or suffered from hubris, a classic theme as old as the Greeks. This explanation, where success contains the
seeds of its own downfall, appeals to our sense of a good story, and it’s the main explanation that Business Week offered. Of course, if we attribute great performance to a clear vision and brilliant leader-
ship anda strong focus, it’s natural to infer that poor performance is due to some error or mistake. Ex post facto, it’s always easy to say that low performance was due to some blunder or to inept
management. Like Huck and Jim trying to make sense of the heavens, we can always say that some stars got spoiled and was hove out of the nest. We can always say they did something wrong to deserve
their punishment. It makes the world seem fair and just. Of course, it’s possible that some companies fit this description, but it’s not a good general explanation, because it would be stunning to find that
so many of these Excellent companies so quickly lost their groove after doing so well—that two-thirds slumped in market performance and thirty out of thirty-five declined in profitability. It's unlikely
that so many companies, selected precisely because of their strong values and discipline and culture and focus, could all falter so quickly. Contagious complacency? An epidemic of entropy? Probably not.
(We could even—a dreadful idea—suggest these companies became self-satisfied because they were listed as Excellent. Hmm, maybe Peters and Waterman were to blame.) Rather, it’s more likely that these
Excellent companies carried on doing much the same things as before, but those things weren’t enough to ensure success—because their success had been due to more than these eight principles in the
first place. It’s also possible that these eight principles reflect attributions made about successful companies, and in fact the drivers of success lie somewhere else. It's hard to know, since Peters and

Waterman selected companies precisely for their success and gathered data by talking to managers at those companies, collecting perceptions and testimonials that were biased by the Halo Effect.

Delusion Four: The Delusion of Connecting the Winning Dots

Peters and Waterman's research method contained a pair of basic errors. First, of course, their data were very likely corrupted by the Halo Effect. Ask managers why their companies are successful, and
we're likely to get attributions of the sort we've seen over and over. Read the business press and we'll get more of the same. There's no need to fake the analysis—because the data are suspect from the
start.

But compounding the Halo Effect was a second mistake: Peters and Waterman studied a sample made up entirely of outstanding companies. The scientific term for this is sample selection based on
the dependent variable—that is, based on outcomes. It’s a classic error. Suppose we want to find out what leads to high blood pressure. We'll never find out if we only examine patients who suffer from
high blood pressure; we'll only know if we compare them to a sample of people who don’t have high blood pressure. The same applies to companies: By looking only at companies that perform well, we

can never hope to show what makes them different from companies that perform less well. I call this the Delusion of Connecting the Winning Dots, because if all we compare are successful companies,


=== 55.png ===
we can connect the dots any way we want but will never get an accurate picture. Under ideal conditions, of course, we might like to conduct an experiment where we assign different treatments to var-
ious subjects and compare results. That's the ideal way, but it’s not easily done when we're trying to study company performance. We can’t take 100 companies, ask half to manage according to one set
of principles and the other half to manage by a different set, and then compare results. It's understandable that Peters and Waterman selected their sample after the fact, but if the only companies we
study are successful, we have no way of knowing what distinguishes a successful company from an unsuccessful one. All we'll do is find out the sorts of Halos that people place on successful companies.
Which is not a bad way to describe what In Search of Excellence is really all about.

But delusions or no, In Search of Excellence was a huge hit, the first of the modern business blockbusters. Why the appeal? Because it worked wonderfully as a story. It told the tale of successful Amer-
ican companies prevailing against stiff competition. It focused managers on a few key points: people, customers, action. It provided inspiration. And nothing was ever the same again. Twenty years after

he shook up the business world, Tom Peters stood by his most famous work:

Was our process fundamentally sound? Absolutely! If you want to go find smart people who are doing cool stuff from which you can learn the most useful, cutting-edge principles, then do what we did

with Search: start by using common sense, by trusting your instincts, and by soliciting the views of “strange” (that is, nonconventional) people. You can always worry about proving the facts later.

The Quest for Corporate El Dorado

One of the McKinsey consultants who worked with Peters and Waterman, Jim Collins, later joined the Stanford Business School faculty and teamed up with a Stanford professor, Jerry Porras, on a new
study about firm performance. Rather than focus on today’s successful companies—many of which might soon falter—Collins and Porras turned their attention to companies that had been successful
over the long term, that had stood the test of time. They hoped to find the “underlying timeless, fundamental principles and patterns that might apply across eras” (italics in the original). The title of their
book said it all: Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies.

Collins and Porras began by identifying 200 leading companies from a wide range of industries, then winnowed the field to include the most durable and successful of them all, the “best of the best.”
They found just eighteen companies worthy of this distinction—truly outstanding, enduring, visionary companies. Among Collins and Porras’s eighteen Visionary companies were great names of Amer-
ican business: high-tech companies like IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Motorola; financial services giants like Citicorp and American Express; health care companies like Johnson & Johnson and Merck; plus
Boeing, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, Wal-Mart, Disney, and more. What a remarkable bunch they were. While a single dollar invested in the general market back in 1926 would have risen to $415
by 1990, a dollar invested in these eighteen companies would have grown to $6,356—fifteen times the market average over those sixty-four years!

Collins and Porras knew that In Search of Excellence had made a critical error in simply looking for commonality among successful companies—it had connected only winning dots. As they noted, if
you look at a group of successful companies and try to find what they have in common, you might conclude that they all reside in buildings. Very true—but hardly something that distinguishes success-
ful companies from less successful ones or that might conceivably lead to success. So Collins and Porras went a next step: For each of their Visionary companies, they identified a Comparison company
from the same industry, of about the same vintage, and that was a good performer—not a “dog.” Boeing was paired with McDonnell Douglas, Citicorp with Chase Manhattan, General Electric with West-

inghouse, Hewlett-Packard with Texas Instruments, Procter & Gamble with Colgate-Palmolive, and so forth. This way, Collins and Porras might be able to isolate what made the most successful and


=== 56.png ===
enduring companies different from others that weren't quite so outstanding. One dollar invested in the eighteen Comparison companies in 1926 would have grown to $955 by 1990, twice the growth of

the overall market, although nowhere near as good as the Visionary companies. Now they had two clearly different groups to compare. So far, so good.

“The Timeless Principles of Enduring Greatness”

The next step was to study these eighteen matched pairs. Collins and Porras recognized the special challenges of social science research. As they explained: “We cannot perform controlled, repeatable
experiments where we hold all but one critical variable constant and assess various outcomes from tweaking that variable. We would love to make petri dishes of corporations, but we can’t; we have to
take what history gives us and make the best of it.” And so, supported by a team of researchers, Collins and Porras undertook a long and arduous process of data gathering and analysis. They described it
under the title “Crates of Data, Months of Coding, and ‘Tortoise Hunting.” First they devised a “systematic and comprehensive” framework for data collection. They read more than 100 books, including
company histories and autobiographies. They consulted more than 3,000 documents, ranging from articles to company publications to video footage. They read Harvard and Stanford case studies. They
performed “extensive literature searches” from sources including Forbes, Fortune, Business Week, The Wall Street Journal, Nation’s Business, The New York Times, and so on. All together, the material filled
three “shoulder-height storage cabinets, four bookshelves, and twenty megabytes of computer storage.” The impression was clear: We were very, very thorough.

At the end of their research process, Collins and Porras distilled their findings into a series of “timeless principles.” Here they are, the keys to enduring greatness, the things that set the eighteen Vision-

ary companies apart from the eighteen Comparison companies:

- Having a strong core ideology that guides the company’s decisions and behavior
«Building a strong corporate culture

+ Setting audacious goals that can inspire and stretch people—so-called big hairy audacious goals, or BHAGs
« Developing people and promoting them from within

+ Creating a spirit of experimentation and risk taking

+ Driving for excellence

It’s anice list with a strong commonsense appeal. In fact, it’s not very different from the list put forth by Peters and Waterman, as Collins and Porras themselves recognized. Many of the same major
themes are present—people, values, culture, action, focus. The sample of companies may have been different, and the research methodology may have been different, but the findings were largely similar.
Built to Last was published in 1994 and became an immediate hit. Inc. magazine gushed: “The In Search of Excellence for the 1990s has arrived. It is Built to Last.” Managers loved the book, and why

not? It was immensely readable. It was filled with memorable anecdotes. And it claimed to offer the keys to lasting success. In its own words, Built to Last provided “a master blueprint for building or-
ganizations that will prosper long into the future.” Collins and Porras didn’t shy away from bold promises: “Just about anyone can be a key protagonist in building an extraordinary business institution.

The lessons of these companies can be learned and applied by the vast majority of managers at all levels.” They concluded: “You can learn them. You can apply them. You can build a visionary company.”


=== 57.png ===
The Chicago Tribune agreed, declaring that Built to Last offered “no less than a revolution in our understanding of what makes companies successful over the long haul.” Built to Last was named the best
business book for 1995 by Industry Week and by 1996 had spent more than eighteen months on the Business Week bestseller list.

Yet for all their promises of exhaustive research, Collins and Porras didn’t address a basic problem: the Halo Effect. Much of the data they gathered came from the business press, from books, and from
company documents, all sources that are likely to contain Halos. They also conducted interviews with managers, who were asked to look back on their experience and explain the reasons for success, a
method likely to be tinged by Halos. And if your data contain Halos, it really doesn’t matter how many cartons you fill. Pick any group of highly successful companies and look backward, relying either
on self-reporting or on articles in the business press, and you may well find that they’re said to have strong cultures, solid values, and a commitment to excellence. It would be remarkable if they weren’t
described in these terms. Pick a group of comparison companies that are good but not outstanding, and they’re likely to be described in somewhat lesser terms. But unless the data were gathered ina
way that was truly independent of performance—that is, unless Collins and Porras could avoid the Halo Effect—we really don’t have an explanation of performance at all. Do these practices lead to high

performance? Or do high-performing companies tend to be described in these terms? The latter explanation is at least as likely as the former.

Built to Last? Not So Fast!

Collins and Porras urge us not to “blindly and unquestioningly accept” their findings but ask that we subject their analysis to careful scrutiny. “Let the evidence speak for itself,” they implore. So let’s
check the evidence. We may not be able to put companies in petri dishes and run experiments, but we can check how they fare over time. If the principles of Built to Last are indeed timeless and enduring
explanations of performance, then we should expect these same companies to continue to perform well after the study ended. Conversely, if they can’t keep up their high performance, well, that would
lend support to the view that these so-called timeless principles were due mostly to the Halo Effect—a glow cast by high performance rather than the cause of high performance.

So how well did the eighteen Visionary companies fare in the years after the study ended on December 31, 1990? All eighteen were still up and running in 2000, so at least they were built to last for
another ten years. But as for performance, the record wasn't so good. Using data from Compustat, I looked at total shareholder return for each company for the five years after the study ended, 199 1-
1995. The results? Out of seventeen companies, chosen specifically because they had outperformed the market by a factor of 15 for more than sixty-four years, only eight outperformed the S&P 500
market average; the other nine didn’t even keep up. (One company, Marriott, was privately held and not included in the Compustat data set.) If we go out another five years, the picture is no better. In
the ten years from 1991 to 2000, only six out of sixteen Visionary companies kept pace with the S&P 500; the other ten didn’t even match the market. You would have been better off investing randomly
than putting your money on Collins and Porras’s Visionary companies. (Full results by company are shown in the appendix, table 2A.)

Again, it’s possible that this decline mainly reflects a failure to meet exaggerated market expectations, not a decline in operating performance. Stock prices are a good indicator of performance in the
long run but may be a poor measure ina shorter time frame. Yet if we look at company profitability, once again monitoring operating profit as a percentage of assets, the seventeen Visionary companies
still don't fare well. For the five years after the study ended, only five companies improved their profitability while eleven declined, with one unchanged. Whether we look to market performance or
profit performance, the picture is the same: Most of Collins and Porras’s Visionary companies, chosen precisely because they had done so well for so long, fell back to earth. The “master blueprint of long-

term prosperity” turns out to be largely a delusion. (These results are in the appendix, table 2B.)


=== 58.png ===
‘And that’s just the companies in the original study. The 1997 edition of Built to Last, written at the height of the book's success, promised that the study would soon be replicated in Europe, where
Collins and Porras had already identified “eighteen European visionary companies: ABB, BMW, Carrefour, DaimlerBenz, Deutsche Bank, Ericsson, Fiat, Glaxo, ING, L'Oreal, Marks & Spencer, Nestlé, Nokia,
Philips, Roche, Shell, Siemens, and Unilever.” Quite a list, that. We've already read about ABB, but several other companies on this list soon fell on hard times, too. DaimlerBenz didn’t fare well after it
bought Chrysler in 1998; Ericsson tottered on the brink of bankruptcy in 2000; and Marks & Spencer fell out of favor with British shoppers. Then we have some whopping ethical problems: Roche was
convicted of illegal price fixing in 1999, and Shell was exposed for exaggerating petroleum reserves in 2004. Strong values and culture indeed.

It really shouldn't surprise us that outstanding companies experience some regression in performance. As companies grow, they find it more difficult to sustain the same percentage growth (witness
the current troubles of some of America’s most successful companies, including General Electric, Microsoft, and Wal-Mart). The fact that some Visionary companies fell back would not by itself invali-
date the overall findings. But the sheer amount of decline, so quick and so extensive, suggests that there’s more going on here than Collins and Porras would have us believe. More likely, the very things
Collins and Porras claimed to be drivers of enduring performance—strong culture, commitment to excellence, and more—were attributions based on performance. As for the Comparison companies, the
picture is a bit cloudier since some were privately held, others were subsequently acquired, and a few went out of business. Of the twelve we can track from 1991 to 1995, seven outperformed the market
while five trailed; and after ten years, the split was six above the market and three below. For profit performance, eight of twelve improved their profitability while four declined. (See the appendix, tables
3A and 3B.) These figures are somewhat better than those for the Visionary companies, contrary to what Collins and Porras would have us believe but very much what we'd expect from regression to the
mean—the highest-performing companies tend to regress more sharply. The differences that Collins and Porras found between Visionary and Comparison companies were more likely attributions based

on performance that had already taken place, rather than differences that led to performance.

Delusion Five: The Delusion of Rigorous Research

Built to Last made a good effort to avoid the Delusion of Connecting the Winning Dots by including Comparison companies, but it didn’t shake off the basic problem we encounter again and again: the Halo
Effect. We can do our best to select samples of high performers and low performers, but if the data are colored by the Halo Effect, we'll never know what drives high or low performance; instead, we'll
merely find out how high and low performers are described. Of course, we don't see how problematic the research really is, thanks to another delusion: the Delusion of Rigorous Research.

Early in the book, Collins and Porras spent ten pages describing their research method, recounting how methodically they collected their data, how many cartons they filled, and how tirelessly they
worked to code the data. Later, Collins and Porras devoted more than fifty pages to three separate appendixes, in which they set out their findings in a number of tables and summaries. Throughout
the book there were repeated references to the sheer amount of data gathered—hundreds of books and thousands of articles, a database so extensive that it filled entire bookshelves and required vast
computer storage. The effect of all this was to present Built to Last as Very Serious Research, carefully designed and meticulously conducted. The message came through clearly: We were thorough. We were
exhaustive. We speak with authority. It all serves to intimidate the reader, for if you haven't done an equal amount of work, you don’t dare question the findings. No wonder the Chicago Tribune gushed
about a revolution in understanding—the study was presented with all the trappings of careful science. Most readers, including reviewers at The Wall Street Journal and Harvard Business Review, as well
as members of the general public, were taken in by the Delusion of Rigorous Research. But of course, the quantity of data is entirely beside the point if the data aren't of a good quality. If your data sources

are corrupted by the Halo Effect, it doesn’t matter how much you've gathered. You can stack Halos all the way to heaven, but you've still only got Halos.

Delusion Six: The Delusion of Lasting Success

There's another delusion at work in Built to Last, and it calls into question the very premise of the study—that of finding the keys to enduring greatness. When two-thirds of Peters and Waterman's
Excellent companies faded within just a few years, we might have been tempted to explain it as just a hiccup, a fluke. These companies were, after all, the cream of American business—surely so many
couldn't go sour so soon. But when more than half of Collins and Porras's Visionary companies failed to match the S&P 500 over the next five years, after collectively outperforming the market by a factor
of 15 over more than sixty years, we should have raised a few eyebrows. Two studies in a row? That would seem to be quite a coincidence. But in fact it’s the norm. Lasting business success, it turns out,
is largely a delusion.

It’s hard to see how unusual lasting success really is when we pick a handful of companies precisely because they’ve done well for many years, then look back over time to explain what happened. But
suppose we shift perspectives and look at the performance of a large sample of companies over time. One study, by McKinsey director Richard Foster and consultant Sarah Kaplan, did just that. Foster
and Kaplan cast their net into the river at a few points in time and looked at the fish they caught. The results were striking. Guess how many companies on the S&P 500 in 1957 were still on the S&P 500
in 1997, forty years later? Only 74. The other 426 were gone—nudged aside by other companies, or acquired, or bankrupt. And of the 74 survivors, guess how many outperformed the S&P 500 over that
time period? Only 12 out of 74. The other 62 survived, yes, but they didn’t thrive. Foster and Kaplan wrote: “The last several decades we have celebrated big corporate survivors, praising their ‘excel-
lence, their longevity, their ability to last.” But companies that last longest usually aren’t the best performers. Enduring greatness is neither very likely, nor, when we find it, does it tend to be associated
with high performance.

How can this be, especially after Collins and Porras told us their eighteen Visionary companies had far outperformed the S&P 500? Well, sure, if we look for companies that have performed well over
several decades, we'll find a few—and then if we gather data retrospectively, we can weave together enough Halos to tell a wonderful story about why they did so well. But that’s an exercise in ex post
facto selection—the Delusion of Connecting the Winning Dots coupled with the Halo Effect. That's like Huck and Jim looking up into the heavens and picking out those few stars that form the exact shape
they want to see. But that’s no way to understand the business world. What’s missing is the flux and the dynamism of performance, the ebb and flow. We can tell ourselves that our handful of compa-
nies, selected by a rigorous and objective process, are a breed apart, somehow better than the rest (and the more rigorous the selection process appears to be, the more we can persuade ourselves these
companies are somehow really better than the rest). But it’s a delusion. We're kidding ourselves. If we start with the full data set and look objectively at many years of company performance, we find the
dominant pattern is not one of enduring performance at all, but one of rise and fall, of growth and decline. Foster and Kaplan conclude: “McKinsey’s long-term studies of corporate birth, survival, and
death in America clearly show that the corporate equivalent of El Dorado, the golden company that continually performs better than the markets, has never existed. It is a myth. Managing for survival,
even among the best and most revered corporations, does not guarantee strong long-term performance for shareholders. In fact, just the opposite is true. In the long run, the markets always win” (Italics
in the original).

Looking for those few golden companies that succeed decade after decade may be a delusion, but it’s one that managers are eager to grasp. After all, showing how companies tend to rise and fall over

time doesn’t make for a very compelling story. We prefer to read about Excellent and Visionary companies; we want to know the secrets of their success so we can try to do likewise. We yearn to find out

company performance, that make it difficult to know why one company succeeds and another fails. These errors of thinking pervade much that we read about business, whether in leading magazines or
scholarly journals or management bestsellers. They cloud our ability to think clearly and critically about the nature of success in business.

Is delusion too strong a word? I don’t think so. A longtime friend of mine, Dick Stull, explains the difference between illusion and delusion this way. When Michael Jordan appears to hang motionless
in midair for a split second while on his way toa slam-dunk, that’s an illusion. Your eyes are playing tricks on you. But if you think you can lace up a pair of Nikes, grab a basketball, and be like Mike, well,
that’s a delusion. You're kidding yourself. It ain't gonna happen. The delusions I describe in this book are a bit like that—they’re promises that you can achieve great success if you just do one thing or an-
other, but they’re fundamentally flawed. In fact, some of the biggest business blockbusters of recent years contain not one or two, but several delusions. For all their claims of scientific rigor, for all their
lengthy descriptions of apparently solid and careful research, they operate mainly at the level of storytelling. They offer tales of inspiration that we find comforting and satisfying, but they're based on

shaky thinking. They’re deluded.

‘Mark Twain once said: “Always do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest.” My purpose is a bit different. Rather than gratify and astonish, I hope this book will stimulate discussion

and raise the level of business thinking. The point isn’t to make managers smarter. The business world is full of people who are plenty smart—clever, quick of mind, and conversant in current manage-
ment concepts. In short supply are managers who are wise—by which I mean discerning, reflective, and able to judge what's correct and what's wrong. I'd like this book to help managers become wiser:
more discerning, more appropriately skeptical, and less vulnerable to simplistic formulas and quick-fix remedies. Why is this a worthwhile goal? I’ve lived in and around the business world for more
than twenty-five years, first as a manager for a leading U.S. company, then as a professor at Harvard Business School, and for these past ten years as a professor at IMD in Lausanne, Switzerland. I work on
a daily basis with executives from a wide variety of industries. What I’ve observed, over and over, is a tendency by managers and professors alike to embrace simple answers, some of them patently sim-
pleminded and wrongheaded, and to latch on to quick solutions rather than to question and think for themselves.

But rather than tell you what to think, I'd rather have you think critically for yourself. You may find some parts of this book to be a bit provocative. If so, that’s fine. I want you to challenge what I write
rather than accept it. One of my role models here is the late Herbert Simon, father of artificial intelligence, Nobel Prize winner in economics for his work on decision making, and professor at Carnegie
Mellon University from the late 1940s until his death in 2001. In his memoirs, Models of My Life, Simon described how his service on several foreign fact-finding missions in the 1960s, often time-con-

suming and very costly, led him to formulate his Travel Theorem, which goes like this:

Anything that can be learned by a normal American adult on a trip to a foreign country (of less than one year’s duration) can be learned more quickly, cheaply, and easily by visiting the San Diego Public

Library.

The response? Simon wrote: “People react almost violently to my Travel Theorem. I try to explain that it has nothing to do with the pleasures of travel, but only with the efficiency of travel for learn-
ing. They don’t seem to hear my explanation; they remain outraged. They point out that I seem to be traveling all the time. Why shouldn't other people travel too? After they simmer down enough to
understand the theorem, they still attack it. It takes a long time to calm their passion with reason—and usually it isn’t extinguished, but temporarily subdued. Why, they think, argue with a madman?”

Well, I think the Travel Theorem is wonderful—not because I agree with it, but because it makes me think. It forces me to ask: What is the real purpose of this trip? Is it for enjoyment or for learning?

If the latter, exactly what am I trying to learn, and what's the best way to learn it? Could my time and money be better spent searching available sources rather than running off to the ends of the earth?
Disagree with Simon's Travel Theorem if you wish, but that’s not the point. The point is to force us to ask under what circumstances it’s correct and when it’s false—and that sort of critical thinking is al-

ways useful.

how we can avoid the seemingly inevitable fate of decline and death. It’s a far more appealing story than the one suggested by the facts: that success is largely transitory and that most companies that
have done well in the past won't outperform the average in the future.

Does this mean that all company performance is just a matter of luck? Is it roughly equivalent to someone who flips a coin and gets heads ten times in a row, but stands no greater chance to flip heads
on the eleventh try than anyone else? Not at all. Success is not random—but it is fleeting. Why? Because as described by the great Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, the basic force at work in cap-
italism is that of competition through innovation—whether of new products, or new services, or new ways of doing business. Where most economists of his day assumed that companies competed by

offering lower prices for similar goods and services, Schumpeter’s 1942 book, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, described the forces of competition in terms of innovation. He wrote:

The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers, goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms
of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.
Every piece of business strategy acquires its true significance only against the background of that process and within the situation created by it. It must be seen in its role in the perennial gale of

creative destruction; it cannot be understood irrespective of it or, in fact, on the hypothesis that there is a perennial lull... .

‘As some companies innovate and find new ways of doing things, other companies fail—but their demise plays a role in a larger pattern of improvement and progress. The dominant pattern is not
stability or endurance, but the “perennial gale of creative destruction” that Schumpeter talks about. It’s entirely normal and very predictable that companies fall back after outstanding performance.

Several researchers have studied the rate at which company performance changes over time. Pankaj Ghemawat at Harvard Business School examined the return on investment (ROI) of a sample of
692 American companies over a ten-year period, from 1971 to 1980. He put together one group of top performers, with an average ROI of 39 percent, and one group of low performers, with an average
ROI of just 3 percent. Then he tracked the two groups over time. What would happen to their ROIs: Would the gap persist, would it grow, or would it diminish? After nine years, both groups converged
toward the middle, the top performers falling from 39 percent to 21 percent and the low performers rising from 3 percent to 18 percent. The original gap of 36 percent had shrunk to just 3 percent, a
decrease of nine-tenths. Now, as Ghemawat pointed out, a persistent difference of 3 percent isn’t zero—it’s nothing to sneeze at. But the main point is that high performance is difficult to maintain, and
the reason is simple: In a free market system, high profits tend to decline thanks to what one economist called “the erosive forces of imitation, competition, and expropriation.” Rivals copy the leader's
winning ways, new companies enter the market, consulting companies spread best practices, and employees move from company to company. Another study, by Anita McGahan at Boston University,
examined thousands of U.S. companies from 1981 to 1997 and found a similar pattern. Companies were placed into one of three categories based on their profit performance during the first three years
(measured as operating income to total assets)—high (the top 25 percent), medium (middle 50 percent), and low (bottom 25 percent). Then they were tracked over the next fourteen years. How much
movement was there among groups? Of the high performance companies, 78 percent were still in the high group at the end of the study, while 18 percent dropped to medium, and 5 percent fell all the
way to low. Of the medium performance companies, 81 percent were still medium at the end, while 10 percent improved to high and 8 percent fell to low. As for the low performance companies, 78 per-
cent were still in the bottom group at the end, but 20 percent moved up to medium and 2 percent moved all the way to high. These findings show that performance is not random but persists over time,
yet there is also a tendency to move toward the middle, a clear regression toward the mean.

These studies, and others like them, all point to the basic nature of competition in a market economy. Competitive advantage is hard to sustain. Sure, if you want to, you can look back over seventy

years of business history and pick out a handful of companies that have endured, but that’s selection based on outcomes. On the whole, if we look at the full population of companies over time, there's a


=== 61.png ===
strong tendency for extreme performance in one time period to be followed by less extreme performance in the next. To revise a well-known phrase, Nothing recedes like success. Suggesting that compa-

nies can follow a blueprint to lasting success may be appealing, but it’s not supported by the evidence.

CHAPTER SEVEN

Delusions Piled High and Deep

We people in organizationland are fascinated with science, I think, because we seek to minimize the feeling that our world is governed not by laws of nature but by mad, impetuous barbarians driven by

greed, need, and the desire for maximum power and booty. In such a cosmos the stately dance of physical science is reassuring.

Stanley Bing

“Quantum Business,” Fortune, 2004

Innovation, observed Joseph Schumpeter, is the basic force that drives market competition in just about every industry—and that holds for the industry of writing business books, as well. The huge
success of In Search of Excellence and Built to Last was bound to spawn new competitors eager to tap the market of managers looking for the path to high performance. These new entrants, according
to Schumpeter, would try to go beyond the standard set by the first two blockbusters, to offer something different and better, to be even more thorough and authoritative. And that's exactly what hap-

ing what really drives company performance—if anything, they repeated some of the delusions we've

pened. But for all their claims of rigor and scientific precision, these studies got no closer to explaii
seen so far, and then offered a few more of their own.

One study, called the Evergreen Project, was directed by a McKinsey & Co partner, Bruce Roberson, working with William Joyce at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business and Nitin Nohria at Harvard
Business School. They began by repeating the most basic of all business questions: “Business is full of mysteries, but none greater than this: What really works?” Companies rise and fall, fads come and

It is time for the first book identifying fundamental

go, but “the great question remains unanswered, and not even well asked: What really works?” Well, the authors assured us, help was on the wa}
practices that create business success—the ones that do indeed really matter.” This book, they declared, was “the world’s most systematic, large scale study of the practices that create business winners.
Instead of anecdotal evidence of personal intuition, it is based on a massive research project conducted with scientific rigor and verified by measured fact.” Strong words! And the authors went further.
In Search of Excellence was inadequate because it selected its sample based on outcomes, looking only at excellent companies but not comparing them with lesser firms. Built to Last was flawed, too, be-
cause it examined a long time period in a single gulp but could not show how actions taken at one moment led to results ata later time. There was no longitudinal dimension, no ability to show temporal
causality. This study would do better. The Evergreen Project picked a ten-year period, 1986 to 1996, and then divided it into two blocks of five years. The result wasn’t two categories but four: Companies

that performed well in both five-year blocks were called Winners; Climbers were so-so in the first five-year block but showed dramatic improvement in the second; Tumblers did well in the first block but

The Evergreen Project described itself as the most massive and most systematic study of company performance of all time. On the very first page, it was said to be “an extraordinary collaborative
effort” of academicians and consultants, and listed by name fourteen professors at prominent business schools who had lent their expertise to the project. The suggestion was clear: This was serious,
thorough, rigorous research. Furthermore, the methodology was said to be “appropriate, honest, and effective—in short, as reliable as many good minds could make it.” But regrettably, this study was no
better than its predecessors. For starters, the Evergreen team conducted interviews with managers, asking them to look back over the ten-year period and recount their experiences. These sorts of ret-
rospective interviews are likely to be full of Halos, as people take cues from performance and make attributions accordingly. The Evergreen Project also collected large amounts of documents about the
companies—“newspaper and magazine articles, business school cases, government filings, and analysts’ reports.” A stack of paper three inches deep was collected for each of the 160 companies, adding
up to 60,000 documents that filled fifty storage boxes. A prodigious amount of data indeed, but from the same sources we've seen over and over, sources that are frequently colored by the Halo Effect.
Next, fifteen Brigham Young University graduate students spent months coding and classifying the data. Too bad, because it doesn’t matter how many students spend how many years coding this sort
of data—you'll just have a stack of Halos, piled high and deep. The authors claimed the result was “the biggest such content analysis ever undertaken.” It may have been the biggest, but it was hardly the
best.

After they analyzed their data, the Evergreen team identified eight practices that were highly correlated with total shareholder return, their measure of company performance. The best-performing
companies—the Winners—had very high scores in four practices—strategy, execution, culture, and structure. They also had high scores in two out of four additional practices—talent, leadership, inno-
vation, and mergers and partnerships. Together this produced a “4+2 Formula.” You can mix and match, the authors said: The first four and any two of the next four will really work. Joyce, Nohria, and

Roberson wrote that “the link between 4+2 practices and business success was astonishing.” They were right—the numbers are remarkable. Take a look:

Table 7. 1 The Evergreen Project: Winners and Losers on Four Primary Practices

Highly Positive Highly Negative

Strategy: Devise and maintain a clearly stated, focused strategy Winners 82% 7%
Losers 9% 77%

Execution: Develop and maintain flawless operational execution Winners 81% 4%
Losers 14% 56%

Culture: Develop and maintain a performance-oriented culture Winners 78% 3%

Losers 17% 47%



=== 64.png ===
Structure: Build and maintain a fast, flexible, flat organization Winners 78% 3%

Losers 14% 50%

Source: What Really Works, p. 19.

For the first practice, strategy, fully 82 percent of the Winners were rated “highly positive” while just 7 percent were “highly negative.” By contrast, only 9 percent of the Losers were rated “highly posi-

tive” while 77 percent were “highly negative.” (Climbers and Tumblers were not reported on this table.) Regarding execution, 81 percent of Winners were rated “

ighly positive” and only 4 percent “highly
negative”; for Losers it was 14 percent “highly positive” and 56 percent “highly negative.” The findings for culture and structure were almost as dramatic. And if a company was “highly positive” on all
four? The Evergreen team concluded: “A company consistently following the formula had a better than 90% chance of being a Winner.”

Given the doubts we have about data validity, the interpretation of these findings is open to question. Take, for example, the assessment of corporate culture. The Evergreen Project wanted to assess
whether a company had “a work environment that is challenging, satisfying, and fun” and “inspired all to do their best,” and it found that Winners had high scores on both items. Well, it’s no surprise
that high-performing companies were perceived to have a challenging work environment and that they were thought to inspire people to do their best. The same would have been said about Cisco at
its peak, about ABB in its heyday, and about IBM during its glory years. Or take execution capabilities. The Evergreen Project wanted to evaluate whether a company “delivers products and services that
consistently meet customers’ expectations” and whether it “constantly strives to improve productivity and eliminate all forms of excess and waste.” Again, it's no surprise that successful companies
were said to have high-quality products and to improve productivity and eliminate waste—at least as long as they were successful! But given the way these data were gathered, it’s not clear at all that
the “4+2 Formula” led to performance. In fact, a very different interpretation is more likely. High-performing companies were said to have a clearly stated, focused strategy. They were perceived to have a
performance-oriented culture. They were seen to be good at execution. They were said to have fast and flat organizations. Taken together, Winners hada more than 90 percent chance of being described as
highly positive on these four criteria. All of which is a world away from saying, If you do these things, you will be successful.

The results on table 7.1 suggest a further speculation. Take a close look at the figures. While 7 percent of the Winners were said not to have followed a “clearly stated, focused strategy,” only 3 percent
of Winners were said not to have a “performance-oriented culture,” and only 3 percent were said not to have a “flat, flexible organization.” What explains the difference between 7 percent and 3 percent?
‘My hunch is that it has to do with the amorphous nature of “corporate culture” and “organization.” Our impression of whether a company has a “clearly stated, focused strategy” is shaped to a large
degree by its performance, yes, but our perceptions about a company’s culture and organization are almost entirely shaped by what we know ofits performance. In our everyday conversations, we have
almost no ability to evaluate whether a company has a “performance-based culture” or a “fast, flexible, flat organization” without knowing something about its performance. The ways we describe,

mythologize, and sometimes speak rhapsodically about company culture and organization are almost entirely the result of performance.

Delusion Seven: The Delusion of Absolute Performance

In addition to presenting tables of data, What Really Works painted vivid portraits of two companies, one Winner and one Loser. The Winner, Dollar General, sounded like many of the successful compa-

nies we've read about: It had a clearly stated and laser-focused strategy, deep concern about its customers, a great company culture, plus an effective organization and outstanding leadership. The Loser,


=== 65.png ===
Kmart, was a company that seemingly got it all wrong: The strategy kept changing, the culture was miserable, execution was weak, and the organization was in disarray. Kmart made a wonderful whip-
ping boy—imagine getting all four elements wrong at once! Think of the stunning incompetence that must have been present in such a company!

What could be wrong with this thinking? Well, two things. First is the Delusion of Single Explanations, which we talked about in chapter 5. These four elements might not be separate and independent
at all but are very likely linked. Remember ABB in 2000. One explanation for its downward spiral was that a questionable shift in strategy led to declining performance, which led to a change in the top
manager, who promptly reorganized the company, which hurt morale, leading to even worse performance. We can think of a similar scenario for Kmart. Imagine that at some point, Kmart’s ability to
execute began to slip, perhaps because of sloppy inventory management or problems in supply chain efficiency. As performance faltered, employee morale sagged and the company culture worsened.
Seeking to pull out of its slump, Kmart executives responded by shifting the strategy, which in turn required a different organization design. In such a scenario, these four elements aren't independent
at all—one leads to another. There are plenty of others we could imagine: For example, an ill-advised organizational redesign could have led to inefficiencies in execution, which led to worsened perfor-
mance and a decline in morale, which caused managers to embark on a new strategy, and so forth, around and around. The mistake, once again, is to imagine these various elements are separate rather
than closely linked.

Second, and more important, the example of Kmart shows up a delusion that is implicit in many of the studies we've seen so far, one that's very basic but often overlooked—indeed, a 2005 Harvard
Business Review article that compared several studies of company performance missed the point entirely. I call it the Delusion of Absolute Performance. Companies are often described as succeeding or
failing on the merits of their actions alone, as if performance were absolute. But in a competitive market economy, the performance of one company is always affected by the performance of other com-
panies. Part of the problem is that we often think in terms of images from laboratory scientific research. Put a beaker on a stove and you'll find that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius, a bit less at high
altitude. Line up a hundred beakers on a hundred stoves and you'll still find that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. One beaker isn’t affected by any other. But that’s not the way it is in business.

To show how company performance is intrinsically relative, Il present some data about a major U.S.-based retailer, a well-known company with hundreds of stores nationwide. I've made an effort to
include only things that seem objectively verifiable and not shaped by the Halo Effect. To disguise the identity of this company, I'll give it a fictitious name: “Qual-Mart.” According to the report of an in-

dependent industry analyst, Alex. Brown & Sons, during the early 1990s, “Qual-Mart” did these things:

«Installed point-of-sale terminals in its stores, which provided better information on sales by item and improved the inventory planning process.

- Expanded central buying to 75 percent of its merchandise, helping to reduce the costs of procurement.

« Modernized its inventory management and thereby significantly improved its “in-stock position.” One result: better management of seasonal inventory, boosting Christmas and Halloween sales by 60

percent.

«Conducted physical inventory counts more frequently, not just once at year-end, resulting in greater accuracy and efficiency.

+ Reduced its expense levels as a percentage of sales.

- Improved its merchandise assortment to match current demand trends, helping to raise sales.


=== 66.png ===
«Installed a toll-free customer service number, which led to a sharp improvement in customer satisfaction.

«Implemented a sophisticated client/server technology that led to better merchandise management and savings of $240 million.

Thanks to these many steps, “Qual-Mart” saw an improvement in inventory turns—that is, how many times in a year it sold its inventory, a key measure of retailing efficiently—from 3.45 in 1994 all

the way to 4.56 in 2002. That's a jump of 32 percent, not bad at all.

Table 7.2 Inventory Turns at “Qual-Mart” 1994-2002

Would you say “Qual-Mart” improved its performance? Of course you would—it got significantly better at a number of important things, each one measured objectively. So you might be surprised
to learn that the company we're talking about is Kmart. That’s right: Kmart, the Evergreen Project's Loser with a capital L, the poster child of mismanagement, the guys who supposedly got everything
wrong. How can a company seem to do so many things better and still wind up in the bone yard? Because its rivals improved at an even faster rate. Over the same eight years, Wal-Mart's inventory turns
went from 5.14 all the way to 8.08, up 63 percent. Wal-Mart had faster turns at the start of the eight-year period than Kmart had at the end. Kmart got better in absolute terms and yet fell further behind

at the same time—and the gap between the two retailers was growing ever wider.

Table 7.3 Inventory Turns at Kmart and Wal-Mart, 1994-2002

As for other measures of performance, Alex. Brown & Sons noted that Kmart improved in “the key areas of expense ratio reduction, in-stock position, and visual presentation,” but its major rivals
also got better—in fact, much better. It went on: “Both Wal-Mart and Target, by our estimate, continue to enjoy significant advantages on the expense ratio front—allowing them to be quite assertive
on price and to post still higher financial returns than Kmart.” And that wasn’t all. By the early 1990s, while Kmart raised the amount of centrally purchased inventory to 75 percent, Wal-Mart reached

80 percent. Kmart installed point-of-sale scanning in its stores by 1990, but Wal-Mart had done the same two years earlier. No wonder Kmart was scrambling. Its rivals were driving down costs and


=== 67.png ===
improving logistics at an even faster rate. By 2002—just as its inventory turns were reaching an all-time high!—Kmart hoisted the white flag and shuffled off to bankruptcy court. It’s irresistible to infer
that a bankrupt company must have been poor at execution, but the evidence doesn’t support that view at all, at least not if we're talking about execution in an absolute sense.

The difference between absolute and relative performance can be seen at other companies as well. Consider General Motors, another company with slumping sales and a falling share price. In 2005,
GM's debt was reduced to junk bond status, hardly a vote of confidence from financial markets. Yet compared with the automobiles it produced in the 1980s, GM's cars are much better in so many re-
spects: better quality, additional features, superior comfort, and improved safety. Owing to a myriad of factors, its share of the U.S. market keeps slipping, from 35 percent in 1990 to 29 percent in 1999
to 25 percent in 2005, as Japanese and Korean automakers continue to gain share. GM’s declining performance has to be understood in relative terms. In fact, the rigors of competition from Asian au-
tomakers are precisely what stimulated GM to improve. Is GM a better automaker than it was a generation ago? Sure, by absolute measures. But try telling that to its employees or shareholders.

The Delusion of Absolute Performance is hugely important because it suggests that companies can achieve high performance by following a simple formula, regardless of the actions of competitors. If
left unchecked, managers may pay attention to a misleading set of issues. The Evergreen Project wasn’t alone in this basic misconception—the same delusion was implicit in Built to Last, where Collins
and Porras claimed that following a handful of steps provided a “blueprint for enduring success” without any mention of rivals or any appreciation of the dynamics of industry competition. Yet once we
see that performance is relative, it becomes obvious that companies can never achieve success simply by following a given set of steps, no matter how well intended; their success will always be affected
by what rivals do. The greater the number of rivals, and the easier for new competitors to enter the market, and the more rapidly technology changes, the more difficult it is to sustain success. That’s an
uncomfortable truth, because it admits that some elements of business performance are outside of our control. It’s far more appealing to downplay the relative nature of performance or ignore it com-
pletely. Telling a company it can achieve high performance, regardless of what competitors do, makes for a more attractive story.

The Evergreen Project had a good idea to break the ten-year time period into two blocks of five years but was undone by the reliance on data from retrospective interviews and from articles in the

business press. Yet these failings didn’t prevent the authors from claiming they had broken new ground in our understanding of company success. In fact, they made a stronger claim of scientific rigor

and causal impact than either In Search of Excellence or Built to Last. As they presented their findings, the authors declared: “We can now say that improving upon specific practices virtually guarantees a
company’s superior performance.” But they showed nothing of the kind. The correct title shouldn't be What Really Works—the use of the present tense is misplaced. More accurate would be What Really

Worked, or perhaps even What Was Said About Companies When They Really Worked.

The Grand Delusions of Good to Great

At the same time the Evergreen Project was under way, one of the authors of Built to Last, Jim Collins, embarked on a new study of company performance. Whereas Built to Last looked at companies
that had been, for the most part, always successful (well, at least until the study ended), most companies tend to muddle along, doing reasonably well but never achieving great success. What could be
said to them? Collins's next project addressed this point directly. How, he wondered, did ordinary companies make the shift to outstanding performance? Why did some companies make the leap from
Good to Great while others didn’t?

Collins and his team of researchers began with a large sample—all the companies on the Fortune 500 between 1965 and 1995, 1,435 in all. To find those that had gone from mediocre to magnificent,

they undertook what they described as a “death march of financial analysis.” Their objective was to find those companies that fit a specific pattern: fifteen years of stock market returns near the general


=== 68.png ===
average, “punctuated by a transition point,” then followed by fifteen years of stock market returns well above the average. This image is commonly known as a “hockey stick,” a flat blade and an upward
shaft. It's well-known in the business world, as in: “Things aren't so good today, but don’t worry, we're going to do great things in the future.” Everyone in the business world wants to deliver a hockey
stick, whether to their boss or to their investors. Everyone wants to find the key to sudden and sustained improvement. Collins had his finger on a hot button.

Of all the companies they examined, just eleven fit the stringent profile—fewer than one ina hundred. Here's the list: Abbot, Circuit City, Fannie Mae, Gillette, Kimberly-Clark, Kroger, Nucor, Philip
Morris, Pitney Bowes, Walgreen's, and Wells Fargo. Some of these companies were well-known to the general public, but many were not. They were hardly the glamor companies of the day but a plain
Jane assortment from everyday industries like retail, steel, consumer products, and financial services. Their headquarters weren't in Silicon Valley or Princeton or New York City, but in ordinary Amer-
ican cities like Dayton, Ohio, and Neenah, Wisconsin. They hadn't been born great but had languished in mediocrity for years. Collins wrote: “At first, we were surprised by the list. Who would have
thought that Fannie Mae would beat companies like GE and Coca-Cola. Or that Walgreen's could beat Intel. The surprising list—a dowdier group would be hard to find—taught us a key lesson up front.
It is possible to turn good into great in the most unlikely of situations.” And these eleven Great companies did indeed have a terrific record of performance. A single dollar invested in each of these com-
panies in 1965, with all dividends reinvested, would have grown to $471 by the end of 2000, compared to $56 for the overall market. Next, as he had done in Built to Last, Collins identified a suitable
comparison for each Great company, picking a good company in the same industry and active at about the same time. Gillette was matched with Warner-Lambert, Kimberly-Clark with Scott Paper, Wells
Fargo with Bank of America, and so forth. The Comparison companies were good but hardly Great—a dollar invested in each of them in 1965 would have grown to $93, about twice the overall market but
far less than the Great companies. In the years after the study, most of the eleven Good to Great companies, selected because they had outperformed the general market by a torrid three-to-one margin
over fifteen years, regressed somewhat, but that’s not grounds to criticize Collins's study. His goal was not to predict anything beyond fifteen years of rapid growth, but to explain why those fifteen ter-
rific years took place at all—why these companies became Great while others did not. If he could explain that transition, what transpired after the end of the study really wouldn't matter.

To explain the transition from Good to Great, Collins and his team of researchers labored for nearly five years. They devoted more than 15,000 hours to the project. They looked at a wide range of
evidence, “everything from acquisitions to executive compensation, from business strategy to corporate culture, from layoffs to leadership style, from financial ratios to management turnover.” They
read dozens of books, reviewed more than 6,000 articles, and conducted scores of interviews. The data filled many crates and entire cabinets, and totaled 384 million bytes. By now we're used to these
descriptions of rigorous research, and we know not to be impressed—the quality of data is what’s important, not the quantity.

As for data quality, some appear to be free of the Halo Effect. Measures of top manager turnover, for example, or the presence of major institutional shareholding blocks, or the extent of board owner-
ship, are all matters of public record and not likely to be shaped by perceptions, whether by journalists, company spokespeople, or the recollections of the managers themselves. But much of the data was
problematic. A great deal came from magazine and newspaper articles, the same sources we've seen time and again, and which are steeped in Halos. There was no effort to ensure that the data were free

of Halos—in fact, there was not even a recognition that these data sources were potentially flawed. As for the interviews with managers, among the questions asked were these:

What do you see as the top five factors that contributed to or caused the upward shift in performance during the years [ten years before transition] to [ten years after transition]?

What was the process by which the company made key decisions and developed key strategies during the transition era—not what decisions the company made, but how did it go about making them?

How did the company get commitment and alignment with its decisions?

Interview questions of this nature, where managers are asked to look back and explain what happened, rarely produce valid data, since retrospective self-reporting is commonly biased by perfor-
mance.
As for coding and analyzing the data, Collins described a series of discussions and debates among members of his research team. They followed “an iterative process of looping back and forth, de-

veloping ideas and testing them against the data, revising the ideas, building a framework, seeing it break under the weight of evidence, and rebuilding it again.” Why did Collins take a seemingly less

formal approach than he had followed in Built to Last? He explained: “We all have a strength or two in life, and I suppose mine is the ability to take a lump of unorganized information, see patterns, and
extract order from the mess—to go from chaos to concept.” As for the patterns that Collins and his team found, the fifteen years of average performance were described as a Buildup phase, characterized
by strong yet humble leadership (known as “Level Five Leadership”), getting the right people on board (“First Who ... Then What”), and facing reality directly and courageously (“Confront the Brutal

Facts”). Then, without fanfare, sometimes with barely a notice, a point of inflection led to a Breakthrough phase, with the once good company now soaring onward and upward ina self-reinforcing

virtuous circle of greatness, ascending to the glory of the brightness at an angle of forty-five degrees, launched like a shot off a shovel. Breakthrough was about focus (“the Hedgehog Concept”), about ex-
ecution (“Culture of Discipline”), and finally, about using technology to reinforce progress (“Technology Accelerators).” The transformation was complete, and Good was now Great.

As with earlier studies, the presence of Halos forces us to question these findings. Does having “humble leadership” and “great people” lead to success? Or is it more likely that successful companies

are described as having excellent leadership, better people, more persistence, and greater courage? Given the way the data were gathered, and given the widespread tendency to make attributions based
on performance, the latter seems more likely than the former. Collins claimed to explain why some companies made the leap while others didn’t, but in fact he did nothing of the kind. Good to Great
documented what was written and said about companies that had made the leap versus those that had not—which is completely different. At the start of his book, Collins urges his readers to be honest,
to “confront the brutal facts.” Well, here’s a brutal fact we may wish to consider: If you start by selecting companies based on outcome, and then gather data by conducting retrospective interviews and
collecting articles from the business press, you're not likely to discover what led some companies to become Great. You'll mainly catch the glow from the Halo Effect.

Yet no one seemed to look closely at these shortcomings, because Good to Great had such an encouraging message: You, too, can transform your good company into a Great one. Collins was explicit on
this point. He wrote: “Greatness is not a matter of circumstance. Greatness, it turns out, is largely a matter of conscious choice.” It’s a compelling story. People want to believe their good efforts will be
rewarded, that good things come to those who wait, and that’s exactly what Collins was saying: With vision and humility, by caring about people, through persistence and focus, you can become Great.

Asa tale of inspiration, there’s hardly a better one than Good to Great.

Delusion Eight: The Delusion of the Wrong End of the Stick

The reliance on flawed data in Good to Great raises serious questions about the validity of its findings. But even if we set aside those questions and accept the data, we have a further problem, this one
about the interpretation of findings. One of the central images in Good to Great is the Hedgehog Concept, drawn from Isaiah Berlin's famous essay “The Hedgehog and the Fox.” Berlin wrote that many
people fall into one of two basic categories. Foxes know many things—they are fleet and cunning, and they pursue many aims. Hedgehogs know one big thing—they look to be slow and methodical, but
they stay focused on a single unifying vision. And this distinction, wrote Collins, has everything to do with achieving high performance, because the eleven Great companies were all Hedgehogs. They

had a narrow focus and pursued it with great discipline. Foxlike companies, by contrast, scattered their attention and energy, often changed directions, but never became Great. There is, of course, a pos-


=== 7.png ===
Most management books ask the first-order question: What leads to high performance? This book sets out to answer a different question: Why is it so hard to understand high performance? My aim is to
pull back the curtains and ask the questions we don’t often raise, to point out some of the delusions that keep us from seeing clearly. Much of this book, chapters 2 through 8, shows why the experts—
gurus, consultants, professors, and journalists—are so often wrong. It exposes delusions that are all around us—in the business press, in academic research, and in recent bestsellers. But that takes us
only so far. Once we've cleared away the delusions that permeate so much popular thinking about business, what then? The second thing a wise manager must do is focus on the elements that drive
company performance while recognizing the fundamental uncertainty at the heart of the business world. The remainder of the book, chapters 9 and 10, takes up these questions, suggesting how man-
agers might replace delusions with a more discerning way of understanding company performance, one that respects probabilities. Fortunately, there are managers on the scene today who provide good
role models, and the final chapter offers a few brief portraits that can serve as examples for the rest of us.

Is there a pot of gold at the end of this rainbow? Not in the usual sense of the term. You won't find any promises of guaranteed results anywhere in these pages. There’s no assurance that success
follows predictably if you adopt these four rules, or live by that five-point plan, or commit yourself to those six steps. Yet I'm convinced that a clear-eyed and thoughtful approach is a better way to think
about management—better, anyway, than the kind of casual thinking that characterizes so much of what's on business bookshelves today.

Another of the wise men whose voice appears in these pages, the physicist Richard Feynman, once remarked that many fields have a tendency for pomposity, to make things seem deep and profound.
It’s as if the less we know, the more we try to dress things up with complicated-sounding terms. We do this in countless fields, from sociology to philosophy to history to economics—and it’s definitely
the case in business. I suspect that the dreariness in so much business writing often stems from wanting to sound as though we have all the answers, and from a corresponding unwillingness to recog-

nize the limits of what we know. Regarding a particularly self-important philosopher, Feynman observed:

Itisn't the philosophy that gets me, it’s the pomposity. If they'd just laugh at themselves! If they'd just say, “Ithink it's like this, but von Leipzig thought it was like that, and he had a good shot at it, too.”
If they'd explain that this is their best guess.

Well, this is my best guess. This is the way I see it.


=== 70.png ===
sibility that our classification is shaped by the Halo Effect—when viewed in retrospect, successful companies may tend to be described as more focused and persistent than less successful companies.
But let’s suppose that Collins got it right and the eleven Great companies really were more focused on a narrow core vision than the Comparison group. What then? Dees it follow that companies perform
better when they behave like Hedgehogs? Not quite. The story is a bit more complicated.

To see why, consider a somewhat different example. Imagine that a thousand people spend the day betting at the racetrack, and at the end of the day we select the ten bettors with the highest win-
nings—we'll call them our Great bettors. When we look closely at these most successful bettors, we're likely to find that all of them placed big bets on long shots—that’s how they came out ahead of the
other 990. They were Hedgehogs, focusing on a few big things. Very few Foxes will be among the top ten, because Foxes tend to diversify their positions. Yet even if the top ten bettors were all Hedge-
hogs, it does not follow that Hedgehogs, on average, outperformed Foxes, because some Hedgehogs may have done very well but many more may have gone home broke. In fact, overall Foxes probably
did better than Hedgehogs—they took more prudent risks and avoided big losses. Now let’s come back to companies. Because Collins selected eleven Great companies and then compared them with
eleven that were only Good, we have no way of knowing whether, on average, companies did better when they behaved like Foxes or like Hedgehogs. We don’t know how many of the 1,435 companies
in the full sample were Hedgehogs and how many were Foxes, so we can't say which group performed better. Even if companies that racked up several years of consecutive growth were Hedgehogs, it
doesn’t follow that being a Hedgehog increased the chances of success—because lots of Hedgehogs might have wound up as roadkill.

‘Asa point of comparison, consider a study about expert political judgment by Philip Tetlock at the University of California. Using the same categories drawn from Isaiah Berlin, Tetlock compared
the predictive accuracy of Hedgehogs, experts who have a clear and strongly held worldview, with that of Foxes, experts who take a more flexible view. Which group made more accurate predictions of
future events? The Foxes. They factored in a wider range of information and modified their beliefs in the face of changing circumstances, and as a result were consistently more accurate in their judg-
ments about future events than Hedgehogs. Tetlock found that a few Hedgehogs were extremely accurate in their judgments, but many more were considerably off the mark, and on average scored less
well. (Tetlock’s study, by the way, examined the accuracy of predictions over the course of fifteen years—this was not a study about a fifteen-year window that was conducted in retrospect and therefore
prone to hindsight biases, but a study that was conducted from 1988 to 2003, over a fifteen-year period!)

‘My guess is that Tetlock’s findings about individual predictive judgment are about right for companies, too: On average, companies that are resilient and can adjust to changing circumstances tend on
average to outperform less flexible companies. Yes, a few Hedgehogs will turn out to be spectacularly successful, but Hedgehogs will also fail in large numbers. Which group does better is an empirical
question that hasn't yet been the subject of careful study, and until we have solid answers we can only speculate. But until then, we're on shaky grounds if we infer that because a handful of extremely
successful companies were Hedgehogs, it follows that companies ought to act like Hedgehogs, pursuing one big thing.

One might counter that a Hedgehoglike focus is a risky but necessary gamble when striving for Greatness. We know, after all, that performance is relative, not absolute. Perhaps it makes sense to
follow a Hedgehog approach, because although the average result may be lower, the potential payoff of winning big is so much greater. That's a reasonable argument, and it could be correct. If that were
Collins's point, fine. But Collins does not argue that companies ought to adopt a Hedgehog focus in spite of its inherent risks. He does not suggest that the payoff of hitting it big is so great that companies
should accept a correspondingly higher risk of failure. Not at all. The overarching lesson of Good to Great is that any company can become Great if it is focused and persistent, that success is not a matter
of circumstance, and that the Buildup phase inexorably leads to Breakthrough. Nowhere does Good to Great talk about the need to take calculated but sometimes considerable risks, to pursue a course of
action that could lead to glory but even more likely lead to the gutter. Collins urges managers to be Hedgehogs by pointing out the upside while overlooking the attendant risks. Which is dangerous, be-

cause you can’t have it both ways.


=== 71.png ===
These errors aren't too surprising, given that Collins's understanding of the Fox-Hedgehog parable is questionable from the start. He suggests that people who have had the greatest impact on human-
ity—including Darwin, Marx, and Einstein—were Hedgehogs, consumed with a single and simple idea, then pursuing it with dogged focus. But Isaiah Berlin made no such claim, observing only that
Foxes and Hedgehogs were two different ways of looking at human experience. There have been great people in both categories. According to Berlin, Plato was a Hedgehog but Aristotle a Fox; Dante a
Hedgehog but Shakespeare a Fox; Dostoyevsky and Nietzsche were Hedgehogs while Goethe and Joyce were Foxes. Collins's assertion about Darwin is also doubtful: After all, Charles Darwin was raised
as a conventional Christian and arrived at his revolutionary ideas about natural selection after decades of careful observation and reflection—challenging conventional dogma is not the sort of thing a
Hedgehog normally does. It’s not even clear that Marx was a Hedgehog, as his favorite epigram—De omnibus disputandum (Everything must be doubted)—has a distinctly Foxlike ring. Many so-called

Marxists may be Hedgehogs, but of course that’s a different matter.

Delusion Nine: The Delusion of Organizational Physics

The emphasis on certainty, on clear causal relations rather than contingency and uncertainty, illuminates one final misconception. It pervades many of the business bestsellers that offer steps to
guaranteed success, but it’s most clearly seen in Good to Great. In the opening pages, Jim Collins describes his ambition: to discover “timeless, universal answers that can be applied by any organization.”

He writes:

While the practices of engineering continually evolve and change, the laws of physics remain relatively fixed. I like to think of our work as a search for timeless principles—the enduring physics of great
organizations—that will remain true and relevant no matter how the world changes around us. Yes, the specific application will change (the engineering), but certain immutable laws of organized

human performance (the physics) will endure.

The reference to physics is no accident. Of all the sciences, physics is the most elegant, the most sublime feat of pure intellect, the most able to reduce the workings of the universe to simple yet precise

mathematical equations. As physicist-turned-finance-expert Emanuel Derman explain:

“Theoretical physicists are accustomed to the success of mathematics in formulating the laws of the universe
and elaborating their consequences. The universe does indeed seem to run like some splendid Swiss clockwork: We can predict the orbits of planets and the frequency of light emitted by atoms to eight
or ten decimal places.” The prestige of physics is such that lesser mortals in biology and chemistry are said to suffer from “physics envy.” Comparing the study of business with the study of physics flat-
ters both the writer and the reader.

If the business world really did run with clocklike precision, then perhaps the promise of Good to Great would be reasonable. We can predict the movements of the planets, so why not the performance
of companies, too? Perhaps there really are universal principles of good management that can be applied by any company, at any time, in any industry. Small company or large? The laws of gravity surely
apply to them all. Incumbent or challenger? The same principles govern their motion. Growing rapidly or steady in size? Companies are all made of the same atoms. It’s an appealing image. In the words

of Fortune's resident wit, Stanley Bing, at the start of this chapter, we find the stately image of science to be reassuring. We like to believe that some cosmic order makes the business world a just and pre-

dictable place, ruled by precise laws. Yet as we saw in chapter 1, the most important questions in the business world don’t lend themselves to the predictability or replicability of physics. They never have

and never will, and for the reasons that Porras and Collins themselves admitted: We can’t put companies in petri dishes and run neat experiments. And since even the best studies of business, ones that


=== 72.png ===
carefully follow stringent research methods, ones that make sure to avoid Halos and that control for rival variables and make sure not to confuse correlation with causality, can never achieve the preci-

sion and replicability of physics, then all the claims of having isolated immutable laws of organizational performance are unfounded.

CHAPTER EIGHT

Stories, Science, and the Schizophrenic Tour de Force

We are story-telling creatures, products of history ourselves. We are fascinated by trends, in part because they tell stories by the basic device of imparting directionality to time, in part because they so
often supply a moral dimension to a sequence of events: a cause to bewail as something goes to pot, or to highlight as a rare beacon of hope. But our strong desire to identify trends often leads us to detect

a directionality that doesn’t exist, or to infer causes that cannot be sustained.

Stephen Jay Gould
Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin, 1996

Start with In Search of Excellence, draw a line to Built to Last, link it to What Really Works, and then extend it all the way to Good to Great. What pattern do we see when we connect these dots?

Each successive study made a bolder set of claims—to have gathered more data, to have consulted more experts, to have been more exhaustive in its research and more thorough in its analysis than
previous studies. Each one claimed to boldly go where no research had gone before, to do what had never been done, and to have a greater claim to the truth. By the time we get to the last two, there are
grandiose claims about virtual guarantees of success and immutable laws of physics. The one that started it all, Peters and Waterman's In Search of Excellence, seems almost modest by contrast, a quaint
throwback to a less pretentious age. But for all their claims of rigor and science, not one of these studies cracked the nut at the center of the puzzle. Not one of them recognized the central problem that
robs them of validity—namely, that by relying on articles from the popular press, on business school case studies, and on retrospective interviews, their data were compromised by the Halo Effect.

Yet for all their similarities, these books fared rather differently in the marketplace. In Search of Excellence was a huge success, as was Built to Last, while What Really Works was only moderately suc-
cessful. Why the difference? I suspect it’s not because of analytical rigor, because none of these studies is likely to win a blue ribbon at your local high school science fair. Rather, In Search of Excellence and
Built to Last were better stories. Their imagery was more compelling. Peters and Waterman gave us memorable phrases like a bias for action, sticking to the knitting, managing by wandering around, and
loose-tight coupling. Built to Last talked about big hairy audacious goals, clock building, the genius of the “and,” and cultlike cultures. These were memorable phrases that sparked curiosity and stimulated
discussion. By contrast, What Really Works relied on conventional terms like strategy, execution, culture, and structure. There was little original or engaging here, no surprising metaphors or captivating
images. The fact is, whatever their shortcomings may have been as researchers, Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, and Jim Collins and Jerry Porras, shared one great strength: They were terrific storytellers.

Because that’s really what we have here: stories that help managers make sense of their world, that direct their actions, and that give them confidence in the future.


=== 74.png ===
As for Good to Great, well, it was the best story of them all. Jim Collins's book was released with great fanfare in late 2001 and went straight to the top of the charts. Since then it has been a phenomenal
success, spending years on the New York Times Best-Seller List. By 2005, sales had passed 3 million copies and were still going strong. It’s not hard to see why. By its own description, Good to Great reads
“as well as a fast-paced novel.” It has engaging ideas, like Level-5 Leadership and the Stockdale Paradox. It offers intriguing metaphors like rinsing cottage cheese. It speaks of Hedgehogs and Foxes. It talks
about Flywheels and Doom Loops—we can almost feel the momentum as companies surge upward to glory or spiral downward to their death. Jim Collins wrote that one of his skills was finding patterns
in chaos, and he's right. In fact, Good to Great follows a form that’s rooted in a classic narrative structure. In The Seven Basic Plots, British author Christopher Booker identified a handful of plots that recur
in stories across cultures and eras. One of them goes by the name of Rags to Riches. Booker explained: “Few things have more consistently appealed to the fantasies of mankind than the dream of emerging
from obscurity to fame and fortune. We see it in people's perennial dream of having their humdrum lives miraculously transformed by a lottery win, or conceiving some idea that will bring fabulous
riches, or simply by being plucked out from the anonymous crowd to become the focus of attention or celebrity.” The Rags to Riches story almost always involves a humble character, unremarkable in any
way, who undergoes a series of adventures that brings about a miraculous transformation in fortunes. Examples go as far back as Joseph in the book of Genesis and include everything from the legend of
King Arthur pulling the sword from the stone, to Aladdin and the magic lamp, to Cinderella and her glass slipper, and of course to Shaw’s Pygmalion. Sound familiar? Start with a humble little firm,
preferably in a dowdy industry, then show how it became one of the great performers of its day thanks to persistence and honest effort, and you've got the basic ingredients of Good to Great. Collins didn’t
have to look far to find a proven archetype that taps into our fondest hopes. Why, even the title Good to Great is an echo of Rags to Riches. No wonder the book has been such a hit—it speaks to a perennial
dream and appeals to our deepest fantasies. None of which would matter much if the picture that Collins paints were accurate, if humility and persistence and focus do indeed lead to success with the
predictability of physics. But that’s not the case. And while most reviewers took Collins's work at face value—accepting its claims to be rigorous, scientific, and exhaustive—a few saw it for what it is: a
trip to feel-good fantasyland. George Anders of The Wall Street Journal wrote that Good to Great offered a picture of the business world somewhere between Norman Rockwell and Mister Rogers—a simple
and reassuring place of homespun values and old-fashioned virtues, where everyone feels safe and secure. In Mr. Collins's neighborhood, the simple story with the positive message is paramount. And if

that story could be made to look like rigorous science, well, it would be all the more convincing.

And the Hits Just Keep on Coming

The quest for the business Holy Grail didn’t end with Good to Great. There was no reason to imagine that Jim Collins would kill the genre—quite the contrary, the huge success of Good to Great would
likely lead to more books in the same vein, claiming to reveal the secrets of business success. The latest one to cross my desk, published in 2006, was called Big Winners and Big Losers: The 4 Secrets of
Long-Term Business Success and Failure. The author? Alfred Marcus, professor of strategy and technology at the University of Minnesota. The publisher? Wharton School Publishing. Cover endorsements?
Glowing praise from eminent business school professors at Dartmouth, Duke, Northwestern, and MIT. Why, it would be hard to imagine a book with better credentials.

Iopened the book wondering if someone finally got it right—if at last someone had cast aside business delusions in favor of a more sensible view of company performance. But it didn’t take long
to see that there's not much different here. The title, which claims to reveal the secrets of long-term success, is hardly an auspicious beginning. After that, the book offers a review of previous studies,

from Peters and Waterman, to Joyce, Nohria, and Roberson, and on to Jim Collins. According to Marcus, each of those studies contained a major flaw—each one erred by stressing the importance either


=== 75.png ===
of adaptability or of focus, but failed to show the importance of both at the same time. This study, he promises, will go a step better. It will show that the real secret to lasting success is the ability to be
adaptable and focused—and at the same time.

Mercifully, there are no claims of having discovered the laws of organizational physics. But after that, it’s déja vu all over again. Again, there's a claim of rigorous research—thousands of companies
studied carefully over ten years, 1992-2002. Once again, there's a sample of high performers and a sample of low performers, selected based on outcome. To study these companies, Marcus assigned
students in his part-time executive MBA program to conduct analyses, then used his students’ reports as his data. Now, there's nothing necessarily wrong with enlisting managers as researchers, pro-
vided their findings are based on valid data and of comparable quality. Managers aren’t necessarily less capable researchers than graduate students or professors themselves—in fact, managers may be
open to follow the facts where they find them and not shade their findings to support a preferred outcome. Rather, the question has to do with the quality of their data, and that’s where the problem lies.
‘What were the data for this study, said to be the product of rigorous analysis and careful detailed research? Most of it was based on the same flawed sources we've seen over and over—managers’ ex post
facto recollections, company statements, and articles from the business press. As for the “secrets of long-term success,” Marcus found that Big Winners had discovered an attractive industry position—
a sweet spot—and were well managed—they were adaptive, disciplined, and focused. The Big Losers? They were stuck in a sour spot and were rigid, inept, and diffuse. But as we know by now, a successful
company can always be described as disciplined while the same company, in times of trouble, can be seen as inept; companies that change successfully can always be described as adaptive while those
that don’t will naturally be seen as rigid. Unless those terms are defined in ways that aren't shaped by performance, all we're doing is stacking Halos. We're collecting attributions about successful and
unsuccessful companies but not identifying the drivers of success or failure. The effect, once again, is to tell managers that companies can succeed by following a simple formula, never mind what other
companies do. Nowhere is there an appreciation of the relative nature of performance, of the need for managers to take calculated risks if they hope to outdo their rivals. The years of study may change,
and the companies examined may be different, but the delusions remain the same.

Perhaps the most interesting finding in Big Winners and Big Losers is mentioned as a brief aside but not examined closely: Marcus points out that large companies show up more frequently among the
Big Losers, while almost all the Big Winners are small or midsize companies. This observation ought to spark one’s curiosity, because large companies got that way in the first place by doing things well
—they didn’t grow by being Losers—yet something seemed to prevent them from maintaining that high performance. Did they abandon their winning ways? Did they suffer from hubris? Or did they
continue to do largely the same things but, quite naturally, regressed to the mean as they got bigger, due mainly to the erosive effects of competitive pressures? Extreme performance, for better and
for worse, is more common among small companies. One company, in particular, might have caught Marcus's eye. One of the Losers, a low performer for the ten-year period of 1992-2002, was Camp-
bell Soup. Guess where Campbell Soup figured in What Really Works, the ten-year study by the Evergreen Project? For the years 1986-1996, it was listed among the Winners, having racked up strong
performance in both five-year blocks. Did Campbell Soup so quickly change its winning ways—did it foolishly venture into new markets or change the formula for its famous tomato soup? Or was its
performance eroded by market forces, improved competition, or changing customer tastes? What drove the lower performance of Campbell Soup isn't carefully explored; we're given only a collection of
attributions based on its lower performance, with predictable results. Regrettably, for all its claims to be new and improved, this latest effort to crack the code of business success has many of the same

flaws as its predecessors and comes no closer to offering a satisfying explanation of company performance.


=== 76.png ===
Good Science, Bad Stories?

Of course, not all that’s written about business and management works primarily at the level of storytelling. Many studies of company performance try hard to avoid the Halo Effect and other delusions.
They're carefully designed and well executed. One such study, by Marianne Bertrand at the University of Chicago and Antoinette Schoar at MIT, investigated whether company performance was affected
by the chief executive's personal managerial style. It's easy to find anecdotal evidence that CEOs of successful companies have effective personal styles—given the Halo Effect, that much is almost in-

evitable. But Bertrand and Schoar knew better than to gather cartons of magazine articles or to ask managers to rate the style of their chief executives—methods that would do little more than capture

Halos. Instead,

These policies were objective and measurable, not ambiguous and hard to define. Next, they gathered data from audited
financial statements so there could be little chance of a Halo Effect. As additional steps, they controlled for a number of other variables, and they also looked at the actions of specific managers over time,
examining their tenure at more than one company. This was good, solid social science research. And the results? Bertrand and Schoar found that individual managers indeed have preferred personal
styles when it comes to investment and financial policies, and that these preferences explain about 4 percent of the variance of company performance. In other words, after controlling for several other
factors, the impact of a manager’s personal style on company performance was about 4 percent. That’s a statistically significant finding, but it’s hardly a seductive story. You won't excite many managers
by saying: If you do these things, all else equal, you might improve company performance by about 4 percent. But rigorous science doesn’t always lead to a riveting story.

Here’s a second example. Nick Bloom at the London School of Economics and Stephen Dorgan at McKinsey set out to test the association between specific management practices and company perfor-
mance. It’s similar to the question Peters and Waterman asked—What leads to excellent performance?—and it’s also close to the Evergreen Project’s question—What really works? But Bloom and Dorgan
took a very different approach. Did they begin by selecting list of high performers, then look backward to see what they had in common? No, they began by selecting a wide sample of more than 700
medium-size manufacturing companies in Europe and the United States, a mix of high performers and low performers. Did they ask respondents to evaluate things like corporate culture or management
quality or customer orientation, all of which are likely to be shaped by performance? No, they asked managers to describe specific practices, wording their questions in such a way as to ensure the answers
were not colored by the Halo Effect. To further improve the validity of their data, they used a “double blind” method of gathering and coding the data: Respondents were told only that the research was
about practices, not that it was concerned with company performance; and the person who gathered the data did not know the performance of the company, removing a potential source of bias. Finally,
since the study gathered data at a single point in time—it was cross-sectional, not longitudinal—the authors were careful to point out they had found correlation only, not causality. They even suggested
that causality could run in the opposite direction—that is, high-performing companies might have the funds or resources to adopt certain management practices. They deliberately understated their
findings. So after all that, what did Bloom and Dorgan find? Their study showed that specific management practices were indeed associated with differences in performance and explained about 10
percent of the total variance in firm performance. That is, acompany that adopted the best practices across the boards—from manufacturing and customer service to human resource management and
finance—tended to outperform a laggard company by about 10 percent. That's a statistically significant result, and it’s a useful finding, but it falls far short of promising that a company that adopts a

given set of management practices will be successful. It’s good social science research—careful, clear, and rigorous—but it doesn’t claim to virtually guarantee anything.


=== 77.png ===
Both of these studies, and plenty more like them, meet the test of good science, but they don't exactly sizzle as stories. In fact, if the hallmark of a story is to provide some guidance for action, they’re
really not stories at all. To say that 700 companies showed, on average, a 10 percent difference in performance doesn’t say anything about what will happen at my company—the impact could be more
or less or nothing at all. There's no guarantee, no promise that inspires me to take action. Is it any wonder that more attention is paid to books that claim to reveal the secrets of high performance? Those
books provide simple and definitive advice, they help people make sense of a complex world, and they hold out the promise that humility and persistence lead to lasting success, that greatness beckons if
only one is patient and determined. The result, according to James March and Robert Sutton of Stanford University, is that studies of organizational performance stand in two very different worlds. The
first world speaks to practicing managers and rewards speculations about how to improve performance. Here we find studies whose main desire is to inspire and comfort. The second world demands
and rewards adherence to rigorous standards of scholarship. Here, science is paramount, storytelling less so. March and Sutton explain: “In its efforts to satisfy these often conflicting demands, the

organizational research community sometimes responds by saying that inferences about the causes of performance cannot be made from the data available, and simultaneously goes ahead to make

such inference.” The result is a “schizophrenic tour de fore

in which “the demands of the roles of the consultant and teacher are disassociated from the demands of the role of the researcher.” These two
worlds operate on different logics, follow different sets of rules, and speak to audiences with different needs, but they rarely intersect.

Two separate worlds operating on their own logic would be complicated enough, but what's going on is even more troublesome than that. Stories about company performance appear to be all the
more persuasive when they're dressed up to look like science, when they're said to be based on exhaustive research, backed up by cartons of documents and gigabytes of data, blessed by a roster of
experts from well-known universities, and claiming to reveal underlying principles with the accuracy of science. We're back to the Delusion of Rigorous Research. The bestsellers we've reviewed spent
considerable time discussing their methodology and data analysis, and reviewers and readers alike were hugely impressed by how extensive and exhaustive the research appeared to be. By now, of
course, we know that the data were flawed and that explanations of improved performance were highly questionable. Yet the rewards for an appealing story, made all the more impressive by claiming to
be science, are considerable. According to The Economist, Tom Peters can charge corporate clients up to $85,000 for a single appearance, and Jim Collins commands a fee of $150,000. There’s a lucrative
market for spinning stories of corporate success. Will anyone hire Bertrand and Schoar at $85,000 or $150,000 a pop to talk about a statistically significant 4 percent difference in performance? Some-
how it seems doubtful.

Chapter 1 borrowed a line from a Frank Sinatra song: “How little we know, how much to discover.” Yet if what's really vital is the ability to weave a compelling and inspiring tale, then perhaps scientific

rigor isn’t so important after all. Maybe the last lines of the song are the most revealing ones: “How little it matters, how little we know.”

Satisfying Stories or Dangerous Delusions?

One might imagine that a way forward is to reject stories and insist on a purely scientific approach to business and management. But I’m not so sure. Stories will always be with us. They’re an important
part of life, providing coherent explanations of complex events. They help people act by conferring a moral dimension to events. By offering what Stephen Jay Gould called “a rare beacon of hope,” stories
can inspire people to action. Some of the people I’ve enjoyed quoting, like Gould and Richard Feynman, were scientists, professors at universities. They could take their time and refine their research,
running additional experiments or gathering more data until they were satisfied with their answers. Managers, on the other hand, have to act. Endless debate about alternative courses of action can’t

be conducive to success when, as we know, performance is relative and companies that stand still are rarely successful. Another chief executive, Harry S. Truman, famously complained that he wanted


=== 78.png ===
one-armed advisers—he was tired of advisers who continually said, “on one hand. .. and on the other hand . ..” Executives have to act, which may be one reason the image of the Hedgehog, focusing on
one thing rather than having to know many things, is so appealing.
The test of a good story is not whether it is entirely, fully, scientifically accurate—by definition it won't be. Rather, the test of a good story is whether it leads us toward valuable insights, if it inspires

us toward helpful action, at least most of the time. By that yardstick, perhaps we should be more charitable about the popular business books we've reviewed here, because most return again and again

to the same fundamentals. From Tom Peters through Jim Collins, the same themes are sounded: Companies do well when managers live by deeply held values, pursue a clear vision, care about their
employees, focus on their customers, and strive for excellence. Surely it can’t be such a bad thing if a manager navigates by those few basic principles, can it? Surely a dose of Norman Rockwell optimism
can’t be harmful, can it?

And truth be told, I find a lot of good in these basic principles. In the 1980s, I worked for six years at Hewlett-Packard, a company that was featured prominently in In Search of Excellence and Built to
Last. Strongly shared values, empowered people, a culture of innovation—those were all bedrock principles at Hewlett-Packard, one of the most progressive and successful companies in American busi-
ness history. Furthermore, the chief executive I've admired most in my career is David Packard—a wise and pragmatic man, direct and unpretentious, committed to his company but also willing to serve
in government—indeed, an exemplar of what Jim Collins calls Level Five Leadership. So overall, I’m sympathetic to much of what these bestsellers have to say. Most companies can benefit from their
basic principles—and if the authors have been able to present them in a way that’s accessible and vivid, so that millions of managers read these ideas and take them to heart, perhaps that’s not such a bad
thing.

Yet there's a bit more to it. Our desire to tell stories, to provide a coherent direction to events, may also cause us to see trends that do not exist or infer causes incorrectly. We may ignore facts because
they don’t fit into our story. (In The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, John Ford’s 1962 elegy to the passing of the Old West, the editor of the local newspaper, The Shinbone Star, decides not to print a story
that would reveal who really shot the town villain. He explains: “This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend!” Well, many of the studies we've looked at do just that: They print
the legend, over and over, until we think it’s the truth.) Therefore, we need to ask whether stories about company performance, although comforting and in many ways good, might also be harmful. Do
they paint a simple picture when a more complex one would be more helpful? Because if that’s the case, we should be careful not to be seduced, however pleasant they may seem. So is there reason to be-
lieve that the delusions we've encountered in the previous chapters can be harmful? I suspect the answer is yes. Here's why.

The Delusion of Lasting Success promises that building an enduring company is not only achievable but a worthwhile objective. Yet companies that have outperformed the market for long periods of

time are not just rare, they are statistical artifacts that are observable only in retrospect.

The Delusion of Absolute Performance diverts our attention from the fact that success and failure always take place in a competitive environment. It may be comforting to believe that our success is

entirely up to us, but as the example of Kmart demonstrated, a company can improve in absolute terms and still fall further behind in relative terms. Success in business means doing things better than
rivals, not just doing things well. Believing that performance is absolute can cause us to take our eye off rivals and to avoid decisions that, while risky, may be essential for survival given the particular
context of our industry and its competitive dynamics.

The Delusion of the Wrong End of the Stick lets us confuse causes and effects, actions and outcomes. We may look at a handful of extraordinarily successful companies and imagine that doing what they
did can lead to success—when it might in fact lead mainly to higher volatility and a lower overall chance of success. Unless we start with the full population of companies and examine what they all did

—and how they all fared—we have an incomplete and indeed biased set of information.


=== 79.png ===
The Delusion of Organizational Physics implies that the business world offers predictable results, that it conforms to precise laws. It fuels a belief that a given set of actions can work in all settings and
ignores the need to adapt to different conditions: intensity of competition, rate of growth, size of competitors, market concentration, regulation, global dispersion of activities, and much more. Claiming
that one approach can work everywhere, at all times, for all companies, has a simplistic appeal but doesn’t do justice to the complexities of business.

These points, taken together, expose the principal fiction at the heart of so many business books—that a company can choose to be great, that following a few key steps will predictably lead to great-
ness, that its success is entirely of its own making and not dependent on factors outside its control. We're not far off from self-help books that tell people they can be millionaires in five easy steps, or lose
twenty pounds in two weeks, or awaken the power of greatness in them. Furthermore, if one accepts all of this, then the converse holds, too: If a company never becomes great, its managers must have
failed somewhere along the line. They must have disregarded the right steps or wavered from the true path. If greatness is within our power to achieve, then failure to become great is our responsibility,

too.

Lego, Redux

Which bring us back, once again, to Lego. Remember that in January 2004, after a dismal holiday season, Poul Plougmann was sacked, ousted, removed, and dismissed—and deservedly so, all the news-
papers told us, because Lego’s sales and profits had fallen sharply. The press explained that Lego had strayed from the core, which meant that Plougmann had blundered, which meant it was time for him
to go. The real question isn’t whether Lego had a bad year in 2003—we know that it did. The question we should ask is a different one: Did the company falter because of decisions taken by Plougmann
or because of other factors? Of course, it’s possible that he was an ineffective leader and that Lego would be better off without him. But it’s also possible that Lego’s situation was already grim, far above
Poul Plougmann’s poor powers to add or detract. Perhaps the company’s problems had to do with choices made long before Plougmann arrived in 1999, as his predecessors repeatedly failed to break out
ofa doomed niche, in effect staying too long in a narrow core. If that were so, then firing the manager might be little more than a knee-jerk reaction, a simplistic response to hold someone accountable,
but not a sound business decision. And Plougmann’s successor, instructed to go back to basics, might find himself with an even tougher job as Lego tries to reverse course once again. If the company
continues to flounder and the new executive is eventually dismissed or canned or replaced, one day someone will write that Lego, just like Kmart, made the classic errors: It shifted its strategy, it failed to
execute, it had a slow culture, and it suffered from a cumbersome organization.

Just for the record, what happened to Lego after Poul Plougmann was fired? Lego’s sales continued to decline, from 6.8 billion kroner in 2003 to 6.3 billion kroner in 2004. Operating losses continued
for another year. Then a new chief executive turned his attention to cutting costs. In 2005, Lego sold its Legoland amusement parks and began to reduce its manufacturing activities in Denmark,
Switzerland, and the United States, shifting capacity to low-cost countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. More than 1,200 jobs were lost, a 20 percent drop in employees. The result? By 2005, Lego was back
in the black. However, this was mainly the outcome of a drastic and painful reduction in expenses, not because it had found a way to generate profitable growth in its core. Would Lego have done better
or worse had Plougmann remained in charge? I can’t say, and I’m not sure that anyone can. We can’t turn back the clock, change one variable, and then run the experiment again. Assessing the perfor-
mance of a chief executive doesn’t easily lend itself to scientific experimentation. But my guess is that Lego’s problems went well beyond the short tenure of any single executive. It's easy to blame one

man for a company’s woes, but these sorts of attributions, while appealing for their simplicity, may not provide the best basis on which to manage a company.

CHAPTER ONE

How Little We Know

How little we know, how much to discover...
Who cares to define what chemistry this is?

Who cares, with your lips on mine, how ignorant bliss is?

“How Little We Know (How Little It Matters)”
Words by Carolyn Leigh, music by Philip Springer, 1956

In January 2004, after a particularly disastrous holiday season, Lego, the Danish toy company, fired its chief operating officer. No one doubted that Poul Plougmann had to go. Miserable Christmas sales
were the last straw at the end of a terrible year—Lego’s revenues were down by 25 percent, and the company lost $230 million for the year, the worst in its history. What went so badly wrong? Chief ex-
ecutive Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, grandson of the founder, explained it simply: Lego had “strayed too far from its roots and relied too heavily on merchandising spin-offs, such as Harry Potter figures, which
proved unpopular this season despite the continuing success of J. K. Rowling’s books.” The solution? Lego announced that it would “return to basics.” Kristiansen vowed: “We will focus on profitability,
especially the attractive potential of our core products.”

There's nothing especially remarkable about a story like this. Every day we read about companies that are doing well and someone gets promoted, and other companies that fail and someone gets the
ax, Today it’s Lego, and tomorrow it'll be someone else. The beat goes on.

Now, I'm really not very interested in Lego. As Rick might have said in Casablanca, the problems of one family-owned Danish toy maker don’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. What does
interest me is how we explain Lego's performance, because the way we think about what happened at Lego is typical of how we think about success or failure in countless other companies. We don’t
want to read just that Lego’s sales were sharply down, we want an explanation of what happened. It can’t just have been bad luck—there must have been some reason why a proud company, a fixture on
toy store shelves all around the world, a faithful playtime companion to generations of children, suddenly did so badly. So how did the business press explain Lego’s downfall? A few newspapers reported

that Lego was hurt by the fall of the U.S. dollar against the Danish kroner, which meant that North American sales—about half of Lego's total—were worth less on Legos books. Some reporters also noted

CHAPTER NINE

The Mother of All Business Questions, Take Two

The job of supposed intellectuals is to combat oversimplification or reductionism and to say, well, actually, it's more complicated than that. At least that's part of the job. However, you must have noticed
how often certain complexities are introduced as a means of obfuscation. Here it becomes necessary to ply with glee the celebrated razor of old Occam, dispose of unnecessary assumptions, and pro-

claim that, actually, things are less complicated than they appear.

Christopher Hitchens

Letters to a Young Contrarian, 2001

Exposing delusions that cloud our thinking about company performance is essential for discerning managers, but it’s not entirely satisfying, because it doesn’t answer the mother of all business
questions: What leads to high performance? In fact, it may seem as if we've been going backward. We may seem to know even less than we did at the start of this book. Does employee satisfaction lead to
high performance? Probably, but it’s hard to say how much, and it turns out the reverse effect is stronger: Company performance is a more important determinant of employee satisfaction. Well then, a
strong corporate culture leads to high performance, right? Managers should strive to build strong values that are shared by all, shouldn't they? Perhaps, but just how much culture affects performance is
hard to say, and once again the reverse effect may be greater, as successful companies are usually said to have strong cultures. What about customer focus? Isn't it vital for companies to be close to their
customers? Yes, but if we're not careful, just about any high-performing company can be said to have good customer focus, and any company with sluggish sales or falling margins can be said to have
lost its way with customers. Leadership isn’t a more satisfying explanation, either, because we can always claim that successful companies have effective leaders, who seem to be endowed with clear vi-
sion and good communication skills; and we can always say that the leader of a failing company somehow lost the plot.

But all of this begs a deeper question: If so many of the things we observe are not drivers of performance but attributions based on performance, then what brought about high performance in the first
place? We may agree with George Bernard Shaw that the difference between a lady and a flower girl isn’t how she acts but how she’s treated, but that doesn’t explain how she came to bea lady to begin
with. To say she was born into a wealthy family only pushes the question back a generation—how, we should want to know, did her family become wealthy while another did not? So we have to return to
the question that started it all: What leads to high performance?

If we believe management gurus and consultants and many business school professors, high performance can be achieved with enough care and attention to a precise set of elements—these four

factors or those six steps or these eight principles. Do those things, and success is just around the corner. But to paraphrase Christopher Hitchens, all the emphasis on steps and formulas may obscure a


=== 81.png ===
more simple truth. It may further the fiction that a specific set of steps will lead, predictably, to success. And if you never achieve greatness, well, the problem isn’t with our formula—which was, after
all, the product of rigorous research, of extensive data exhaustively analyzed—but with you and your failure to follow the formula. But in fact, the truth may be considerably simpler than these formulas
suggest. They may divert our attention from a more powerful insight—that while we can do many things to improve our chances of success, at its core business performance retains a large measure of
uncertainty. Business performance may actually be simpler than it is often made out to be, but may also be less certain and less amenable to engineering with predictable outcomes.

Here's the way I like to think about company performance. According to Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, company performance is driven by two things: strategy and execution. Strategy is
about performing different activities from those of rival companies, or performing similar activities in different ways. A strategy is not a goal or an objective or a target. It's not a vision or mission or a
statement of purpose. It’s about being different from rivals in some important way. In turn, execution is all about carrying out those choices. It refers to the way that people, working together in an orga-
nizational setting, mobilize resources to deliver on the strategy. Building high-quality products, providing customer service, managing working capital, developing and deploying talent—these usually
aren't matters of strategy because almost every company wants to do these things well. Rather, these things are the stuff of day-to-day management. They’re all about effective operations. Explaining
high performance in terms of just two things—strategy and execution—may at first raise our hopes. Just two items rather than some lengthy list! Surely managers ought to be able to get two things

right! But a closer look shows that both are fraught with uncertainty, and makes plain why all the talk about blueprints and guarantees and immutable laws is a delusion.

The Risky Business of Strategic Choice...

All companies face a handful of basic strategic choices. In what products and markets shall we compete? What activities shall we perform—and what shall we decide to leave to suppliers or partners?
How shall we position ourselves against our rivals—shall we take a premium position, or shall we be known for low cost? These are choices in the sense that a company can’t hope to be all things to all
customers at all times, but has to choose to compete in this product line and not in that one; to enter this market and stay out of that one; to perform these activities but not those; and to position itself
relative to competitors in this way but not that one. These sorts of choices aren't bland statements of aspiration, but fundamental decisions that set a company apart from its rivals. And choosing to be
different implies risk.

You wouldn’t appreciate the risky nature of strategic choice if you read most business books. For example, the Evergreen Project advised companies to “devise and maintain a clearly stated, focused
strategy.” The exact nature of that strategy wasn’t important. If a company desires to grow, the authors explained, “it doesn’t matter how you achieve this growth. You can do it by organic expansion,

mergers and acquisitions, or a combination of both.” They went on: “Whatever your strategy, whether it is low prices or innovative products, it will work if it is sharply defined, clearly communicated,

and well understood by employees, customers, partners, and investors.” Which is, of course, sheer nonsense. It may be true that if we pick a group of highly successful companies, we can find some that
grew by organic expansion and others by acquisition, some that offered low prices and others that emphasized innovation, but it doesn’t follow that one strategy is just as good as another provided

it’s well-defined and clearly communicated. All we've done is grab the wrong end of the stick. In a given market setting, some choices may be foolish, even suicidal. Try, for example, pursuing capacity
expansion in an industry that already has overcapacity—that's rarely a wise move, and even the best communication and sharpest definition won't help. Likewise, Good to Great underplayed the risky

nature of strategic choice. At the outset, Collins wrote: “We expected that good-to-great leaders would begin by setting a new vision and strategy.” Instead, his team found that successful companies first

assembled a team of great people, and a successful strategy followed. Great companies got “the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats—and then


=== 82.png ===
figured out where to drive it.” That’s the extent of attention paid to strategic choice in Good to Great. There's nothing about competitors or positioning or risk. Strategy isn’t even a topic that's listed in the
index.

Neither of these books recognized a central fact: Strategy always involves risk because we don’t know for sure how our choices will turn out. There are several reasons why strategic decisions are so un-
certain. A first reason has to do with customers. Will customers embrace or reject a new product or service? How much will they be willing to pay? It’s hard to tell for sure. Market research is often useful,
and as we said with regard to Harrah's in chapter 1, some businesses lend themselves to scientific experimentation—they offer natural laboratories where variations can be tested in carefully controlled
settings. But many major initiatives, like the launch of a new product or a new business model, don’t easily lend themselves to experiments. There are, in fact, legendary examples where mountains of
market research didn’t help at all. Sam Phillips, the legendary Sun Records producer, once cautioned: “Any time you think you know what the public's going to want, that’s when you know you're looking
at a damn fool when you're looking in the mirror.” Market reaction is always uncertain, and smart strategists know it.

A second source of risk has to do with competitors. Even if we can accurately predict what customers will do, we still have to contend with rivals, some of whom have made equally good predictions
about customers and may pursue a similar set of choices—or may leapfrog us entirely with a revolutionary product or service. Predicting a rival’s moves is hardly an exact science—especially when that
rival is also trying to predict our behavior. An entire branch of economics, game theory, has grown up around a simple form of competitive intelligence that involves just two players, called the Prisoner's
Dilemma. Expand the game to include multiple players, each with somewhat different resources and capabilities and risk preferences, and the complexity of the game grows in exponential leaps.

A third source of risk comes from technological change. Some industries are relatively stable, with products that don’t change much and customer demand that remains steady for long periods of
time. If you're Kellogg’s and you sell cornflakes, you might be able to crank out a steady profit year after year. People still need to eat breakfast, no one has invented a much better cornflake, and you have
a well-known brand, all of which may translate into steady revenues and profits (at least until generic cornflakes and private labels erode market share and margins or until large retailers squeeze our
profits—nothing is forever, as Schumpeter would tell us). But in other industries, technology changes rapidly and strategic choices can come one after another with life-and-death consequences. In his
groundbreaking research, Clayton Christensen at Harvard Business School showed that in a wide range of industries, from earth-moving equipment to disk drives to steel, successful companies were
repeatedly dislodged by new technologies. They didn’t fail because they were badly managed—the problem was more insidious than that. Rather, it was because they kept doing everything right—they
focused on the needs of their customers and invested in new products that had a high likelihood of success—that they became vulnerable to new technologies. These so-called disruptive technologies at
first didn’t look attractive to established players—they didn’t meet the needs of existing customers and didn’t promise substantial sales—and therefore tended to be ignored, yet they improved over time
and eventually displaced the existing technology, spelling disaster for market leaders. It is, after all, very hard to know which new technologies will lead nowhere and can be safely ignored, and which
will transform the industry and pose a mortal threat.

‘Add together these three factors—uncertain customer demand, unpredictable competitors, and changing technology—and it becomes clear why strategic choice is inherently risky. And nowhere
have the risks been higher than in high-technology industries. Remember in chapter 7 when Jim Collins expressed surprise that the eleven Great companies came from ordinary, unspectacular indus-
tries like consumer retailing, consumer products, financial services, and steel? He offered a powerful implication: You don’t have to be a glossy high-tech or biotech company to become Great. If these run-
of -the-mill companies can become Great, well, then so can you! But I suspect a different interpretation is more accurate. These industries can be described as dowdy, but a better word might be stable. They
were less subject to radical changes in technology, were less susceptible to shifts in customer demand, and may have had less intense competition. All of which meant that companies in these industries
had a better chance of racking up consistent performance, year after year, than did companies in more turbulent industries. High tech companies, by contrast, were much less likely to string together

fifteen years of high performance. Among the thirty-five darlings of corporate America featured in In Search of Excellence were several high-tech companies: computer makers Amdahl, Data General,


=== 83.png ===
Digital Equipment, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Wang Labs, plus semiconductor firms like Intel, National Semiconductor, and Texas Instruments. In the ten years after the study ended, not one of them
kept pace with the overall market, as shown on table 1A in the appendix. Not one. It makes a wonderful story to claim that anyone can become Great, but the only companies that met Collins's criteria of
fifteen years above the market average happened to be active in consumer products like cigarettes and razor blades and toilet paper, or consumer retailing like drugstores, or financial services like retail
banks and mortgages. Collins remarked that companies can become Great even in unlikely places, but a fresh look at the evidence suggests that he got it backward. If the criterion is fifteen consecutive
years of high performance, it may be more accurate to say that only companies in stable industries are likely to achieve Greatness.

A final source of risk comes not from all the things outside the company—customers, rivals, and technologies—but from uncertainties surrounding internal capabilities. The fact is, managers can’t
tell exactly how their company—with its particular people and skills and experiences—will respond to a new course of action. Strategy professors describe this with the phrase “causal ambiguity,”
meaning that the many and subtle interrelationships inside a company make it hard to know exactly what will be the outcome of a given set of actions. Take all of these together, and the inherent riski-
ness of strategic choice is clear.

What should a manager do in the face of all this uncertainty? Is it better to take a Foxlike view of the world and ceaselessly factor in a wide range of information, making adjustments and shifting

plans accordingly? Or is better to pursue Hedgehoglike simplicity and focus? The latter is certainly easier to explain to employees and easier for them to follow with confidence. And, according to some,
it may also be more effective. Peters and Waterman spoke about the value of sticking to the knitting; the Evergreen Project emphasized the importance of a clearly stated, sharply focused strategy; and
Collins's eleven Great companies were all said to have a Hedgehoglike focus. And they're not alone. In a study that I mentioned briefly in chapter 1, Chris Zook of Bain & Co looked at 1,854 companies over
ten years and found that of those companies that had achieved high performance—defined as sustained, profitable growth—fully 78 percent had focused on one core business. The implication: Companies
that focus on their core outperform those that do not. But let’s be careful. It may be true that 78 percent of high-performing companies had a single core business, but it doesn’t follow that having a single
core improves your chances of success, because we don’t know the proportion of companies in the total population that had one core versus those that had more. We need to make sure we grab the right
end of the stick. The key question is not how many successful companies have a focused profile; rather, it’s whether companies with a focused profile are more likely to be successful. A change in strategy
might not be the cause of bad performance as much as the result, since companies normally stick with a winning formula. A more interesting question, which so far hasn’t been answered, goes like this:
What should a company do when its core comes under pressure? Will it improve its chances of success by becoming more Hedgehoglike, by redoubling its focus on a narrow core? Or will it benefit from
Foxlike improvisation and adaptation? That’s a tougher question, but it’s one that managers face in their daily jobs. It’s the question that Nokia faced in chapter 1 when its handsets came under pressure
from new rivals, and it’s also the question Lego faced as demand for traditional toys faltered. So far, there's little conclusive research on the subject, perhaps because the question cannot be answered by
taking a long sweep of time and looking at overall patterns. The question has to be studied in a different way, isolating specific moments of decision and comparing the fortunes of companies that
followed different paths. As of now, we have little in the way of persuasive answers to this question.

In the meantime, we're left with the brutal fact that strategic choice is hugely consequential for a company’s performance yet also inherently risky. We may look at successful companies and applaud
them for what seem, in retrospect, to have been brilliant decisions, but we forget that at the time those decisions were made, they were controversial and risky. McDonald’s bet on franchising looks smart
today, but in the 1950s it was a leap in the dark. Dell’s strategy of selling direct now seems brilliant but was attempted only after multiple failures with conventional channels. Or, recalling companies
we discussed in earlier chapters, remember Cisco's decision to assemble a full range of product offerings through acquisitions or ABB's bet on leading rationalization of the European power industry
through consolidation and cost cutting. The managers who took those choices appraised a wide variety of factors and decided to be different from their rivals. We remember all of these decisions be-

cause they turned out well, but success was not inevitable. As James March of Stanford and Zur Shapira of New York University explained, “Post hoc reconstruction permits history to be told in such a


=== 84.png ===
way that ‘chance, either in the sense of genuinely probabilistic phenomena or in the sense of unexplained variation, is minimized as an explanation.” But chance does play a role, and the difference be-
tween a brilliant visionary anda foolish gambler is usually inferred after the fact, an attribution based on outcomes. The fact is, strategic choices always involve risk. The task of strategic leadership is to

gather appropriate information and evaluate it thoughtfully, then make choices that, while risky, provide the best chances for success in a competitive industry setting.

... And the Uncertainties of Execution

In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the second pillar of company performance, execution. A few prominent business leaders have trumpeted its importance. In the view of Larry
Bossidy, former head of Honeywell and before that a senior executive at General Electric, execution isn’t merely one of the important elements of company performance, but ranks right at the top. “Exe-

cution,”

he wrote, “is the great unaddressed issue in the business world today. Its absence is the single biggest obstacle to success and the cause of the disappointments that are mistakenly attributed to
other causes. No strategy can deliver results unless it’s converted into specific actions—and those specific actions are the stuff of execution.” That might seem like good news, because if execution is not
only very important, but also involves less uncertainty than strategic choice, then perhaps managers can make predictable improvements to company performance after all. And it is true that execution
isn'tas risky as strategic choice, and for an obvious reason. Strategic choice depends on customer preferences and the actions of competitors and the prospects of some new technology—all of which are

in the messy world outside. By contrast, execution takes place entirely within the company. It happens on our premises, with our people, working together to achieve an agreed-upon strategy that we

formulated. There are fewer unknowns.

Yet execution still involves a number of uncertainties. After all,
Some technical elements can often be copied and applied with predictable results.
For example, manufacturing methods, production formulas, inventory management, and computer systems can often be shared across business units with similar effect. But when we begin to examine
how those technical systems interact with social systems, with people and values and attitudes and expectations, the results are harder to predict. Take, as an example, human resources management
practices. Mark Huselid and Brian Becker, authors of a study we read about in chapter 5, found that human resource management systems have an important impact on company performance and
concluded that managers would be well-advised to identify leading HR practices and apply them to their company. But they warned that what works at one organization, with its people and norms and
traditions, may not lead to the same result in another. The way human resource policies affect performance reflects an “idiosyncratic contingency.” Effective execution remains uncertain.
“Idiosyncratic contingency” is a bit like “causal ambiguity”—it’s how a PhD says “I don’t know.” But it's the truth. Despite our best efforts, the ways that people and processes work together in complex
organizations are very hard to untangle and even harder to transplant elsewhere with the same results. Even if we set out with the best of intentions to improve operational effectiveness, we can never
predict exactly how a given set of practices will shape a company’s performance. Which helps explain why the explanatory power of the study by Nick Bloom and Stephen Dorgan, reviewed in the previ-
ous chapter, was rather modest. They found that adopting certain business practices could explain about 10 percent of the variance in company performance. Why not more than 10 percent? Because
those same practices will lead to somewhat different results depending on a whole host of factors: an organization's people, their skills, their expectations, and the organizational context in which those

practices are used. None of this suggests that some practices aren't, on balance, better than others, nor does it mean that they won’t be generally useful for most companies much of the time. It means


=== 85.png ===
only that execution, like strategy, doesn’t lend itself to predictable cause-and-effect relationships. Our best efforts to isolate and understand the inner workings of organizations will be moderately suc-
cessful at best.

Given its importance as a contributor to company performance, it’s good that execution has received a growing amount of attention. Countless books and articles now talk about the need to get things
done. A phrase we hear over and over is “flawless execution.” One of the four elements in What Really Works used exactly this term: Successful companies were said to “develop and maintain flawless
operational execution.” A recent book titled Flawless Execution claimed to offer companies a way to achieve peak performance and “win their battles of the business world.” Business Week used the same
phrase to describe the challenges facing Nissan in its battle with Toyota: “Nissan's execution must be flawless.” All of this ought to be a good thing—not just to recognize the importance of operational
effectiveness, but to set the target high, to talk about flawless execution.

Yet in my experience, good intentions about execution are often undermined by a few basic errors. Let me explain. Recently I attended a presentation by a senior executive of a well-known multina-
tional company who spoke to forty of his managers from around the world. The company is a high performer, a leader in its industry, not a troubled firm. At the beginning of his talk, as he described the
challenges facing the company, the executive said emphatically: “We have the right strategy. We just need to execute better.” Everyone in the room nodded in agreement, and the discussion moved on,
covering a wide range of topics over the next hour. What could be wrong with that? Only this: There are dozens of dimensions of execution, and the forty people in the room may well have been thinking
about forty different things. When the session ended, they had no greater understanding of the most difficult challenges facing their company, nor were they any closer to agreement on specific actions
that they should take—which made it unlikely that much would change for the better. Saying, “We need to execute better,” is about as helpful as saying, “Let’s all doa better job.” It’s just motherhood and

apple pie.

Rather than merely state the importance of flawless execution—after all, who could be against flawless execution?—managers would do better to identify those few elements of execution that are

most important to deliver on the chosen strategy. For one company, it could be the reduction of manufacturing cycle time. Or lowering defect levels. For another, it could be improving speed to market

for new products. Or achieving higher levels of customer retention. Or improving the rate of on-time delivery. Of course, it’s tempting to say that everything is important, but that’s too easy. The key is to

And it can be done. When Larry Bossidy was CEO of AlliedSignal, he didn't just talk about the importance of execution in a general
way, he focused attention on four specific dimensions: accelerating new product development, improving the order-fill rate, superior inventory management, and better working capital management. It
was a short list that everyone in the company could understand and everyone could focus on.

Asecond challenge is our old friend, the Halo Effect. If we're not careful, any successful company can be said to execute well, and any failure can be explained, after the fact, as a failure to execute. By
now, we know how to avoid Halos—we have to rely on measures that aren't shaped by performance. We have to separate inputs from outcomes. For the last decade, Dell Inc. has been a leading example
of great execution. While it’s natural to look at Dell’s success and make an attribution of outstanding execution, a closer look makes clear that Dell rigorously measured many aspects of its operations,
from the speed of its build-to-order production process, to its ability to squeeze time out of every step of the production cycle, to its superior inventory turnover (more than eighty times per year!). Dell
also collected money from its customers before it paid suppliers—meaning, in accounting terms, that it had negative days of working capital, a rather remarkable achievement. Dell didn’t just talk about
the importance of flawless execution, it focused on a number of key elements and then measured them with precision. And the results have been, objectively measured, superb.

There's another reason I question the value of broad pronouncements about flawless execution—which is that it can divert attention from strategy. Remember when all forty managers nodded in

agreement at the importance of execution? Of course they did—who could disagree? But by putting the attention on execution, the topic of strategic choice was neatly sidestepped. This happens all the


=== 86.png ===
time. When my old company, Hewlett-Packard, announced disappointing results in August 2004, CEO Carly Fiorina stated, “The strategy is the right one. What we failed to do is execute the strategy.”
Her explanation sounded reasonable, and no one questioned her when she swiftly replaced a few key executives—it looked like an appropriate step to improve execution and raise company performance.
Curiously, when Fiorina herself was fired just six months later in February 2005, a company spokesperson repeated the same line: HP was following the right strategy, but the chief executive was replaced
because the board of directors wanted better execution! Again, it all sounded reasonable, and no alarms were raised about the company’s basic choices. Six weeks later, when Mark Hurd was hired as the
new CEO, Hewlett-Packard stuck to its message, announcing that it had “picked Mr. Hurd because of his execution skills.” And therein lies the problem: It’s always easier to bang the drum about execution
than to address fundamental questions of strategy. It’s always easier to insist we're going in the right direction but just need to run a little faster; it’s far more painful to admit that the direction may be
flawed, because the remedies are much more consequential. On closer inspection, Hewlett-Packard was beset on all sides by strategic worries. It enjoyed a strong position in printing and imaging prod-
ucts, but in personal computers it was locked in a losing battle with Dell; in corporate computers it was squeezed between Dell and IBM; in corporate data storage systems it trailed EMC; its information
technology services lagged behind IBM, Accenture, and EDS; and in consumer electronics, HP faced a range of tough competitors from Kodak to Sony. In fact, there were plenty of reasons to question HP’s
strategy, but doing so raised serious issues that had far-reaching consequences. Managers quite naturally find it easier to keep the attention on execution, which everyone will always agree can be done
better. And not even Dell is exempt: When it announced disappointing quarterly results in mid-2005, CEO Kevin Rollins explained away the problems as an “execution issue.” In fact, there were ample
reasons to question Dell's strategic choices regarding target markets and competitive positioning, but those discussions invariably have more troubling implications. It’s far simpler to point the finger at
And that brings us to the best answer I can provide to the question What leads to high performance? If we set aside the usual suspects of leadership and culture and focus and so on—which are perhaps

better understood as attributions based on performance rather than causes of performance—we're left with two broad categories: strategic choice and execution. The former is inherently risky since it’s

based on our best guesses about customers, about competitors, and technology, as well as about our internal capabilities. The latter is uncertain because practices that work well in one company may
not have the same effect in another. In spite of our desire for simple steps, the reality of management is much more uncertain than we would often like to admit—and much more so than our comforting
stories would have us believe. Wise managers know that business is about finding ways to improve the odds of success—but never imagine that success is certain. If acompany makes strategic choices
that are shrewd, works hard to operate effectively, and is favored by Lady Luck, it may put some distance between itself and its rivals, at least for a time. But even those profits will tend to erode over time.
Success at one moment doesn’t ensure success in the next moment, because success invites new challengers, some of them willing to take greater risks than the incumbents. All of which helps explain
why, seductive stories notwithstanding, there’s simply no formula that can guarantee success. As Tom Peters observed: “To be excellent, you have to be consistent. When you're consistent, you're vul-

nerable to attack. Yes, it’s a paradox. Now deal with it.”

CHAPTER TEN

Managing Without Coconut Headsets

Once you've internalized the concept that you can't prove anything in absolute terms, life becomes all the more about odds, chances, and trade-offs. In a world without provable truths, the only way to

refine the probabilities that remain is through greater knowledge and understanding.

Robert E, Rubin
Inan Uncertain World: Tough Choices from Wall Street to Washington, 2003

It’s no wonder that managers, under pressure to deliver ever higher revenues and profits, are attracted to books that claim to reveal the secrets of success. Even some well-known business leaders occa-
sionally look to bestsellers for help. In September 2005, Business Week wrote about Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer and his efforts to fend off challengers like Google and Yahoo!, to reinvigorate
the company and return Microsoft to its former greatness. Among other things, Ballmer was said to have looked for inspiration to Jim Collins's Good to Great.

Now, Steve Ballmer is a smart fellow and I don’t imagine he seriously thought that Collins’s book held many answers for Microsoft. The problems facing the world’s leading software company asit tries
to maintain a dominant position in a highly dynamic industry, with challenges ranging from open-source software to a blizzard of online innovations with names like wikis and blogs and mash-ups,
are light-years away from the problems that face midsize companies in consumer finance or retailing. But if Ballmer had tried to implement Collins's self-described immutable laws, he would have been
disappointed: Since he became CEO, Microsoft’s annual revenue growth fell from 36 percent to 8 percent and its stock price dropped by 40 percent. None of that should be very surprising. We know that
high-performing companies usually fall back over time because of competitive forces. The core ideas in Good to Great—have great people, stay focused, and be persistent—are probably helpful for many
companies in many circumstances, but there's no reason to believe they’re sufficient to restore a mammoth software company to its glory days.

Unfortunately for Ballmer and every other manager, there's no magic formula, no way to crack the code, no genie in the bottle holding the secrets to success. The answer to the question What really
works? is simple: Nothing really works, at least not all the time. That’s not the nature of the business world. But that insight, however accurate, isn’t of much comfort. Management is about taking action,
about doing things. So what can be done? A first step is to set aside the delusions that color so much of our thinking about business performance. To recognize that stories of inspiration may give us com-
fort but have little more predictive power than a pair of coconut headsets on a tropical island. Instead, managers would do better to understand that business success is relative, not absolute, and that

competitive advantage demands calculated risks. To accept that few companies achieve lasting success, and that those that do are perhaps best understood as having strung together several short-term


=== 88.png ===
successes rather than having consciously pursued enduring greatness. To admit that, as Tom Lester of the Financial Times so neatly put it, “the margin between success and failure is often very narrow,
and never quite as distinct or as enduring as it appears at a distance.” By extension, to recognize that good decisions don’t always lead to favorable outcomes, that unfavorable outcomes are not always
the result of mistakes, and therefore to resist the natural tendency to make attributions based solely on outcomes. And finally, to acknowledge that luck often plays a role in company success. Successful
companies aren't “just lucky”—high performance is not purely random—but good fortune does play a role, and sometimes a pivotal one.

If all of this seems discouraging, it need not. The fact that business performance depends on so many things outside our control is no cause for despair. And fortunately, there are several good exam-
ples of managers who see the world clearly, accurately, without delusions. They don’t write self-congratulatory accounts of their victorious careers or offer platitudes about authenticity and integrity

and humility, as if those things—important though they may be—were sufficient to guarantee success. They don’t cling to an idealized view of the business world. Rather, they are thoughtful managers

who recognize that
The executives we'll look at—Robert Rubin, Andy Grove, and Guerrino de Luca—have all been very successful, so it may seem that I’m selecting
my sample based on outcomes, and to some extent that’s true. We wouldn't know of them if they hadn’t enjoyed some success. But I feature them here not for their successes—for the outcomes—but for
the way they made decisions, for how they managed their companies, the way they made risky strategic choices with eyes wide open and then pushed for great execution. That sort of approach is an ex-

ample to managers everywhere.

Robert Rubin and the Management of Probabilities

Robert Rubin is perhaps best known for his eight years in the Clinton administration, first as director of the White House National Economic Council and later as secretary of the Treasury. Before that,
Rubin spent twenty-six years at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, eventually serving as co-senior partner. In his memoirs, Rubin described: “What has guided my career in both business and gov-
ernment is my fundamental view that nothing is provably certain. One corollary of this view is probabilistic decision making. Probabilistic thinking isn’t just an intellectual construct for me, but a habit
and discipline deeply rooted in my psyche.” It was a view first developed in college, where he studied philosophy and learned never to take propositions at face value, but to approach what he read and
heard with a skeptical mind. Rubin's thinking was further honed on Wall Street, where he saw there were no sure things, no formulas for success. Rather, “success came by evaluating all the information
available to try to judge the odds of various outcomes and the possible gains and losses associated with each. My life on Wall Street was based on probabilistic decisions I made on a daily basis.”

‘Many of Rubin's years at Goldman Sachs were spent in the field of risk arbitrage, which involves buying securities that are subject to a major event—a merger, for example, or a divestiture or a bank-
ruptcy. It was highly complicated but also, if done well, highly profitable. Make the right bet and you come out far ahead. Make the wrong bet and whoosh, all gone. Risk arbitrage didn’t lend itself to exact
calculations but always involved a measure of risk. As Rubin recalled: “Flux and uncertainty made risk arbitrage quite nerve-racking for some people. But somehow or other, I was able to take it in rea-

sonable stride. Arbitrage suited me, not only temperamentally but as a way of thinking—a kind of mental discipline. . . . Risk arbitrage sometimes involved taking large losses, but if you did your analysis

properly and didn’t get swept up into the psychology of the herd, you could be successful. Intermittent losses—sometimes greatly in excess of your worst-case expectations—were a part of the business.”
One memorable deal was the proposed 1967 acquisition by Becton Dickinson ofa rival company in the medical products industry, Univis. Under the terms of the stock-swap merger, one share of Univis

would rise from its current market price of $24 1/2 to about $33. When the deal was announced, Univis shares rose partway, from $24 1/2 to $30 1/2, reflecting the market's uncertainty about whether


=== 89.png ===
the deal would come to pass. That was the question Rubin's department had to answer. If Goldman Sachs believed the merger would succeed, it would buy Univis at $30 1/2 and enjoy the further rise to
$33; but if it expected the deal to fall through, it might sell Univis short. After much calculation, Goldman Sachs bought shares in Univis. It stood to gain $125,000 if the merger went through, a tidy
chunk of change in 1967. But some weeks later, a disappointing earnings report at Univis caused Becton Dickinson to withdraw its bid, and Goldman Sachs ended up losing $675,000—more than five
times what it had hoped to gain. Naturally there was a fair amount of second-guessing and finger-pointing along the corridors of Goldman Sachs, a normal reaction since many people infer that a bad

outcome is the result of a bad decision. But even though the result turned out badly, Rubin knew the decision hadn’t necessarily been wrong. He explained:

ven a large and painful loss doesn’t mean
that we had misjudged anything. As with any actuarial business, the essence of arbitrage is that if you calculate the odds correctly, you will make money on the majority of deals and on the sum total of
all your deals. If you take a six-to-one risk, you will lose money every seventh time. ... To an outsider, our business might have looked like gambling. In fact, it was the opposite of gambling, or at least of
most amateur gambling. It was an investment business built on careful analysis, disciplined judgments—often made under considerable pressure—and the law of averages.” As a veteran of deal making
at Goldman Sachs, Robert Rubin knew that roughly one deal out of seven was likely to go bad. He and his colleagues tried to improve their success rate, sure, but they knew from experience that one loss
out of seven was likely—and acceptable. (If the loss rate went much lower, it might signal that Goldman was not taking enough risks—which would also be a serious problem. The optimal rate of failure
wasn’t zero, any more than the optimal number of defaults on banks loans is zero. Just make sure that one loss doesn’t break the bank!) This view of the world is based on an appreciation of probability,
not a search for certainty.

Ifevena large and painful loss doesn’t necessarily mean a bad decision, then what does? To answer that question, we have to get beyond the Halo Effect. We have to take a close look at the decision
process itself, setting aside the eventual outcome. Had the right information been gathered, or had some important data been overlooked? Were the assumptions reasonable, or had they been flawed?
Were calculations accurate, or had there been errors? Had the full set of eventualities been identified and their impact estimated? Had Goldman Sachs's overall risk portfolio been properly considered?
This sort of rigorous analysis, with outcomes separated from inputs, isn’t natural to many people. It requires an extra mental step, judging actions on their merits rather than simply making ex post
facto attributions, be they favorable or unfavorable. It may not be an easy task, but it’s essential. Only with such a sober assessment could Goldman Sachs hope to learn from this episode and do better
next time. For Robert Rubin, this sort of thinking was natural. His view of the world was based on probabilities and uncertainty. He wrote: “Some people I've encountered in life seem more certain about
everything than I am about anything. That kind of certainty isn’t just a personality trait I lack. It’s an attitude that seems to me to misunderstand the very nature of reality—its complexity and ambigu-
ity—and thereby to provide a rather poor basis for working through decisions in a way that is likely to lead to the best results.”

Rubin's attitude, which showed a respect for complexity and ambiguity, coupling humility in good times with an insistence on learning from bad times, served him well not only at Goldman Sachs
but also in government service, where he faced decisions that were just as uncertain and for which there were no easy formulas. On his first day as secretary of the Treasury—the very day in 1995 that
he was sworn in—Rubin faced a critical decision related to the Mexican peso crisis. With Mexico facing imminent default, should the United States intervene and support Mexico or not? As he had with
arbitrage decisions, Rubin thought through the different options. What were the risks of intervention—what signals would it send, what precedents would it establish? What were the risks of not inter-
vening—would Mexico default, and if so, with what repercussions for the United States and the global monetary system? There were no formulas to follow, just careful judgment of options and proba-
bilities and consequences, each one with approximate odds, jotted down on a mental yellow pad, and forming the basis for an eventual judgment—not taken with any assurance of certain success, but
aimed at improving the chances for success to as great a degree as possible. Based on as much sound information as it could gather, the Clinton administration provided much-needed financial support
for the Mexican peso—which helped stabilize the market and begin the process of economic recovery. It was not without substantial risks and was hardly guaranteed to succeed, but it was based on the

same dispassionate thinking and assessment of probabilities that had helped Robert Rubin do so well over the course of his career.

that a strong new rival, Montreal-based Mega Bloks Inc., was chipping away at Lego’s dominant market share. But these were side issues. The main explanation for Lego's losses? Lego had strayed from
its core. It lost sight of its roots. That's what Lego’s chief executive said, and that’s what the media reported, including the Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, Bloomberg News,
Nordic Business Report, Danish News Digest, Plastics News, and about a dozen others. Depending on the source, Poul Plougmann was variously sacked, fired, axed, ousted, removed, dismissed, replaced, or
simply relieved of his duties, But aside from the verb used to describe his departure, not much differed among the articles. Lego’s big blunder was straying from the core.

Consider for a moment the word stray. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines to stray as “to wander beyond established limits,” “to deviate from a course that is regarded as
right,” and “to become lost.” A guided missile can stray off course and hit the wrong target. A dog that runs away from home is called a stray. A company can stray, too, if it goes off on a foolish adventure,
if it wanders off course, if it gets lost. Apparently that’s what Lego did—it chased merchandising spin-offs when it should have been focusing on its core product line. It strayed.

Chris Zook at Bain & Company argued in his 2001 book, Profit from the Core, that companies often do best when they focus on relatively few products for a clear segment of customers. When com-
panies get into very different products or go after very different sets of customers, the results often aren’t pretty. But here’s the catch: Exactly how do we define a company’s core? Zook identifies no
fewer than six dimensions along which a company can reasonably expand its activities—into new geographies, new channels, new customer segments, new value chain steps, new businesses, and new
products. Any one of them might be a sensible step into an adjacent area, radiating out from the core and bringing success. It’s also possible that any one of them might be fraught with danger and lead to
disaster. So how do we know which path to take? Where does the core end and where does straying off course begin? Of course, it's easy to know in retrospect—but how can we know in advance?

Which brings us back to Lego. For years, our friends at Lego did just one thing: They manufactured and sold construction building blocks for children. That was the core. Lego made millions of blocks
thanks to modern injection molding manufacturing techniques, it turned out blocks in plenty of different colors, and it made them in different shapes and sizes so they could be easily manipulated by
little hands. Children could build just about anything out of Lego blocks—the only limit was their imagination. Lego was always about construction building blocks, nothing else. It built a dominant
market share and had huge power over distributors and retailers. In this segment, Lego was king.

Unfortunately, nothing in the business world stands still—customer preferences change and technology marches on and new competitors appear. The market for traditional toys stagnated as kids
shifted to electronic games at an earlier and earlier age. By the 1990s, simple plastic building blocks were a mature product and, in a world of video games and electronic toys, well, a bit boring. If Lego
‘wanted to grow, or even if it wanted to stay the same size, it would have to try some new things—the question was what. Of all the things Lego might try, what would make the most sense? If Lego de-
cided to expand into, say, financial services, that would be straying from its core. No one would be surprised if the venture flopped—“What’s a toy company doing trying to become a bank? What do they
know about banking?”—and the responsible manager would have been removed without a second thought. What if Lego launched a line of children’s clothing? That one’s not so clear—Lego knows a lot
about kids, and it understands consumer products. It has plenty of power over retail distribution, just not in clothing, at least not yet. Maybe it could succeed, maybe not. What about electronic toys?
Again, debatable—maybe Lego could build on its experience in toys, and with all the growth in video games, why not? And in fact, Lego had developed Bionicle CD-ROM games and Mindstorm robots
made of building blocks controlled by personal computers. But Harry Potter figures? Little toys with little plastic parts that snap together? That should be smack inside Lego’s core. If Harry Potter figures
are outside Lego’s core, we ought to ask exactly how broad Lego's core really is. Because if Lego’s core is nothing but traditional blocks, we'd have to wonder how it could possibly provide sufficient growth
opportunities for a company with revenues of $2 billion.

In fact, Plougmann had been brought in from Bang & Olufsen, a Danish maker of high-quality audio equipment, in part to go after new opportunities. His hiring was seen as a coup, symptomatic of
Lego's commitment to new avenues of growth after the company posted its first loss ever in 1998. Under his guidance, Lego began to branch out into electronic toys and merchandising spin-offs, and

the initial response was good. At the time, no one said Lego was moving outside its core. But when sales fell sharply in 2003, Kristiansen lost patience and pulled the plug on Poul Plougmann. “We have

Andy Grove and the Gamble of New Technologies

Risk arbitrage at Goldman Sachs involved many transactions, none of which was large enough to break the bank—at least not if risks were managed properly. But companies also face strategic decisions
where the risks are not known and where one bad outcome cannot be offset against other favorable outcomes. There are no base rates to consult and few guidelines about the potential magnitude of
gains or losses. Some companies face these sorts of decisions only occasionally, but others—especially in industries where technology changes rapidly—have to confront them with regularity.

One manager who has navigated this uncertainty as well as anyone is Andy Grove of Intel. Born Andraz Graf in Hungary, he survived both Hitler and Stalin before immigrating to the United States in
the late 1950s, and never lost a deeply held sense that success was never assured, that failure could strike at any time. After studying chemical engineering at the University of California, Grove went to.
work in the booming electronics industry. In 1968, he moved from Fairchild along with Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce to found Intel Corporation, a new semiconductor company. This was no dowdy
industry. Semiconductor technology was advancing rapidly, with the capacity of chips doubling roughly every eighteen months, as Moore had famously observed.

In 1969, when Intel was just one year old and competing with tough, established players like Texas Instruments and Mostek, a major computer company called for proposals to build a new chip with a
64-bit memory. Intel was one of seven bidders, and after intense development efforts—working as if their life depended on it, Grove recalled—it came out on top. The 64-bit chip was a huge success for a
young company, but there was no time for complacency. Rivals were aiming to build a chip with four times the memory, with 256 bits. Again, developing the new product was seen as a matter of life and
death, and once again Intel met the challenge, coming up with the best design. And once again, rivals were busy at work, intent on developing the next generation beyond the 256-bit chip. To break clear
of the pack, Intel decided to forgo the logical next step, a 512-bit device, and set its sights on leapfrogging its competitors with a chip that held 1,024 bits, four times the previous chip. That was a choice
—a deliberate decision to do something very different but potentially beneficial. It was also very risky. It demanded Foxlike thinking: agility, a bit of cunning, sensing opportunities but also recognizing
dangers. Recalled Andy Grove: “This required taking some big technological gambles.” Once the decision was made, employees pulled together—engineers and technicians and manufacturing experts
working under intense pressure to execute the strategy. And this time, Grove recalled: “We hit the jackpot. This device became a big hit.” Note the words. Grove spoke about “gambles” and the need to “hit
the jackpot.” There was no talk about blueprints for enduring greatness or guaranteed success. Grove recognized the risks and uncertainties involved, and knew that Intel had to take bold chances that
might let the company enjoy a temporary advantage, then leverage that advantage in new fields. It was a calculated gamble, but a gamble nonetheless.

The decision to press ahead with the 1,024-bit chip was one of many risky choices that Intel made over the years. As CEO, Grove continuously scanned the environment to learn of changes in tech-
nology and competitors and customers, gathering information that could be useful for Intel. He wrote: “Think of the change in your environment as a blip on the radar screen. You can’t tell what the
blip represents at first but you keep watching radar scan after radar scan, looking to see if the object is approaching, what its speed is and what shape it takes as it moves closer. Even if it lingers on your
periphery, you still keep an eye on it because its speed and course may change.” Grove's accounts of his years at Intel are full of instances where survival called for choices made under uncertainty. They
weren't guaranteed to succeed—strategic bets never are. But as Robert Rubin said, you try to improve your chances of success by looking clearly and carefully at the odds, at your own capabilities, at the
motives and abilities of your rivals, and make the best judgment you can, with the full knowledge that even the best decisions won't always turn out well, but that failing to take measured risks ensures

that in a competitive marketplace you won't win. Yet once bets had been placed, Grove was also a believer in disciplined execution. He explained: “How can you hope to mobilize a large team of execu-


=== 91.png ===
tives to pull together, accept new and different job assignments, work in an uncertain environment and work hard despite uncertainty in the future, if the leader of the company can't or won't articulate
the shape of the [future]?” Now the Fox made way for the Hedgehog.
Building on its early successes, Intel became a powerhouse in the semiconductor industry during the 1970s and early 1980s, commanding a large share of the memory chip market. But by the

mid-1980s, Intel was under attack again, this time from Japanese firms. Intel hadn't declined in any absolute sense but was slipping relative to its surging Japanese rivals. In 1985, Noyce and Grove made

get out of memory chips entirely and shift the company into microprocessors, which were less cyclical and offered higher margins. It was hugely risky, but it paid off brilliantly.

another gutsy call:
Over the next years, Intel’s sales and profits soared, thanks in part to its partnership with Microsoft. Under Andy Grove's leadership, Intel maintained a dominant market share in microprocessors, releas-

ing generation after generation of fast and powerful chips—the 286, 386, Pentium, and beyond.

Was Intel just lucky? I don’t think so. Throughout these and other decisions, Grove knew that company performance is relative. It’s not enough to do something well;
others—and that means you have to take chances. Grove’s 1996 book, Only the Paranoid Survive, is a thoughtful primer for managers about strategic inflection points—moments of extreme risk when
the company’s life is at risk. He showed a keen understanding of industry dynamics, of changing technology, and of the necessity for making calculated bets. Grove had no delusions about following

blueprints that claim to guarantee success. A willingness to take risks is essential—and not for the faint of heart. It’s stimulated in part by a measure of fear. Grove commented:

The quality guru W. Edwards Deming advocated stamping out fear in corporations. I have trouble with the simplemindedness of this dictum. The most important role of managers is to create an envi-
ronment where people are passionately dedicated to winning in the marketplace. Fear plays a major role in creating and maintaining such passion. Fear of competition, fear of bankruptcy, fear of being

wrong and fear of losing all can be powerful motivators.

Business bestsellers don’t normally talk about fear. Fear has no place in the rosy world of rags to riches or in the cozy confines of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, where good always triumphs anda
handful of simple rules are said to lead predictably to success, regardless of what anyone else does. Fear doesn’t make a comforting bedtime story. But by now, we know that this sort of simpleminded
confidence is based on delusions and not likely to lead to the best results.

I'm not alone in my admiration for Andy Grove. In 2004, he was named the most influential CEO of the previous twenty-five years by the Wharton School. Jeffrey Garten, former dean of the Yale
School of Management, went a step further, calling Grove “a superb model for future generations of CEOs.” Why the accolades? Not just because of Intel’s superb results—other companies have done as
well if we rely on measures of stock performance—but because of Grove's ability to respond to change, to rebound from crises. Garten wrote that Grove’s genius was to align strategy and execution even
as forces of globalization were causing massive shifts in the business environment. He made calculated strategic choices, never overlooking the huge risks involved. As for execution, Grove allowed his
managers room for initiative, but “he was brutal in demanding that they measure their performance every step of the way.” He demanded that his managers think for themselves, not accept bromides
because others say they happen to be true. More recently, Grove has been the subject of a full-length biography by Richard Tedlow of Harvard Business School, who called his subject “the best model we
have for leading a business in the 21st century,” not because Grove followed a blueprint for long-term success and followed it with the tenacity of a Hedgehog, but because he was vigilant about changes

to the competitive landscape and adapted to new circumstances—technological, competitive, regulatory, and consumer. As Tedlow wrote: “Grove has escaped natural selection by doing the evolving

himself. Forcibly adapting himself to a succession of new realities, he has left a trail of discarded assumptions in his wake.”
Even as Intel prospered in the 1990s, Grove never took success for granted, never lost his Hungarian refugee’s apprehension about the risk of imminent failure. He worked closely with Clayton

Christensen of Harvard Business School in an effort to avoid the trauma of disruptive technologies. He also collaborated with Robert Burgelman of Stanford Business School, whose 2002 book, Strategy Is


=== 92.png ===
Destiny, detailed Intel's strategy-making process. If any company has shown the industry awareness, the management savvy, the track record of innovation, and the combination of deep talent as well as
deep pockets, it would be Intel. The New York Times observed: “For two decades, Intel has been the most sure-footed of Silicon Valley companies.” In 2005, it was the seventh largest American company in
market capitalization, worth more than $180 billion, and ranked eighteenth in profits.

So for all of that, was Intel assured of continuing success? Not at all. Like every successful company, Intel struggled to find new avenues for profitable growth. A competitor, AMD, made important
inroads into Intel’s dominance in microprocessors, and the market for personal computers was slowing down. Intel's early efforts to expand into new markets hadn’t been successful. Its entry into the
digital television market had sputtered. It had also been slow to recognize a shift in the chip market away from an emphasis on speed and toward the integration of microprocessors with other technolo-
gies. In 2005, the Financial Times reported: “Intel’s confidence, built on its dominance of the PC market, where its chips are inside four out of five machines sold, has been shaken over the past year.”

What was needed to improve performance? Strategic choice, of course—which always involves risk. In 2006, new CEO Paul Otellini announced that Intel would move well beyond its traditional core
of microprocessors and toward a new emphasis on chips and software, combining them into platforms aimed at a variety of fields—from the laptop to the living room to wireless applications. Along
with this shift came a redesign of Intel's brand and new company tagline—Leap Ahead. It was a bold redirection, a break from the past, and to some observers seemed almost a repudiation of the course
steered by Andy Grove. So how did Grove react? Did he denounce Intel’s new approach as an example of straying from the core? Quite the contrary. At a meeting of top Intel managers, Grove signaled
his strong approval, proclaiming Intel’s new direction as “one of the best manifestations incorporating Intel values of risk taking, discipline, and results orientation I have ever seen here.” Was success
assured? Hardly—Intel’s new strategic thrust was fraught with risk. But once again, Intel was forced to reinvent itself or accept declining growth and shrinking margins. Smart companies assess their

options and do their best to raise the probabilities of success, but even then their fortunes are still uncertain, and the wisest managers, like Andy Grove, know it.

ALook at Logitech

For a last example, we'll look at a company that doesn’t have a famous CEO or a thirty-five-year record of success. Logitech is one of the world’s leading producers of computer interface devices—mice,
keyboards, peripherals, speakers, and more. It was founded in Switzerland and is now headquartered in Fremont, California, with design and manufacturing operations in Europe, North America, and
Asia. Ina tough market with very intense competition, some of it coming from Microsoft—and now, perhaps Intel as well—Logitech has done very well. From 1999 through 2005, sales tripled and
profits grew by even more.

How can we explain Logitech’s success? It’s appealing to say that Logitech has great people, and by any objective measure it probably does, but we know that it’s easy to say favorable things about a
company’s employees as long as it’s successful. We might also guess that Logitech has a great corporate culture, and if we asked Logitech employees, they would probably say that it does, but that’s not
an adequate explanation, either. Successful companies are usually said to have great cultures—because employees like to play on a winning team and feel confident about their future. As for customer
orientation, that’s an easy one, too, because Logitech’s rapid sales growth must mean that customers like their products (like the cordless mouse I'm using right now). We might also claim that Logitech
is successful because it has followed a focused strategy, and it’s true that Logitech has focused on a fairly narrow range of products, but we can debate whether Logitech has been successful because of its
focus or whether it has remained focused because of its success. And let’s not forget leadership. We can always find reasons to infer that a rapidly growing and profitable company has a brilliant leader.

We can always find evidence of a CEO's strong vision, ability to inspire, and personal integrity. But by now we know more. Success is relative, never absolute. Competitors imitate and advantages erode.


=== 93.png ===
Even good decisions sometimes turn out badly—which doesn’t mean they were mistakes or blunders. The practices that work at one company won't have quite the same effect at another. So how should
we explain Logitech’s success?

In 2005, attended a talk by Logitech's president and CEO, Guerrino de Luca. A native of Italy, de Luca has lengthy U.S. experience, serving for many years as a senior marketing manager for Apple
Computer. I was curious: Would he try to explain Logitech's success in terms of great people and strong values and employee morale? In fact, de Luca described Logitech's success—and its challenges—
explicitly in terms of strategy and execution, and did not shy away from addressing the intrinsic uncertainty of each. First he reviewed the conscious strategic choices that Logitech had made. It focused
ona single segment: products that provide the interface between people and technology. Within that segment, it emphasized design, functionality, and technology. It cared about the user experience—
and wanted to build products that people love to use and were proud to show friends. Logitech explicitly avoided commodity products—“The minute you think your product is acommodity, it will be,”
warned de Luca. And while Logitech refused to compete on price, it deliberately maintained affordable price points so that people could make buying decisions without lengthy consultation. Recogniz-
ing the speed of technological change, Logitech also aggressively replaced its own products. De Luca pointed out that Logitech had repeatedly “killed the golden goose that brought eggs more quickly
than the market would have.” It also refrained from pursuing new products that didn’t seem to offer a chance for competitive advantage. De Luca noted: “You have to choose your playing field very
carefully, and be the best there. We've said ‘no’ many, many times to opportunities that seemed obvious, to markets that grew fast. The reason why we said no? Either because we could not differentiate,
or we felt we could not bea reasonably sized fish in those markets.” This was an ever vigilant manager, scanning the competitive environment and making choices accordingly. Logitech's emphasis on
innovation called for massive spending on research and product development, which de Luca described as “a fundamental choice that we make consciously.” Did these choices involve risk? Yes. You read
the marketplace, you study the competition, you examine trends, you look at your skills and capabilities—and you make a bet. Was Logitech, to use Andy Grove's phrase, a bit “paranoid”? Absolutely. In
this industry, given the intensity of competition and rapidity of change, it had to be.

De Luca also emphasized the importance of execution. Once strategic choices were made, the focus shifted to getting things done. “We learned many times,” he said, “modestly defined strategies have
given dramatic success through great execution.” But de Luca didn’t just invoke the word “execution,” he identified key elements that were most important for his company to succeed in its competitive
environment. One was new product development, conducted through explicit methods and processes. Another was supply chain management, which used distribution centers in North America and
Europe. Logitech also invested heavily in state-of-the-art manufacturing sites, recently opening a new facility in China. Yet for all of its attention to strategy and execution, de Luca also recognized that
success is never guaranteed. There was, he said, a concerted effort at Logitech to avoid arrogance and complacency: “We force ourselves to try to avoid the syndrome of ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ We are
constantly making changes to the way we run our business. We make changes to our organization. We make changes to our system. Resistance to change in successful companies is very high, and yet we
have to drive that change.” Did Logitech’s CEO think he was following a blueprint for enduring success? No. But he made thoughtful decisions about strategic choices—deciding what not to do as much

as what to do—followed up with disciplined execution based on clear priorities and explicit measures.

And Last

Will Logitech always thrive? Probably not. The brutal nature of market competition means that for Logitech, and for just about every other company, getting to the top is hard—it’s a mix of shrewd

strategy, superb execution, and good luck. Staying at the top is even harder, because success attracts imitators, some of which are willing to take risks that appear foolish to incumbents—but a few of


=== 94.png ===
which may turn out spectacularly well, even disrupting established players. Sooner or later, the forces of competition, coupled with technological change, will erode Logitech's position. And when its
performance falters, whether in two years or twenty, it’s inevitable that someone will say the company blundered or that the chief executive blew it. Monday morning quarterbacks will say that Logitech
should have done more of this or less of that, that it erred by straying from the core, or perhaps that it failed by staying too long in its core. Decisions that turned out badly will be castigated as bad deci-
sions. There will always be a temptation to tell a neat story that makes everything sensible and logical and that suggests why the deserving succeeded while the wicked or arrogant failed.

There will always be, as well, books that try to discover the elements that separate the best companies from the rest of the pack and that advise managers on what they might do to lead their com-
panies to loftier heights, to join the ranks of the great, the winners, the outstanding successes. Some of these books will be good, some not. Managers will continue to read them, eager to learn any new
insights, hoping to discover new things they can apply. That's not only inevitable, that’s healthy.

The central idea in this book has been that our thinking about business is shaped by a number of delusions. My hope is that managers will read business books a bit more critically, free from delusions,

their deepest fantasies and fondest hopes tempered by a bit of realism. I would hope in particular that managers would remember:

«If independent variables aren't measured independently, we may find ourselves standing hip-deep in Halos.

«If the data are full of Halos, it doesn’t matter how much we've gathered or how sophisticated our analysis appears to be.

+ Success rarely lasts as long as we'd like—for the most part, long-term success is a delusion based on selection after the fact.

+ Company performance is relative, not absolute. A company can get better and fall further behind at the same time.

«It may be true that many successful companies bet on long shots, but betting on long shots does not often lead to success.

« Anyone who claims to have found laws of business physics either understands little about business, or little about physics, or both.

- Searching for the secrets of success reveals little about the world of business but speaks volumes about the searchers—their aspirations and their desire for certainty.

Once we've swept away these delusions, what then? When it comes to managing a company for high performance, a wise manager knows:

- Any good strategy involves risk. If you think your strategy is foolproof, the fool may well be you.

- Execution, too, is uncertain—what works in one company with one workforce may have different results elsewhere.

«Chance often plays a greater role than we think, or than successful managers usually like to admit.

- The link between inputs and outcomes is tenuous. Bad outcomes don't always mean that managers made mistakes; and good outcomes don’t always mean they acted brilliantly.


=== 95.png ===
«But when the die is cast, the best managers act as if chance is irrelevant—persistence and tenacity are everything.

Will all of this guarantee success? Of course not. But I suspect it will improve your chances of success, which is a more sensible goal to pursue. And you won't find yourself on the shore of a tropical

island, wondering why, despite all your earnest efforts to follow the formula of success, the cargo planes still haven’t landed.

CHAPTER ELEVEN

Greed and the Great Recession

“a simple rule dictates my buying: Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.”

Warren E. Buffett, October 2008

When The Halo Effect was published in 2007, it wasn’t obvious that we were heading into tough times. The economy seemed to be humming on all cylinders. The Internet bubble of 2000 had receded in
memory, and a new generation of companies were leading the charge. Google went public in 2004 and was posting impressive results. Apple was riding high on the strength of its iPod; the iPhone was
new; and the iPad had not yet been released. Twitter, created in 2006, was rapidly gaining attention. The stock market set new records in the summer of 2007, and the S&P 500 went on to an all-time
high of 1,576 on October 11.

The most common example of the Halo Effect in 2007? How successful companies were explained as having strategic genius and brilliant execution and laserlike customer focus. High performance
seemed to be the natural result of great management. It made good sense.

We all remember what happened next. Even in 2007, the first tremors of the housing crisis were felt in some parts of the country, and the weakness of leading financial institutions—gorged on dubi-
ous debt and holding positions they could not cover—were starting to be noticed. From its record high in the autumn of 2007, the stock market slid for much of 2008, the S&P 500 going from 1,468.36 at
the start of January to 1,282.83 at the end of August, a decline of 12.5 percent.

With the bankruptcy of Lehmann Brothers in September 2008, the economy came to the brink of meltdown and financial markets went into free fall. The S&P 500 plunged, and on November 20
closed at 752.44, having shed more than forty percent of its value in two months. The United States sank into its deepest and most prolonged recession since the 1930s. The S&P 500 wouldn’t make up
the lost ground until April 2013.

At first, the search for blame focused on arcane financial instruments like credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), and synthetic products backed by subprime mortgages. Of

course, most people had little understanding of what those instruments did or how they could cause such damage. Plus, complex instruments were as much a symptom of the financial crisis as a cause.


=== 97.png ===
Even if swaps and debt obligations were partly to blame, that only pushed the question back one step. What had given rise to these sorts of mind-numbing instruments in the first place? A better expla-
nation was needed, and one that was simpler and more satisfying.

Soon the answer appeared. The real problem was greed.

Opinion leaders were quick to weigh in. In December 2008, as he prepared to assume the presidency, Barack Obama promised: “We will crack down on this culture of greed and scheming that has led
us to this day of reckoning.” From the Vatican, Pope Benedict XVI lamented “the triumph of greed over the common good.”

A few voices even criticized the borrowers who had taken on so much debt. Harvey Golub, former head of American Express, blamed the subprime mortgage crisis on the “greed and stupidity” of
overeager home buyers who shouldn't have bought homes they couldn’t afford. But that was a minority view, and it certainly wasn’t what the public wanted to hear.

The greatest anger was directed at the wizards of Wall Street, the bankers and financial engineers who led the economy to the edge of ruin all the while collecting massive fees and commissions.
According to William D. Cohan, the collapse was due to a “deadly combination of greed and inattention,” which led to huge positions in mortgage-backed securities. Michiko Kakutani of The New York
Times agreed that the financial crisis was due to “greed layered on greed, frosted with recklessness.”

Blaming greed made good sense. Avaricious bankers and financiers had enriched themselves while causing untold damage to average folks everywhere. What else could explain the treachery of
Bernard Madoff and his circle of feeders and investors who had been content to rack up consistently high returns when they should have known better?

Over the next few years, greed was invoked countless times. Books about the financial crisis had titles sprinkled generously with the term. There were, among others:

+ Fool's Gold: The Inside Story of J. P. Morgan and How Wall St. Greed Corrupted Its Bold Dream and Created a Financial Catastrophe, by Gillian Tet
«Crash of the Titans: Greed, Hubris, the Fall of Merrill-Lynch and the Near-Collapse of Bank of America, by Greg Farrell

«The Sellout: How Three Decades of Wall Street Greed and Government Mismanagement Destroyed the Global Financial System, by Charles Gasparino
«Reckless Endangerment: How Outsized Ambition, Greed, and Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon, by Gretchen Morgensen and Joshua Rosner

+ Age of Greed: The Triumph of Finance and the Decline of America, 1970 to the Present, by Jeff Madrick

Gordon Gekko may have had something else in mind when he said “Greed is good,” but for book titles, at least, it seems to be true. Yet it’s interesting to note that although greed appeared in the titles,
it appeared less frequently in the subsequent text. Gillian Tett mentioned greed in the title of her book, but not once in 253 pages of text. Exactly what she meant by greed, and how it corrupted a dream
and led to catastrophe, was never explained.

Even so, blaming the financial collapse on greed made for a satisfying explanation, and soon it caught on. In late 2011, when the Occupy Wall Street movement was in full swing in Manhattan's
Zuccotti Park, one claim was heard above all others. A woman dressed in a blue hospital smock held a sign that read: “This R.N. is sickened by Wall Street greed.” Another sign read: “Where Did My Future
Go? Greed Took It.”

It’s tempting to see evidence of greed once something has gone wrong, but if we're not careful, it’s just another example of the Halo Effect, this time linked to failure rather than used to explain suc-
cess. Looking back, of course, we can always find evidence of greed. In his book, CNBC's Charles Gasparino claimed that as early as the 1970s, Wall Street had been taking on excessive risk. Yet if greed had
been so clearly present at the time, why did reporters need three decades to notice it? Why would they not have exposed rampant greed had they perceived it, and saved us the grief of a recession? The

answer should be obvious: as long as profits rolled in, very few people thought anything was wrong. Bankers and financiers were hailed for their contribution to economic growth. They were praised for


=== 98.png ===
helping the economy function smoothly. They contributed to our high standard of living. They created wealth. We may have envied their success, but we applauded their ingenuity—and as individual
investors we benefitted from the rising value of our portfolios. Few wanted to call time while the music was playing.

Some observers did warn us about a looming disaster, including Nouriel Roubini of New York University. Yet as long as the economy seemed healthy, such voices were dismissed as alarmists who
didn’t understand the marvels of the marketplace. Of course, when financial markets crashed and burned—the S&P 500 hit a low of 683.38 in March 2009, a staggering loss of 46 percent in six months
and 56 percent since the high in October 2007, just a year and a half before—we changed our minds. Now we saw things differently. All along, what seemed to be prosperity had been nothing more than

greed—perhaps, in the words of Michiko Kakutani, layered and frosted.

All that Glitters Isn’t Greed

In their effort to blame greed for the financial crisis, some have rewritten history in ways reminiscent of George Orwell’s 1984. Writing in The Huffington Post, Tony Schwartz was unequivocal: “At its
most rapacious, greed trumps rationality, judgment, perspective, and any concern with the collateral damage it may cause.” To support his point, Schwartz quoted former Wall Street trader and best-
selling author Michael Lewis, who wrote in a 2002 article, “In Defense of the Boom,” “It’s more than a little nuts for a man who has a billion dollars to devote his life to making another billion, but that’s
what some of our most exalted citizens do, over and over again.” Schwartz implied that seeking ever-greater wealth is crazy, but in fact Lewis had been making the opposite point. Writing after the col-
lapse of the Internet bubble and not the housing bubble, Lewis was actually suggesting that the pursuit of gain was an essential ingredient of economic progress. His article described what he called the
virtues of vice. Markets work because they’re based on a system of incentives designed “to encourage an ignoble human trait: self-interest.” That's the very nature of private enterprise. The free market
economy “elevates the desire to make money over other, nobler desires.” Lewis acknowledged that it may seem nuts for people who are already wealthy to pursue further wealth, but was pointing out
that such a drive is precisely what oils the wheels of the entire system. Seen that way, the collateral damage of booms and busts is a relatively small price to pay for technological advances and the greater
good they bring to us all.

Of course, Lewis was writing after the Internet bubble had burst. Eight years later, the damage was far greater and the wreckage much wider. In the wake of the Great Recession, with Middle Ameri-
cans losing homes and unemployment at the highest rates in decades, the story looked a bit different. (Lewis described the collapse of the housing market in his 2010 book, The Big Short.)

No question, the pursuit of gain has always been present in private enterprise. What changed were the measures we took to keep it under control. UCLA law professor Lynn Stout pointed to the
Commodities Futures Modernization Act, passed by Congress in 2000, which dismantled a long-standing prohibition against derivative bets that didn’t hedge pre-existing risk. She explained: “By
eliminating this centuries-old rule in the name of ‘modernization,’ Congress created enormous problems of moral hazard in the off-exchange derivatives market. Imagine, for example, if we allow the
unscrupulous to buy fire insurance on other people's houses; the incidence of arson would rise dramatically.” Stout concluded: “Sadly, greed is a constant in human nature. We're not likely to eliminate
it soon. But we can at least keep it in check.” She's right. The profit motive is always present in private enterprise, and if seeking profit is a sign of greed, then greed is always present, too. The roots of the
financial crisis are due less to a sudden surge of greed, but rather to a decline in our willingness to keep the profit motive in check.

Ifmodern day authors struggle with the concept of greed, we shouldn’t be surprised. In Plato's Hipparchus, Socrates’ friend believes he understands the concept clearly: Greed is “an insatiable desire to

profit.” But as Socrates points out, reasonable people seek profit, and no reasonable person seeks a loss. If greed is a desire for profit, it follows that reasonable people can be deemed as greedy. By the end


=== 99.png ===
of the dialogue, Socrates has turned the argument on its head by demonstrating to his friend that “it is those who love the good whom you call greedy.” In ancient Greece, just as today, greed is a slippery
concept. We're quick to affix the label after the fact, once we know how things turned out, but we have trouble seeing it in the present.

Dictionaries aren't much help, either. Webster’s Dictionary defines greed as “the state of excessive or reprehensible acquisitiveness.” Are human beings acquisitive? Many of us are. So when exactly does
the urge to acquire become “excessive” or “reprehensible”? That's harder to know. What's reasonable for one person, in one economic climate, may be excessive for another. Greed is a convenient explana-

tion with satisfying moral overtones, but as a sound explanation of the financial crisis, it falls short.

Greed at Toyota...

Inferring greed retrospectively isn’t limited to the world of finance. In 2009, Toyota was the world’s largest carmaker and enjoyed an unparalleled reputation for high quality. It had successfully brought
its sophisticated production techniques to the United States, where its factories turned out millions of cars to world-class standards. Admiring books were written about the “Toyota Way,” a rigorous

approach to total quality based on advanced statistical and behavioral methods. Harvard Business Review published so many articles praising Toyota that it assembled them into a 2009 book, Harvard

Business Review on Manufacturing Excellence at Toyota, which devoted 256 pages to the world’s premier exponent of quality. The jacket glowed: “Few companies have so consistently inspired manage-
ment best practices as Toyota. In everything from strategic operational design and quality improvement to integrated product development and management training, the company has achieved suc-
cess through constant innovation. This collection shows just how Toyota does it—and how you can apply these same lessons to fuel success in your company.”

Any hint of greed here? Not the slightest.

So it came as something of a surprise when a few instances of sudden undesired acceleration (SUA) in Toyota vehicles were reported. At first there were just a handful of claims, hardly enough to
arouse concern when we considered the millions of Toyotas on the road. Then more instances of SUA were reported, including a harrowing crash in August 2009 that killed several occupants. The
problem seemed to stem from floor mats that caused the accelerator pedal to stick, a low-tech problem that call for a low-tech solution. Toyota responded with a massive recall, bringing 8 million cars in
for inspection. But if the recall was meant to demonstrate the company’s commitment to safety, it backfired. The very scale of the recall suggested that problems were widespread. (It’s a no-win for the
company. A limited recall would have led to charges that Toyota was in denial or unwilling to bear greater costs, but a large recall seemed to confirm a massive problem.) Unfortunately, fixing floor mats
couldn't explain all the instances of SUA. The problem was more complex, possibly linked to the engine or the complicated electronics and software that guide today’s automobiles. It was a baffling prob-
lem with no obvious solution.

The public wanted a satisfying answer, however, and soon it got one. Toyota was accused of greed. It was charged with putting profits ahead of safety. In testimony before the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, a retired social worker from Tennessee named Rhonda Smith described how her Lexus 350 had accelerated on Interstate 40, reaching speeds of up to ninety miles an hour. She
concluded: “Shame on you, Toyota, for being so greedy.” A website appeared, www.toyotacorporategreed info, to help spread the word. In Missouri, Bill Clark of the Columbia Daily Tribune wrote an arti-
cle titled: “Toyota's Stellar Reputation Sullied by Greed” Never mind that Mr. Clark had driven a Toyota Camry for years. Now he condemned the company for its greed, although he added that he would
buy a Toyota again once the company solved its problem. As for Rhonda Smith, her ordeal ended when, as she explained, “God intervened” and the car slowed, allowing her to tum off the ignition and

roll to a stop. As she saw it, Toyota's greed had caused the error; God’s mercy had corrected it.
