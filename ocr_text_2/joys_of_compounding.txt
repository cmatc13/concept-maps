I CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION THE BEST INVESTMENT YOU CAN MAKE IS AN INVESTMENT IN YOURSELF I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest sometimes not even the most diligent but they are learning machines They g0 to bed every night a little wiser than they were when they got up and boy does that help particularly when you have a long run ahead ofyou Charlie Munger nhis 2007 University of Southern California School of Law commencement speech Charlie Munger said that lifelong learning is para mount to longterm success Without it we wont succeed because we wont get far based on what we already know If you take Berkshire Hathaway which is certainly one of the bestregarded corporations in the world and may have the best long term investment record in the entire history of civilization the skill that got Berkshire through one decade would not have sufficed to get it through the next decade with the achievements made Without Warren Buffett being a learning machine a continuous learning machine the record would have been absolutely impossible Most people go through life not really getting any smarter But you can acquire wisdom if you truly want to obtain it In fact a sim ple formula if followed is almost certain to make you smarter over time Its simple but not easy It involves a lot of hard work patience discipline and focus Read A lot This is how Warren Buffett one of the most successful people in the business world describes his typical day Ijust sit in my office and read all day2 Sitting Reading Thinking Buffett credits many of his successful decisions to his incredible reading habit He estimates that he spends as much as 80 percent of his day reading and thinking Ina 2014 letter to Berkshire shareholders Munger outlined his expectations of the chair of the firm His first priority would be reservation of much time for quiet reading and thinking particularly that which might advance his determined learning no matter how old he became Once when asked about the key to his success Buffett held up stacks of paper and said Read 500 pages like this every day Thats how knowledge works It builds up like compound interest All of you can do it but I guarantee not many of you will do it All of us can work to improve our knowledge but most of us wont put in the effort More important than the will to win is the will to prepare Charlie Munger Selfimprovement is the ultimate form of investing in oneself It requires devoting time money attention and hard effort now for a payoff later sometimes in the far distant future A lot of people are unwilling to make this tradeoff because they crave instant gratifica tion and desire instant results These shortterm costs when applied the right way along an axis of time offer an exponential payoff when applied over a long life figure 11 If the probability andor objective is great work work work Relative performance and you may succeed in an epic way Original performance level Time Figure 11 This is compounding in action This illustrates what I experienced in 2018 after many years of determined efforts amid repeated setbacks Re silience is a superpower Source 5 Things I Learned from Elon Musk on Life Business and Investing Safal Niveshak blog September 16 2015 httpswwwsafalniveshakcomelonmuskonlifebusiness Compound interest Albert Einstein reputedly said is the most powerful force in the universe So what happens when you apply such an incredible power to knowledge building You become a learning machine One person who took Buffetts advice Todd Combs now works for the legendary investor After hearing Buffett talk Combs started keeping track of what he read and how many pages he was reading Eventually finding and reading productive material became second nature a habit As he began his investing career he would read even more hitting 600 750 even 1000 pages a day Combs discovered that Buffetts formula worked giving him more knowledge that helped him with what became his primary jobseeking the truth about potential investments Reading five hundred pages a day might not be feasible for you If however you can find ways to read or to listen to an audiobook during your day at night or on the weekends you are likely to see multiple benefits Research published in the Journal of American Academy of Neurology has shown that people who engage in mentally stimulating activities like reading experience slower memory decline than those who do not Reading is also linked with higher emotional intelligence reduced stress a wider vocabulary and improved comprehension If you think of your mind as a library three things should concern you 1 The accuracy and relevance of the information you store 2 Your ability to find or retrieve that information on demand 3 Your ability to put that information to use when you need itthat is your ability to apply it Having a repository of knowledge in your mind is pointless if you cant find and apply its contents Here Iam reminded of what Sherlock Holmes said in The Reigate Puzzle It is of the highest importance in the art of detection to be able to recognize out of a number of facts which are incidental and which vital Otherwise your energy and attention must be dissipated instead of being concentrated So be very careful of what you take in The Passionate Pursuit of Lifelong Learning The game of life is the game of everlasting learning Charlie Munger Formal education will make you a living selfeducation will make you a fortune Jim Rohn Rich people have small TVs and big libraries Poor people have small libraries and big TVs Zig Ziglar Even after achieving such enormous success Buffett continues to read for five to six hours every day He often credits this good habit for much of his success in life Reading allows him to learn the lessons of others What many people see as a threehundredpage book is often the accumulation of thousands of hours and decades of work Where else can you get the entire lifes work of someone in the space of a few hours The most talented people in any given field are selfeducated Contrary to some belief it doesnt mean grinding away without teach ers Rather its about drawing from your raw material and building out of it from a large number of sources Books Experiences People Everything in life can be a teacher when you possess the right mindset The benefits of recognizing just a few extra learning opportunities compound over time and unlock promising possibilities in the future The best way to learn something is to try to do it but the next best way to learn is from someone who has already done it This is the importance of reading and vicarious learning Understanding and learning from successful people provides insights about approaching life with the right attitude developing a sound work ethic and improving the quality of our decisions on a continuous basis In Michael Eisner and Aaron Cohens book Working Together Why Great Partnerships Succeed Buffett talked about his and Mungers fierce dedication to lifelong learning Idont think any other twosome in business was better at continuous learning than we were And if we hadnt been continuous learners the record wouldnt have been as good And we were so extreme about it that we both spent the better part of our days reading so we could learn more which is not a common pattern in business We dont read other peoples opinions We want to get the facts and then think In the following excerpt from an October 2013 interview in Fortune Buffett and Munger discuss how they were able to leap ahead of their peers and competitors Munger Weve learned how to outsmart people who are clearly smarter than we are Buffett Temperament is more important than IQ Munger The other big secret is that were good at lifelong learning Warren is better in his seventies and eighties in many ways than he was when he was younger If you keep learning all the time you have a wonderful advantage Is there a better investment than selfimprovement Here is what Buffett has had to say on the topic The best investment you can make is an investment in yourself The more you learn the more youll earn Learn from your mistakes and the mistakes of others Selfimprovement is the best way to spend some of your time every day And finding the time to read is easier than you think One way to make this happen is to carve out an hour of each day just for yourself If you need inspiration consider how Munger would sell him self the best hour of each day Inan interview for his authorized biography The Snowball Buffett shared this story about Munger Charlie as a very young lawyer was probably getting 20 an hour He thought to himself Whos my most valuable client And he decided it was himself So he decided to sell himself an hour each day He did it early in the morning working on these construction projects and real estate deals Everybody should do this be the client and then work for other people too and sell yourself an hour aday2 It is essential to understand the opportunity cost of this one hour On one hand you can indulge in getting dopaminelaced rushes from emails and social media feeds while multitasking On the other hand you can dedicate the time to deep work and selfimprovement An hours time spent acquiring indepth knowledge about an important principle pays off in the long run This current investment is mi nuscule compared with the significant net present value that results over a lifetime It is akin to buying a dollar for less than one cent This is why good books are the most undervalued asset class the right ideas can be worth millions if not billions of dollars over time Time is a resource that becomes increasingly scarce for everyone with each passing second Learn to value your time highly Buffett avoids long daily commutes to work for this very reason No matter how much money you have you cant buy more time We each have only twentyfour hours available to us every day Time is the currency of life that appreciates in value the more its spent Minimize your commute time to work and outsource all of the noncore timeconsuming menial tasks to free up valuable time for selfdevelopment The extra money spent on these small luxuries will pinch initially but over time you will realize that it was well worth it In the long term the daily investment in learning something new and improving yourself goes a long way So the best investment of time is to invest in per sonal development I hope the time you are investing in reading this book today yields positive results for the rest of your life After having successfully achieved financial freedom through my passionate pursuit of lifelong learning I can happily say that Iam a better investor because I am a lifelong learner and I ama better lifelong learner because I am an investor It seems fitting to end this chapter with the golden words of wisdom from two of the greatest learners and thinkers to have ever lived An investment in knowledge pays the best interest Benjamin Franklin Develop into a lifelong selflearner through voracious reading cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day Charlie Munger SECTION I ACHIEVING WORLDLY WISDOM CHAPTER 2 BECOMING A LEARNING MACHINE Those who keep learning will keep rising in life Charlie Munger he body is limited in ways that the mind is not In fact by the time most people are forty years old their bodies begin to deterio rate But the amount of growth and development that the mind can sustain has no limit Reading keeps our mind alive and growing Thats why we should inculcate a healthy reading habit Reading is also medita tive and calming Books are truly life changing particularly once youve developed the habit of reading every day while watching your every thought The neuronal connections that compound through the effort will make you an entirely new person after a few years Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger estimate that they spend 80 percent of their day reading or thinking about what they have read Therein lies the secret to becoming smarter The way to achieve success in life is to learn constantly And the best way to learn is to read and to do so effectively When someone asked Jim Rogers what was the best advice he ever got he said it was the advice he received from an old man in an airplane read everything All successful investors have a common habit They just love to read all the time As Munger says In my whole life I have known no wise people over a broad subject matter area who didnt read all the time none zero Youd be amazed at how much Warren readsat how much I read My children laugh at me They think Im a book with a cou ple of legs sticking out Vicarious Learning The reading of all good books is like a conversation with the finest minds of past centuries René Descartes There is no better teacher than history in determining the future There are answers worth billions of dollars in a 30 history book Bill Gross Throughout the course of humanity we have been recording knowledge in books That means theres not a lot thats new its just recycled historical knowledge Odds are that no matter what youre working on somewhere someone who is smarter than you has probably thought about your problem and put it into a book Munger says Iam a biography nut myself And I think when youre trying to teach the great concepts that work it helps to tie them into the lives and personalities of the people who developed them I think you learn economics better if you make Adam Smith your friend That sounds funny making friends among the eminent dead but if you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who had the right ideas I think it will work better in life and work better in education Its way better than just being given the basic concepts2 Making friends with the eminent dead and the great thinkers of the past is a highly rewarding exercise Morgan Housel writes Everythings been done before The scenes change but the behaviors and outcomes dont Historian Niall Fergusons plug for his profession is that The dead outnumber the living 14 to 1 and we ignore the accumulated experience of such a huge majority of mankind at our peril The biggest lesson from the 100 billion people who are no longer alive is that they tried everything were trying The details were different but they tried to outwit entrenched competition They swung from optimism to pessimism at the worst times They battled unsuccessfully against reversion to the mean They learned that popular things seem safe because so many people are involved but theyre most dangerous because theyre most competitive Same stuff that guides today and will guide tomorrow History is abused when specific events are used as a guide to the future Its way more useful as a benchmark for how people react to risk and incentives which is pretty stable over time The more you read the more you build your mental repertoire Incrementally the knowledge you add to your stockpile will grow over time as it combines with everything new you put in there This is compounding in action and it works with knowledge in much the same way as it does with interest Eventually when faced with new challenging or ambiguous situations you will be able to draw on this dynamic inner repository or what Munger refers to as a latticework of mental models Mental models are an explanation of how things work what variables matter in a given situation and how they interact with one another Mental models are how we make sense of the world You will then respond as someone whose instincts and judgment have been honed by the experiences of others rather than just your own You will start to see that nothing is truly new that incredible challenges can and have been overcome and that there are funda mental truths about how the world works So learn from others Figure out where you are going and find out who has been there before Knowledge comes from experience but it doesnt have to be your experience Creating Time to Read Learn and Think Warren and I do more reading and thinking and less doing than most people in business We do that because we like that kind of a life But weve turned that quirk into a positive outcome for ourselves We both insist on a lot of time being available almost every day tojust sit and think That is very uncommon in American business We read and think Charlie Munger The rich invest in time the poor invest in money Warren Buffett The rich have money The wealthy have control over their time And time is the scarcest resource because of its nonrenewability Time is a universally depleting resource reduced at the same rate for the wealthy as for the poor This gives us one way of defining a successful investor as a person for whom time has become a more binding constraint than money The ultimate status symbol is time Time is the new money My friends and colleagues often ask me how I manage to find so much time for reading while having a fulltime job and managing my household chores For starters I hardly watch television I dont even have a cable television connection I get all my desired content on Netflix YouTube and Amazon Prime I watch only those select few movies documentaries and shows that truly pique my interest I ensure that I dont spend a lot of time commuting to my workplace I live in an area where I can walk to the grocery store finish my purchases and return home in less than twenty minutes I have fully automated the monthly payments online for my phone electricity Internet utili ties and meal plan bills Allthese choices are deliberate If you assume that the average person spends two hours a day watching television an hour for commuting and another two hours a week shopping that adds up to twentythree hours a week Twentythree hours That is 1380 minutes That is a lot of time If you read a page in two minutes thats almost seven hundred pages a week Do seven hundred pages a week sound like too much for you Well how about just twentyfive pages a day Shane Parrish writes While most of us dont have the time to read a whole book in one sitting we do have the time to read 25 pages a day Reading the right books even if its a few pages a day is one of the best ways to ensure that you go to bed alittle smarter than you woke up Twentyfive pages a day doesnt sound like much but this commitment adds up over time Lets say that two days out of each month you probably wont have time to read Plus Christmas That gives you 340 days a year of solid reading time If you read 25 pages a day for 340 days thats 8500 pages 8500 What I have also found is that when I commit to a minimum of 25 pages I al most always read more So lets call the 8500 pages 10000 I only need to extend the daily 25 pages into 30 to get there With 10000 pages a year at a general pace of 25day what can we get done Well The Power Broker is 1100 pages The four LBJ books written by Robert Caro are collectively 3552 pages Tolstoys two masterpiecesWar and Peace and Anna Kareninacome in at a combined 2160 Gibbons The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is six volumes and runs to about 3660 pages Thats 10472 pages That means in about one year at a modest pace of 25 pages a day youd have knocked out 13 masterful works and learned an enormous amount about the history of the world In one year That leaves the following year to read Shirers Rise and Fall of the Third Reich 1280 Carl Sandburgs Six Volumes on Lincoln 2000 Adam Smiths Wealth of Nations unabridged 1200 and Boswells johnson 1300 with plenty of pages left to read some thing else This is how the great works get read day by day 25 pages at a time No excuses The point of assigning yourself a certain amount of reading every day is to create a deeply held habit The 25pagesaday thing is a habitformer Read what seems awesome and interesting to you now and let your curiosities grow organically A lifelong interest in truth reality and knowledge will lead you down so many paths you should never need to force yourself to read anything unless there is a very very specific reason Perhaps to learn specific skill for a job Not only is this approach way more fun but it works really really well It keeps you reading It keeps you interested And in the words of Nassim Taleb Curiosity is antifragile like an addiction magnified by attempts to satisfy it Thus paradoxically as you read more books your pile of unread books will get larger not smaller Thats because your curios ity will grow with every great read This is the path of the lifelong learner This is compounding wisdom in action This is how you become smarter You must value your time very highly Youve got to keep control of your time and you cant unless you say no You cant let people set your agenda in life Warren Buffett A Passion for Reading and Learning The purpose of reading is not just raw knowledge Its that it is part of the human experience It helps you find meaning understand your self and make your life better Ryan Holiday Iread to increase knowledge I read to find meaning I read for a better understanding of others and myself I read to discover I read to make my life better I read to make fewer mistakes To paraphrase David Ogilvy reading and learning is a priceless opportunity to furnish our mind and enrich the quality of our life Wherever I go a book is not far behind It might be on my phone or a physical copy but a book is always close by I love printed books I just find something so calming and peaceful about reading a paperback or hardcover book During my initial years in America when I had to commute long distances to reach my workplace I used to read books on my seat in the bus to ensure that not a single minute was wasted during my learning and development phase Finding time to read is easier than you might think Waiting for a bus Stop staring down the street and read Waiting for a taxi Read On the train Read On the plane Read Waiting at the airport for your flight Read Reading alone however isnt enough to improve your knowledge Learning something insightful requires work You have to read something above your current level You need to find writers who are more knowledgeable on a particular subject than you are This is how you become more intelligent Reach out to and associate with people better than you and you cannot help but improve Alot of people confuse knowing the name of something with understanding it This is a good heuristic Anything effortlessly digested means that you are reading for information For example the job of the news media is to inform us about daytoday events to entertain us to reflect the public moods and sentiments of the moment and to print sto ries that will interest us today and that we will want to read But thats exactly what creates problems for readers who often succumb to the recency and availability biases that news creates The same applies to social media The feeds we take in are characterized by recency bias Most of what we consume is less than twenty four hours old Rarely do we stop to ask ourselves questions about what we consume Is this important Is this going to stand the test of time for even a year As you grow older and become more mature you realize that not everything deserves a response This truth applies to most things in life and almost everything in the news Were surrounded by so much information that is of immediate interest to us that we feel overwhelmed by the neverending pres sure of trying to keep up with it all Nicholas Carr The true scarce commodity of the near future will be human attention Satya Nadella Inan informationrich world the wealth of information means a dearth of something else a scarcity of whatever it is that infor mation consumes What information consumes is rather obvious it consumes the attention of its recipients Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of informa tion sources that might consume it Herbert Simon In my view studying old newspapers is a far more productive exercise than reading todays newspaper Buffett likes to call it in structive art Morgan Housel writes Every piece of financial news you read should be filtered by asking the question Will I still care about this in a year Five years Ten years The goal of information should be to help you make better decisions between now and the end of your ultimate goals Read old news and youll quickly see that the life expectancy of your goals is higher than that of the vast majority of headlines Nassim Nicholas Taleb writes in his book Fooled by Randomness Minimal exposure to the media should be a guiding principle for someone involved in decision making under uncertaintyincluding all participants in financial markets His key argument is that what is reported in the media is noise rather than information but most people do not realize that the media is paid to get our attention The key lesson is that in the pursuit of wisdom we must read much more of what has endured over time such as history or biogra phies than what is ephemeral such as daily news social media trends and the like I agree with Andrew Ross who says The smallest bookstore still contains more ideas of worth than have been presented in the entire history of television Allof the history of humankind is a short chapter in the history of biology And all of biology is a short chapter in the history of the planet And the planet is a short chapter in the history of the universe Willand Ariel Durant Will and Ariel Durants work compresses five thousand years of history into one hundred pages of conclusions It focuses on time less truths not on todays trendsthe antithesis of social media The book highlights the lessons of history not the events that define it It explains how all of life from the simplicity of singlecelled organisms to the complexity of humans is governed by the laws and trials of evolution The laws of biology double as the fundamental lessons of history All beings are subject to the processes and trials of evolution Only the fittest survive Natural selection leads to better qualities being retained and passed along The result is a constant cycle of im provement for the whole Always respect the old Apply the Lindy effect to reading and learning According to Nassim Taleb The Lindy effect is a concept that the future life expectancy of some nonperishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy2 So a book that has stood the test of time and survived fifty or one hundred or five hundred years and is still widely read because it contains timeless wisdom is expected to survive another fifty or one hundred or five hundred years for that very reasonthat is its wisdom is timeless The man who doesnt read good books has no advantage over the man who cannot read them Mark Twain One should read on varied topics such as health and fitness personal finance investing business economics decision making human behavior history philosophy selfawareness and of course life Reread the classics in these fields on a regular basis Use the Lindy effect to your advantage Also share your latest book purchases with likeminded friends Its a lot of fun to coread and exchange insights Reading for understanding narrows the gap between reader and writer How can we read better to bridge this gap How to Read a Book The goal of reading determines how you should read Although many people are proficient in reading for information and entertainment few improve their ability to read for knowledge Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren have written the seminal book on reading Their How to Read a Book provides the necessary skills to read anything Adler and Van Doren identify four levels of reading elementary inspectional analytical and syntopical Before we can improve reading skills we need to understand the differences among these reading levels They are discussed as levels because you must master one level before you can move to a higher level They are cumulative and each level builds on the preceding one Here is how Adler and Van Doren describe these four levels 1 Elementary reading This is the most basic level of reading as taught in our elementary schools It is when we move from illiter acy to literacy 2 Inspectional reading This is another name for scanning or superficial reading It means giving a piece of writing a quick yet meaningful advance review to evaluate the merits of a deeper reading experience Whereas the question that is asked at the first level ele mentary reading is What does the sentence say the question typically asked at this level is What is the book about 3 Analytical reading Analytical reading is a thorough reading This is the stage at which you make the book your own by convers ing with the author and asking many organized questions Asking a book questions as you read makes you a better reader But you must do more You must attempt to answer the questions you are asking While you could do this in your mind Adler and Van Doren argue that its much easier to do this with a pencil in your hand The pencil they argue becomes the sign of your alertness while you read Adler and Van Doren share the many ways to mark a book They recommend that we underline or circle the main points draw verti cal lines at the margin to emphasize a passage already underlined or too long to be underlined place a star asterisk or other symbol at the margin for emphasis place numbers in the margin to indicate a sequence of points made in developing an argument place page numbers of other pages in the margin to remind ourselves where else in the book the author makes the same points circle keywords or phrases and write our questions and perhaps answers in the margin or at the top or bottom of the pages This is how we remember the best ideas out of the books we read long after we have read themby making a book our own through asking questions and seeking answers within it As Cicero said Nothing so much assists learning as writing down what we wish to remember 4 Syntopical reading Thus far we have been learning about how to read a book The highest level of reading syntopical reading allows you to synthesize knowledge from a comparative reading of several books about the same subject This is where the real virtue of reading is actualized Syntopical reading also known as comparative reading involves reading many books on the same subject and then comparing and contrasting the ideas insights and arguments within them In syntopical reading you create a latticework of the information in those books along with your own life experiences and personal knowledge to create mental models and new insights and form an understand ing of the world that never quite existed before This is the step that prepares the way for an original thinker to make a breakthrough Its a lot of fun to do thisto find connections between seemingly unconnected ideas from different disciplines I cannot overem phasize the importance of this activity because it has often led to many instances of serendipity and good fortune in my investing journey Lusually read multiple nonfiction books in tandem I pick the one that interests me the most at the time and read at least one full chapter If it keeps my interest I keep going for another chapter But if not Ill jump to another book and read a full chapter It is harder to do this with fiction because you tend to lose the train of the plot and narrative I read this way because I start to see patterns across books about different topics You may be reading one book on economics one on business strategy and another one on physics Then suddenly something pops up that represents a common thread among those themes The past is not fixed Yes it is true The past is not fixed Reading can change this because a new book can make you aware of some thing incredible in an old book that you previously had not recognized This is how knowledge compounds Something you perceived to be of low value in an old book transforms into something of significant value unlocked by another book in the future Therefore no books are necessarily the best Usually some combination of books in unison produce a big nonlinear impact Although many books may seem unrelated to one another in reality they are all connected through some common threads This realiza tion creates a significant advantage because it lets your interests pull you along rather than forcing you to set a selfimposed deadline to finish a book And if a book doesnt interest you you just abandon it to save time and move on to something more interesting Reading multiple books simultaneously quitting those that are not engaging and constantly picking up new ones is the antifragile approach to selfeducation Ina 2017 interview AngelList cofounder and CEO Naval Ravikant said I dont know about you but I have very poor attention I skim I speed read jump around I could not tell you specific passages or quotes from books At some deep level you do absorb them and they become part of the threads of the tapestry of your psyche emphasis added 2 It is this development of the tapestry of the psyche that re ally matters a lot in becoming a wiser person over time How can we develop the same By starting early and taking advantage of the Matthew effect The Matthew Effect in Knowledge Acquisition Imagine that you and Buffett are reading the latest issue of The Economist magazine Who do you think will end up with greater insight at the end of this reading session The answer is obvious isnt it And for good reason Buffett is eightynine years old and even at this age he continues to be a relentless learning machine He not only started learning early but also has been accumulating knowledge for more than threequarters of a century The Matthew effect in this context refers to a person who has more expertise and thus has a larger knowledge base This larger knowledge base allows that person to acquire greater expertise at a faster rate So the amount of useful insight that Buffett can draw from the same reading material would be quite high compared with most any other person and again Buffett would end up becoming smarter at a faster rate As you read increasingly more your capacity to read and absorb more knowledge increases rapidly During the initial days of inculcating my reading habit I found it difficult to grasp the deep significance of many of the concepts in the books I read Gradually over time I started discovering connections between the ideas that spread across different books It is these connections that lead to the devel opment of the tapestry of the psyche which in turn deepens our understanding of the big ideas coming from the key disciplines This deep understanding makes the brain more efficient and smarter and better able to make sense of new information None of us can know everything but we can work to understand the big important models at a basic level across a broad range of disciplines so they can collec tively add value in the decisionmaking process Deep reading of the fundamentals enables us to understand the world for what it is This is how we leam to reason from first principles First Principles Thinking As to methods there may be a million and then some but principles are few The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods The man who tries methods ignoring principles is sure to have trouble Harrington Emerson When you first start to study a field it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things You dont What you need is to identify the core principlesgenerally three to twelve of themthat govern the field The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply vari ous combinations of the core principles John Reed The best way to achieve wisdom is to learn the big ideas that underlie reality Even people who arent geniuses can outthink the rest of mankind if they develop certain thinking habits Charlie Munger Five words separate the good from the great flawless execution of the fundamentals Boiling things down to their most fundamental truths thats to first principles deconstructing and then reasoning up from there reconstructing enables us to look at the world from the perspective of physics This type of reasoning removes complexity from the decisionmaking process so that we can focus on the most important aspects that pertain to the decision at hand Reasoning from first principles removes the impurity of assumptions and conven tions Instead what remains is the essential information First principles are the origins or the main concepts that cannot be reduced to anything else Over two thousand years ago Aristotle defined a first principle as the first basis from which a thing is known These are the fundamental assumptions that we know are true When you have something that you know is true even over the long term you can afford to put a lot of energy into it Jeff Bezos First principles thinking is a way of saying Think like a scientist Scientists dont assume anything They start with questions like What are we absolutely sure is true or What has been proven When Jeff Bezos started Amazoncom in 1995 he clearly identified the first principles that would guide his business philosophythat is longterm thinking and a relentless focus on the customer rather than on the competition This led Amazon to focus on things that dont change such as customers preference for low prices fast delivery and wider product selection rather than on things that can and do change Bezos has continued to focus relentlessly on these first principles until this date and this line of thinking has made him one of the richest people in the world According to James Clear In theory first principles thinking requires you to dig deeper and deeper until you are left with only the foundational truths of a situation Rene Descartes the French philosopher and scientist embraced this approach with a method now called Cartesian Doubt in which he would systematically doubt everything he could possibly doubt until he was left with what he saw as purely indubita ble truths In practice you dont have to simplify every problem down to the atomic level to get the benefits of first principles thinking You just need to go one or two levels deeper than most people Different solutions present themselves at different layers of abstrac tion By focusing on the fundamental questions and then while answering these questions going two or three levels deeper by asking at every step and then what we can arrive at the truth This is the art of reductionism Less is more When we remove the things that arent truly representative of reality we get closer to the ultimate truth Michelangelo was once asked by the pope about the secret of his genius particularly with regards to the statue of David one of the greatest sculpting masterpieces of all time Michelangelo responded by saying David was always there in the marble Ijust took away everything that was not David Nassim Taleb calls this subtractive epistemology He argues that the greatest contribution to knowledge consists of removing what we think is wrong We know a lot more about what is wrong than what is right What does not work ie negative knowledge is more robust than positive knowledge This is because it is a lot easier for something we know to fail than it is for something we know isnt so to succeed Taleb dubs this philosophy via negativa employing a Latin phrase used in Christian theology to explain a way of de scribing God by focusing on what he is not rather than on what he is The absence of evidence doesnt qualify as the evidence of absence In other words just because all of the swans that have been observed to date are white doesnt prove that all swans are white One small observation ie spotting a black swan can conclusively disprove the statement all swans are white but millions of observations can hardly confirm it Thus disconfirmation is more rigorous than confirmation Elon Musk once referred to knowledge as a semantic tree Make sure you understand the fundamental principles i the trunk and big branches before you get into the leavesdetails or there is nothing for them to hang onto2 When you want to learn a new subject first identify the fundamental principles and learn those in a clear and deep manner Is there a way for us to do this effectively It turns out that indeed a simple way to do this exists Its simple but not easy The Feynman Technique The Feynman technique named after Nobel Prizewinning physicist Richard Feynman is a great method for learning anything in a clear and deep manner and for improving retention The Feynman technique has four simple steps 1 Pick and study a topic 2 Take out a blank sheet of paper and write at the top the subject you want to learn Write out what you know about the subject as if you were teaching it to someone who is unfamiliar with the topicand not your smart adult friend but rather a tenyearold child who can under stand only basic concepts and relationships 3 When you must use simple language that a child can understand you force yourself to understand the concept at a deeper level and to sim plify relationships and connections among ideas If you struggle you have a clear understanding of where you have gaps in knowledge This is valuable feedback because you have now discovered the edge of your mental capabilities Knowing the limits of your knowledge is the dawning of wisdom 4 Return to the source material and then reread and relearn it Repeat step 2 and compile information that will help you fill in those gaps in your understanding that you identified in step 3 Review and simplify further as necessary One sentence written by Feynman encapsulates the power of this technique What started as a question about our existence has been translated into a single sentence that can be understood even by a middleschool student All things are made of atomslittle parti cles that move around in perpetual motion attracting each other when they are a little distance apart but repelling upon being squeezed into one another Basically Feynman says that if you know nothing about physics the most essential scientific knowledge to understand is that everything is made up of atoms In one simple sentence Feynman conveys the foundational existence of our universe Little wonder that he is widely regarded as one of the greatest teachers to have ever lived Ina similar vein consider Newtons law of gravity the force of attraction between two bodies depends on their distance Newton needed just a few pen strokes to express that thought mathematically But from it he showed why the planets move as they do where comets fly and even how high the tides flow Later generations elaborated on this information until we were able to send rockets satel lites and humans into space From Newtons earliest thought the vast field of science and engineering grew to its present state To apply first principles thinking to the field of value investing consider several fundamental truths Understand and practice the following if you want to become a good investor 1 Look at stocks as part ownership of a business 2 Look at Mr Marketvolatile stock price fluctuationsas your friend rather than your enemy View risk as the possibility of permanent loss of purchasing power and uncertainty as the unpredictability regarding the degree of variability in the possible range of outcomes 3 Remember the three most important words in investing margin of safety 4 Evaluate any news item or event only in terms of its impact on a future interest rates and b the intrinsic value of the business which is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out during its remaining life adjusted for the uncertainty around receiving those cash flows 5 Think in terms of opportunity costs when evaluating new ideas and keep a very high hurdle rate for incoming investments Be unreason able When you look at a business and get a strong desire from within saying I wish I owned this business that is the kind of business in which you should be investing A great investment idea doesnt need hours to analyze More often than not it is love at first sight 6 Think probabilistically rather than deterministically because the future is never certain and it is really a set of branching probability streams At the same time avoid the risk of ruin when making decisions by focusing on consequences rather than just on raw probabil ities in isolation Some risks are just not worth taking whatever the potential upside may be 7 Never underestimate the power of incentives in any given situation 8 When making decisions involve both the left side of your brain logic analysis and math and the right side intuition creativity and emotions 9 Engage in visual thinking which helps us to better understand complex information organize our thoughts and improve our ability to think and communicate 10 Invert always invert You can avoid a lot of pain by visualizing your life after you have lost a lot of money trading or speculating using deriv atives or leverage If the visuals unnerve you dont do anything that could get you remotely close to reaching such a situation 11 Vicariously learn from others throughout life Embrace everlasting humility to succeed in this endeavor 12 Embrace the power of longterm compounding All the great things in life come from compound interest In addition to these fundamental truths the value investing discipline has certain finer aspects that we come to realize and appreci ate only with the passage of time and with experience Knowledge is overrated Wisdom is underrated Intellect is overrated Temperament is underrated Outcome is overrated Process is underrated Shortterm outperformance is overrated Longterm adherence to ones investment philosophy is underrated Gross return is overrated Stressadjusted return is underrated Upside potential is overrated Downside protection is underrated Maximization of returns is overrated Avoidance of ruin is underrated Growth is overrated Longevity is underrated Entry multiple is overrated Exit multiple is underrated Pricetoearnings ratio is overrated Duration of competitive advantage period is underrated Categorization of stocks into large cap mid cap and small cap is overrated Categorization of businesses into great good and grue some is underrated Being more frequently right than others is overrated Being less wrong than others is underrated Forecasting is overrated Preparation is underrated Confidence is overrated Humility is underrated Conviction is overrated Pragmatism is underrated Complexity is overrated Simplicity is underrated Analytical ability is overrated Personal behavior is underrated Having a high income level is overrated Inculcating a disciplined saving habit is underrated Competition with peers is overrated Helping our peers is underrated Large personal net worth is overrated Good karma is underrated Talent is overrated Resilience is underrated Being the best investor is overrated Being the most authentic version of yourself is underrated CHAPTER 3 OBTAINING WORLDLY WISDOM THROUGH A LATTICEWORK OF MENTAL MODELS Study the science of art Study the art of science Develop your sensesespecially learn how to see Realize that everything connects to everything else Leonardo da Vinci cialization is only amplified You become a specialist in certain aspects of the organization you work for This approach however doesnt help solve problems Because you dont know about the big ideas from the key disciplines you start making decisions that dont take into account how the world really works As in the story of the blind men and the elephant you cannot see the whole picture And investing is a liberal art that involves crosspollination of ideas from multiple disciplines A ny field you enter from finance to engineering requires some degree of specialization Once you land a job the process of spe Marcel Proust said The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeing new sights but in looking with new eyes Multidisciplinary thinking is what allows us to see with new eyes Charlie Munger uses a latticework of mental models to make more rational and effective decisions Shane Parrishs summary compilation of the various mental models on the Farnam Street blog is an excellent resource to build up ones latticework1 As the Chinese proverb goes I forget what I hear I remember what I see I know what I do Because the best way to learn something is by practicing it we must routinely apply the mental models to different situations in our daily lives One of Mungers favorite authors is Herbert Simon who gave him the idea of mental models Simon wrote in his autobiography Models of My Life The decision maker of experience has at his disposal a checklist of things to watch out for before finally accepting a decision Ifone could open the lid so to speak and see what was in the head of the experienced decision maker one would find that he had at his disposal repertoires of possible actions that he had checklists of things to think about before he acted and that he had mecha nisms in his mind to evoke these and bring these to his conscious attention when the situations for decisions arose emphasis added2 In his book Charlie Munger The Complete Investor Tren Griffin lays out Mungers path to worldly wisdom Munger has adopted an approach to business and life that he refers to as worldly wisdom Munger believes that by using a range of different models from many different disciplinespsychology history mathematics physics philosophy biology and so on a person can use the combined output of the synthesis to produce something that has more value than the sum of its parts Robert Hagstrom wrote a wonderful book on worldly wisdom entitled vesting The Last Liberal Art in which he states that each disci pline entwines with and in the process strengthens every other From each discipline the thoughtful person draws significant mental models the key ideas that combine to produce a cohesive understanding Those who cultivate this broad view are well on their way to achieving worldly wisdom Munger chose the latticework model to convey this idea of interconnectedness We need more than a deep understanding of just one disci plinewe need a working knowledge of many disciplines and an understanding of how they interact with each other Worldly Wisdom In Mungers view it is better to be worldly wise than to spend lots of time working with a single model that is precisely wrong A multiple model approach that is only approximately right will produce a far better outcome in anything that involves people or a social system Tren Griffin Munger would be what the Greek poet Archilochus called a fox Some 2700 years ago Archilochus wrote The fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing In the 1950s philosopher Isaiah Berlin used that sentence as the basis for his essay The Hedgehog and the Fox In it Berlin divides great thinkers into two categories hedgehogs who have one big overarching perspective on the world and foxes who have many different viewpoints That essay over time has become a foundational part of thinking about the distinction between specialists and generalists Generalizing specialists have a core competency that they know a lot about At the same time they are always learning and have a working knowledge of other areas Although a generalist has roughly the same knowledge for multiple areas a generalizing specialist has one deep area of expertise and a few shallow ones We have the option of developing a core competency while also building a base of inter disciplinary knowledge When Munger was asked at the 2017 Daily Journal Corporation meeting whether one should become a polymath or a specialist his answer surprised a lot of people Many people in the audience expected the answer to be obviousof course he would recommend that people become generalists But this is not what Munger said I dont think operating over many disciplines as I do is a good idea for most people I think its fun thats why Ive done it And m better at it than most people would be and I dont think Im good at being the very best at handling differential equations So its been a wonderful path for me but I think the correct path for everybody else is to specialize and get very good at something that society rewards and then to get very efficient at doing it But even if you do that I think you should spend 10 to 20 percent of your time on trying to know all the big ideas in all the other disciplines emphasis added In Mungers comments we find the underlying approach most likely to yield exponential results specialize most of the time but spend some time understanding the broader ideas of the world That is how one attains worldly wisdom This approach isnt what most organizations and educational institutions advocate Branching out into other disciplines outside ones core is not what generally is taught in academia It is a project we have to undertake ourselves by reading a wide range of books ex perimenting with different subject areas and drawing ideas from them A true education should cultivate above all a sense of enjoyment about the process of thinking things through Munger talked about the importance of cultivating a broadbased general awareness during his 1995 speech at Harvard University Mans imperfect limitedcapacity brain easily drifts into working with whats easily available to it and the brain cant use what it cant remember or what it is blocked from recognizing because its heavily influenced by one or more psychological tendencies bearing strongly on its Where do we get to learn these models from We let history be our guide If one way to ensure that we make poor decisions is to use a small sample size we can reason that we should seek the biggest sample sizes we can What crosses most of history Peter Kaufman CEO of Glenair board member of the Daily Journal Corporation and editor of Poor Charlies Almanack has shared the answer in his threebucket framework Every statistician knows that a large relevant sample size is their best friend What are the three largest most relevant sample sizes for identifying universal principles Bucket number one is inorganic systems which are 137 billion years in size Its all the laws of math and physics the entire physical universe Bucket number two is organic systems 35 billion years of biology on Earth And bucket number three is human history you can pick your own number I picked 20000 years of recorded human behavior Those are the three largest sample sizes we can access and the most relevant If we are to improve our learning we should focus on things that change slowly Kaufmans approach provides a framework of general laws that have stood the test of timeinvariant unchanging lenses that we can use to focus and arrive at workable answers A foundational principle that aligns with the world and is applicable across the geologic time scale of human organic and inorganic history is compounding Compounding is one of the most powerful forces in the world In fact it is the only power law in the universe that exists with a variable in its exponent The power law of compounding not only is applicable to investing but also and more important can be applied to continued learning The fastest way to simplify things is to spot the symmetries or invariancesthat is the fundamental prop erties that do not change from one object under study to another Munger explains The models that come from hard science and engineering are the most reliable models on this Earth And engineering quality controlat least the guts of it that matters to you and me and people who are not professional engineersis very much based on the elementary mathematics of Fermat and Pascal And of course the engineering idea of a backup system is a very powerful idea The engineering idea of breakpointsthats a very powerful model too The notion of a critical massthat comes out of physicsis a very powerful model2 But learning the big ideas from the key disciplines is not enough We need to understand how these ideas interact and combine with each other because this is what leads to lollapalooza effects Munger explains You get lollapalooza effects when two three or four forces are all operating in the same direction And frequently you dont get simple addition Its often like critical mass in physics where you get a nuclear explosion if you get to a certain point of massand you dont get anything much worth seeing if you dont reach the mass Sometimes the forces just add like ordinary quantities and sometimes they combine on a break point or critical mass basis More commonly the forces coming out ofmodels are conflicting to some extent And you get huge miserable tradeoffs You have to realize the truth of biologist Julian Huxleys idea that Life is just one damn relatedness after another So you must have the models and you must see the relatedness and the effects from the relatedness Commenting on Munger Bill Gates once said He is truly the broadest thinker I have ever encountered Warren Buffett has said that Munger has the best thirtysecond mind in the world He goes from A to Z in one move He sees the essence of everything before you even finish the sentence2 How is Munger able to do this Thinking One of the advantages of a fellow like Buffettis that he automatically thinks in terms of decision trees emphasis added Charlie Munger The more models you have from outside your discipline and the more you iterate through them in a checklist sort of fashion when faced with a challenge the better youll be able to solve problems Models are additive Like building blocks The more you have the more things you can build the more connections you can make between them and the more likely you are to be able to determine the relevant variables that govern a situation And when you learn these models you need to ask yourself under what conditions this tool will fail That way youre not only looking for situations in which the tool is useful but also for situations in which something interesting is happening that might warrant further attention We can improve our thinking process by taking out and devoting the necessary time for it According to Tren Griffin Mungers breadth of knowledge is something that is naturally part of his character but also something that he intentionally cultivates In his view to know nothing about an important subject is to invite problems Both Munger and Buffett set aside plenty of time each day to just think Anyone reading the news is provided with constant reminders of the consequences of not thinking Thinking is a surprisingly underrated activity Researchers published a study in 2014 that revealed that approximately a quarter of women and twothirds of men chose electric shocks over spending time alone with their own thoughts2 Bertrand Russell rightly said Most people would rather die than think and many of them do Without great solitude no serious work is possible Pablo Picasso One of the finest essays on learning how to think better is Solitude and Leadership by William Deresiewicz Thinking means concentrating on one thing long enough to develop an idea about it Not learning other peoples ideas or memoriz ing a body of information however much those may sometimes be useful Developing your own ideas In short thinking for your self You simply cannot do that in bursts of 20 seconds at a time constantly interrupted by Facebook messages or Twitter tweets or fiddling with your iPod or watching something on YouTube Ifind for myself that my first thought is never my best thought My first thought is always someone elses its always what Ive already heard about the subject always the conventional wisdom Its only by concentrating sticking to the question being patient letting all the parts of my mind come into play that I arrive at an original idea By giving my brain a chance to make associations draw connections take me by surprise You do your best thinking by slowing down and concentrating2 Look at this generation with all of its electronic devices and multitasking I will confidently predict less success than Warren who just focused on reading If you want wisdom youll get it sitting on your ass Thats the way it comes Charlie Munger Munger has often credited his success to having a long attention span that is his ability to stay focused for an extended period of time Munger is able to block out the world when he is thinking which has provided him a great advantage in solving problems and devel oping ideas Long attention spans allow for a deep understanding of subjects When combined with deliberate practice it helps us identify our leverage points and focus our energies on them As you can see actual thinking is really hard work It is why Henry Ford said Thinking is the hardest work there is which is prob ably why so few people engage in it The best ideas come to you in solitude Introverts tend to be creative because by spending more time alone they are more susceptible to inspiration Introverts are less susceptible to groupthink and thus it is easier for them to go against the consensus Brilliant people arent a special breedthey just use their minds differently They practice certain habits of thinking that allow them to see the world differently from others In their book The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking Dr Edward B Burger and Dr Michael Star bird outline some practical ways for us to improve our thinking 1 Understand deeply When you learn anything go for depth and make it rock solid Any concept that you are trying to master is a combina tion of simple core ideas Identify the core ideas and learn them deeply This deeply ingrained knowledge base can serve as a meaningful springboard for more advanced learning and action in your field Be brutally honest with yourself If you do not understand something revisit the core concepts again and again Remember that merely memorizing stuff is not deep learning 2 Make mistakes Mistakes highlight unforeseen opportunities as well as gaps in our understanding And mistakes are great teachers As Michael Jordan once said Ive missed more than nine thousand shots in my career Ive lost almost three hundred games Twentysix times Ive been trusted to take the gamewinning shot and missed Ive failed over and over and over again in my life And that is why I succeed The takeaway is that we cannot come out with a correct solution on the first attempt Start with a probable solution hypoth esis and continue correcting the mistakes until you arrive at the right solution Thomas Edison was famous for using this approach for his inventions When he said that invention is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration the perspiration was the process of in crementally making mistakes and learning from them to make the next attempts apt to be closer to right When Edison was asked how he felt about his countless failed attempts at making a light bulb he replied I have not failed Ive just found ten thousand ways that wont work 3 Raise questions If you want to deepen your understanding you need to raise questions Do not be afraid to show your ignorance If you do not understand ask The great philosopher Socrates would challenge his students friends and even enemies to make new discoveries by asking them uncomfortable core questions which often led to new insights 4 Follow the flow of ideas To truly understand a concept discover how it evolved from simpler concepts Recognizing that the present real ity isa moment in a continuing evolution makes your understanding fit into a more coherent structure You cannot discover everything on your own You need to use the existing idea and improve it Edison was supremely successful at inventing product after product ex ploiting the maxim that every new idea has utility beyond its original intent He is credited with having said I start where the last man left off More poignantly he noted that many of lifes failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up 5 Change You need to shrug off a lifetimes habit of accepting a relatively superficial level of understanding and start learning more deeply You need to let go of the constraining forces in your life and let yourself fail on the road to success You should question all of the issues you have taken for granted all those years View every aspect of your world as a stream of insights and ideas Be amenable to change Each of us forever remains a work in progressalways evolving ever changing Were all rough drafts of the person were still becoming Learning is a lifelong journey Mungers speeches and essays are filled with the thoughts of the great thinkers from many different domains Munger reserves alot of time in his schedule for reading and has read hundreds of biographies He explains why he does so I believe in the discipline of master ing the best that other people have ever figured out I dont believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up yourself Nobodys that smart4 Munger provides a compelling argument for spending more time thinking reading learning and obtaining worldly wisdom And in todays digital age there is no dearth of resources to further this endeavor The Internet is the best school ever created The best peers are on the Internet The best books are on the Internet The best teachers are on the Internet The tools for learning are abundant Its the desire to learn thats scarce Naval Ravikant CHAPTER 4 HARNESSING THE POWER OF PASSION AND FOCUS THROUGH DELIBERATE PRACTICE You are what your deepest desire is As is your desire so is your intention As is your intention so is your will As is your will so is your deed As is your deed so is your destiny Upanishads Take up one idea Make that one idea your lifethink of it dream of it live on that idea Let the brain muscles nerves every part of your body be full of that idea and just leave every other idea alone This is the way to success Swami Vivekananda ccording to the Japanese everyone has an ikigaia reason for living And according to the residents of the Japanese village with the worlds longestliving people finding it is the key to a happy life Having a strong sense of ikigaiwhere passion mission vocation and profession intersectmeans that each day is infused with meaning Although there is no direct English translation the word ikigai is thought to combine the Japanese words ikiru meaning to live and kai meaning the realization of what one hopes for Together these definitions create the concept of a reason to live or the idea of having a purpose in life figure 41 Ikigai A Japanese concept meaning a reason for being Satisfaction but feeling of uselessness Delight and fullness but no wealth What you Love Passion What you are Good At Profession Comfortable What you Excitement and but feeling of can be complacency emptiness Paid For but sense of uncertainty Figure 41 Ikigai Source Thomas Oppong Ikigai The Japanese Secret toa Long and Happy Life Might Just Help You Livea More Fulfiling Life

calling The feeling is almost divine Ed Latimore The only way to deep happiness is to do something you love to the best of your ability Richard Feynman Your goal in life is to find out the people who need you the most to find out the business that needs you the most to find the project and the art that needs you the most There is something out there just for you Naval Ravikant According to Gordon Matthews professor of anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong how people understand ikigai can in fact often be mapped to two other Japanese ideasittaikan and jiko jitsugen Ittaikan refers to a sense of oneness with or commit ment to a group or role while jiko jitsugen relates more to selfrealization Selfrealization is closely linked to the concept of selfactualization best known in the field of psychology in the context of Abraham Maslows hierarchy of needs Selfactualized people are those who are fulfilled and are doing all that they are capable of Maslow described the good life as one directed toward selfactualization the higher need Selfactualization occurs when you maximize your potential by doing your best Maslow shared the names of those individuals he believed to be selfactualized including Abraham Lincoln Thomas Jefferson and Albert Einstein to elaborate the common characteristics of the selfactualized person According to humanistic psycholo gist Albert Ellis selfactualization involves the pursuit of excellence and enjoyment whichever people choose to desire and emphasize This focus on achieving excellence and enjoyment even more than a focus on the realization of potential prioritizes wellbeing and shows the relation between selfactualization and positive psychology Once we have discovered our calling in life we need to embrace the power of focus I fear not the man who has practiced 10000 kicks once but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10000 times Bruce Lee Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe Abraham Lincoln Those who attain any excellence commonly spend life in one pursuit for excellence is not often gained upon easier terms Samuel Johnson When Bill Gates met Warren Buffett for the first time their host at dinner Gatess mother asked everyone around the table what they believed was the single most important factor in their success in life Gates and Buffett gave the same oneword answer focus Both men agree that relentlessly focusing on one specific passion leads to achievement And that means pushing aside other ideas and interests until a goal is reached Intensity is the price of excellence Warren Buffett Buffett biographer Alice Schroeder writes about Buffetts intense focus He ruled out paying attention to almost anything but businessart literature science travel architectureso that he could focus on his passion2 This shouldnt come as a surprise Many of the highly successful people in the world attribute their success to a singular focusa deep commitment to the pursuit of one main goal Focus directs your energy toward your goals The more focused you are the more energy you put toward what youre working on Having the ability to focus on what is important and knowable is valuable in a world in which we are constantly bombarded with distracting and disparate ideas information and opinions This has important implications for investors Focus on those investments for which the microeconomics are going to dominate the outcome This approach will allow you to call upon your accumulated experience in analyzing companies and industries and to utilize the same to your advantage Fifty years ago the best investors were the ones with an informational edge Today the best investors are the ones with a behavioral edge As the speed of information dissemination in the mar kets and competition for shortterm outperformance among money managers increased over the years time horizons and patience levels significantly decreased Today an investors edge is less about knowing more than others about a specific stock and more about the mind set discipline and willingness to take a longterm view about the intrinsic value of a business Achievement is so ingrained in our culture that we often ignore the fact that gunning to maximize shortterm productivity usually comes at the expense of slower but more consistent and durable longterm progress We live in a society in which inactivity is often frowned upon but part of our focus should be not just on doing but also on deeply understanding the parameters of what we need to do now and in the future Learning and understanding the upfront and changing parameters of the field in which you are participating will help you focus on the right place As Albert Einstein said You have to learn the rules of the game And then you have to play better than anyone else These are incredibly powerful words in the context of focus Buffetts genius is that he prioritizes learning so that he can have higher quality insights Many people would see this as totally unproductive but many of my best business solutions and money problem answers have come from periods of just sitting and thinking Warren Buffett Ina knowledge economy learning and thinking are the best longterm investments you can make in your career Learning and thinking determine our decisions and those decisions in turn determine our results Buffett spends the major part of his daily time read ing and very little time actually taking action He says In allocating capital activity does not correlate with achievement Indeed in the fields of investments and acquisitions frenetic behavior is often counterproductive3 Investing is a field in which success can flow from passively observing the world reading thinking and doing nothing more than making an occasional telephone call Most investors would perform better if they thought more and did less One of the best hacks in the investment field is learning to be happy doing nothing Successful investing is a practical craft and is made up of heuristics a tool kit of approximate experiencebased rules for making sense of the world The rules are local rather than global and slowly change over timethey are sufficiently static to make experience valuable but sufficiently fluid to keep the craft interesting Having a strong passion for lifelong learning is a durable competitive advan tage for an investor What differentiates successful investors from mediocre ones is passion To be a truly passionate investor means you are always thinking about the future and the direction of the world It means you are always enthusiastically observing everything around you Investing isnt just a process of wealth creation it is a source of great happiness and sheer intellectual delight for the truly passionate investor It is great to be passionate in life but it is wise to be so only for things that are under our control or else we risk being dejected because of unfavorable outcomes Value investors derive satisfaction from the mental process of investing and from the learnings embed ded in the outcomes Those who love the process end up with results naturally unlike others who worship only outcomes The only way to gain an edge is through long and hard work Do what you love to do so you just naturally do it or think about it all the time even if you are relaxing Over time you can accumulate a huge advantage if it comes naturally to you like this emphasis added liLu Buffett has always held the opinion that the people who discover their passion in life are lucky His early passion for money manage ment resulted in his studying by age eleven every book the Omaha Public Library had on investing some of them twice Inan interview with Fortune magazine in 2012 Buffett was asked how other people can tap dance to work the way he does He provided the following answer Follow your passion always tell college students to take the job that you would take if you were independently wealthy By doing that the logic goes youll bring more energy to your work than anybody else does There is power in passion The truth is so few people really jump on their jobs you really will stand out more than you think Buffett explains You will get noticed if you really go for it As the wellknown saying goes Choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life You know that you are doing things right in your life when you go to bed at night and cannot wait to wake up and live the next day Instead of merely trying to live a long life we should endeavor to infuse life into our lives Too often life appears short to us because we all seem to have so much to do But the reality is that life is long if you know how to use it well Itis not that we havea short time to live but that we waste a lot of it Life is long enough and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity we are forced at last by deaths final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing So iti we are not given a short life but we make it short and we are not illsupplied but wasteful of it Life is long if you know how to use it Seneca Old too soon wise too late It is a sad irony that it often takes us a lifetime to learn to live in the moment To just be in the moment We put off living happily ever after for another year because we assume we have another year We dont tell the ones we love how much we love them often enough because we assume theres always tomorrow We ignore the warning of Socrates Beware the barrenness of a busy life Having all the money in the world is pointless if you dont have the time or the health to enjoy it In appendix A of this book I share a beautiful poem written by David Weatherford which I read a few years ago and continue to read from time to time It has inspired me to work toward changing my lifefrom deferring living for tomorrow to trying to live today as happily as possible We have two lives and the second begins when we realize we have only one Confucius When you find your North Star that is the most important thing that sets your lifes course you learn where youre headed And that is such a good feeling It is fine for your North Star to change over time But whatever it is right now let it guide you Your North Star is highly meaningful and vital in a personal context so aiming toward this beacon of light will bring great happiness to you every day Pursue your passion You wont get this time back ever again Life is but a pause between the first breath and the last The only thing you can guarantee at somebodys birth is his or her death everything else is unpredictable They say life is a journey from B to D thatis from birth to death But what about the C that comes between B and D It is choice Our life is a matter of choices Choose what makes you happy and your life will never go wrong Some people die at age twentyfive but arent buried until they are seventyfive Some people arent born until they are age twentyfive Strive to be the latter One day your life will flash before your eyes Make sure its worth watching Gerard Way In 2004 Steve Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and was informed that he only had a few weeks to live This is what Jobs told the audience during his 2005 Stanford commencement speech Remembering that Ill be dead soon is the most important tool Ive ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life Because almost everythingall external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failurethese things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose You are already naked There is no reason not to follow your heart emphasis added Your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life Dont be trapped by dogmawhich is living with the results of other peoples thinking Dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice And most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition emphasis added They somehow already know what you truly want to become Every thing else is secondary Jobs was echoing the thoughts of Mark Twain who said Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnt do than by the ones you did do So throw off the bowlines Sail away from the safe harbor Catch the trade winds in your sails Explore Dream Discover Twains quote reminds me of one of my favorite advertisements It came from United Technologies It runs Most of us miss out on lifes big prizes The Pulitzer The Nobel Oscars Tonys Emmys But were all eligible for lifes small pleasures Apat on the back A kiss behind the ear A fourpound bass A full moon An empty parking space A cracking fire A great meal A glorious sunset Hot soup Cold beer Dont fret about coping lifes grand awards Enjoy its tiny delights There are plenty for all of us2 And therein lies the big life lesson for all of us this moment is all that we have with us and we need to prioritize things we want to do now Take young children They are in a natural state of happiness they are neither stuck in the past nor living in anticipation of the future Enjoy the little things for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things Robert Brault The best things in life are not things They are experiences What we truly treasure in the long run comes from experiences Engag ing experiences trump material objects when it comes to deriving lasting happiness The pleasure derived from things is transitory but the joy that comes from experiences is enduring Dont chase things Make memories We are all on a journey No one lives forever Be gen erous to those who cross your path Give to those who need Touch hearts and spread happiness hope and optimism through your words and actions All our worries and plans about the future all of the replays in our minds of the bad things that happened in the past is all in our heads the human mind has a tendency to create issues out of nothing when its idle This worrying just distracts us from living fully right now Let go of all that and instead focus on what youre doing right at this moment You cannot reconstruct the framework of your reactions unless you deconstruct everything first which you can only do by leaving things behind Many events in life are outside our con trol So we should just let it go and continue putting our best foot forward every day In his Stanford speech Jobs shared the thought that would set the tone for the rest of his day For the past thirtythree years I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself If today were the last day of my life would I want to do what I am about to do today And whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row I know I need to change something These thoughts of Jobs are in alignment with the regret minimization framework espoused by Jeff Bezos When Bezos first considered starting Amazon he was working for D E Shaw one of the biggest quantdriven hedge funds on Wall Street Today in hindsight his decision looks like a nobrainer but at the time no one would have considered it a prudent career move to leave a wellpaying hedge fund job to start an online bookstore Mit freedom Hence what we perceive as interest is often distorted by societys expectations and becomes what we think we should become ing up ambition and genuine interest is a common phenomenon Because of societal constraints we never truly experience out of a fear based on beliefs Every big decision we make in life usually involves some sort of a tradeoff At times we have to accept small regrets to avoid large ones later Many people spend so much time worrying about the risks of taking action that they completely overlook the risks of failing to act Sure if you dont take any risk theres no failure associated No pain No pain Really Regrets will haunt you for the rest of your life Failure hurts but passes quickly Conversely regret hurts forever Its hard to look back and face the opportunities missed because of a lack of initiative Failure doesnt hurt as much as witnessing how fear led us to mistrust our intuition You only need to succeed once to unlock a new world of possibilities Regret is in the nondoing Many people are experts at success but amateurs at failure But not Bezos goals The framework I found which made the decision incredibly easy was what I calledwhich only a nerd would calla regret minimization framework So I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say Okay now Im looking back on my life I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal I knew that if I failed I wouldnt regret that but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried emphasis added I knew that that would haunt me every day and so when I thought about it that way it was an incredibly easy decision Ilove this framework because it doesnt involve a spreadsheet or a business plan It has more to do with personal fulfillment and life Once we have understood the significant importance of passion and focus in life how can we harness their power more effectively to achieve excellence in our respective fields By engaging in the process of deliberate practice Deliberate Practice Many performance coaches and motivational gurus preach the mantra of practice makes perfect Ten thousand hours of practice they say is the key to worldclass performance Malcolm Gladwell popularized this idea in his bestselling book Outliers The idea that excellence at performing a complex task requires a critical minimum level of practice surfaces again and again in stud ies of expertise In fact researchers have settled on what they believe is the magic number for true expertise ten thousand hours Of course this doesnt address why some people get more out of their practice sessions than others do emphasis added But no one has yet found a case in which true worldclass expertise was accomplished in less time It seems that it takes the brain this long to as similate all that it needs to know to achieve true mastery22 Notice the statement that this doesnt address why some people get more out of their practice sessions than others do Practice alone doesnt make perfect As James Clear says Motion does not equal action Busyness does not equal effectiveness In his book Talent Is Overrated Fortune magazine editor Geoff Colvin highlights studies that show that greatness can be developed by any individual in any field through the process of what he calls deliberate practice2 It is one of the big ideas from the science on human performance Deliberate practice is a highly structured activity with the specific goal of improving performance It requires continuous evalua tion feedback and a lot of mental effort Following are some of the key elements of deliberate practice 1 Its repeatable If youre a writer you write a lot If you are a musician you know the importance of repeating your notes 2 It receives constant feedback Learning occurs when you get lots of feedback tied closely in time to decisions and actions And deliberate practice constantly refers to resultsbased feedback No mistakes go unnoticed In fact every error is a crucial piece of information for further improvement The feedback can come from your observations or from a coach or mentor who notices the things that arent al ways visible to you 3 It is hard Deliberate practice takes significant mental effort 4 Itisnt much fun Most people dont enjoy doing activities that theyre not good at Its no fun to fail time and time again and to receive criticism about how to improve Yet deliberate practice is designed to focus specifically on those things you are weak at and this requires you to practice those skills repeatedly until you master them While practicing deliberately you are at the boundary of your limits and knowledge stretching out for a goal that is just a little out of reach When you reach for something the idea is pounded in even better Deliberate practice is all about having a bluecollar mindset In his book The Little Book of Talent Daniel Coyle wrote From a distance top performers seem to live charmed cushy lives When you look closer however youll find that they spend vast portions of their life intensively practicing their craft Their mindset is not entitled or arrogant its 100percent blue collar They get up in the morning and go to work every day whether they feel like it or not As the artist Chuck Close says Inspiration is for amateurs2 Finding our calling in life pursuing it with a strong passion and intense focus and engaging in deliberate practice results in ikigai Will Durant put it best when he said We are what we repeatedly do Excellence then is not an act but a habit SECTION II BUILDING STRONG CHARACTER CHAPTER 5 THE IMPORTANCE OF CHOOSING THE RIGHT ROLE MODELS TEACHERS AND ASSOCIATES IN LIFE Iwas lucky to have the right heroes Tell me who your heroes are and Ill tell you how youll turn out to be The qualities of the one you admire are the traits that you with a little practice can make your own and that if practiced will become habit forming Warren Buffett Good teachers in any field do far more than convey information they pass along something of themselves Peter Buffett eople who constantly strive to improve themselves usually have a role model This is a crucial aspect in the journey of selfimprove ment As creatures of comfort we are reluctant to step out of our comfort zone and we often lack the inner urge Because many of us are motivated by examples however we come to realize that the drive to improve can sometimes be found among othersor to be more precise can be driven by others Role models fill that position nicely and having them in our lives is an indicator that we intend to embark on a path of selfimprovement In his book The Education of a Value Investor Guy Spier writes about the importance of find ones role models in life There is no more important aspect of our education as investors businesspeople and human beings than to find these exceptional role models who can guide us on our own journey Books are a priceless source of wisdom But people are the ultimate teachers and there may be lessons that we can only learn from observing them or being in their presence In many cases these lessons are never communicated verbally Yet you feel the guiding spirit of that person when youre with them Role models act as our motivational coach and as a source of daily inspiration in our lives I have many role models and every year I discover new ones during the course of my journey You may wonder how one learns from his or her role model You need to read about the lives of these people what they have accomplished over the years and how they learned and then learn from their experiences Vicarious learning is valuable as our personal experience and insight is but a tiny fraction of the total experience and insight of humankind Teachers open the door but you must enter by yourself Chinese proverb The very instant when we come across our role model we usually know it The feeling we experience at that moment cannot be described in mere words it can only be experienced It is one of profound inspiration motivation and finding ones purpose in life Certain things you can do or questions you can ask will help you choose the most appropriate role models Look for the people who achieved results similar to the ones you are trying to achieve Look for people who have struggled with the same problems that you have in your life and try to understand how they overcame them Find someone whose life story is so inspirational that it simply uplifts you and motivates you Ifyou have trouble staying motivated or inspired look for someone who by their very actions inspires you in a specific way Ifyou lack discipline look for role models who have plenty of it and who teach others how to adopt their discipline and dedication It really is up to you First you should clearly define exactly what you are looking for After that you can more easily identify your role models As the saying goes When the student is ready the teacher will appear No discussion of role models can ever be complete without mentioning our parents Most of us have experienced the wide reach of their compassion Years of daily care Sleepless nights Endless worrying about our wellbeing Unconditional love Moral support during tough times Always give time to your parents We are so busy growing up that we often forget they are growing old Parents usually dont ask that we spend time with them but recognizing need is part of what makes one a person of value It is a wonderful feeling to care for our parents We have many ways to do this Showing appreciation for little acts Spending time together Making small gestures of love and affection This is all most parents want from us It is what gives them great happiness My noble mother taught me the virtues of honesty kindness and empathy My dear father constantly motivated me to push my limits and to improve He has been a great friend philosopher and guide and has given me the greatest gift anyone could give he believed in me I would like to make a special mention of my late maternal grandfather who taught me the virtues of hard work His eternal words of wisdom to me during my early teenage years had a profound and lasting impact on my life There is no alternative to hard work Throughout my childhood years I was a weak student I barely finished tenth grade My scores were so abysmally low that it was a struggle for me to gain admission to a decent high school It was only my subsequent awakening driven by a major personal setback that made me finally realize the virtues of hard work and determined effort and that was the catalyst for my academic revival and professional career growth And this is why I instantly related to legendary investor Arnold Van Den Bergs life when I read his inspirational words Lalways had this image of myself that I wasnt very smart and the way I did in school proved that I wasnt But Once I realized that if you dedicate yourself and you commit yourself you can learn anything I will admit this whatever I learn takes me three times as long as anybody else But if I spend three times as much time as anybody else then Im equal I can leamn it just give me more time more books Hang Out with People Better Than You and You Cannot Help but Improve In his 2002 shareholder letter Warren Buffett in his usual anecdotal way narrated the story of Eddie Lampert Eddie first lifted bats for the Chicago White Sox and the White Sox went to the World Series that year Later he switched to another team and that team too won the title And so onwherever Eddie went lady luck followed While fame and fortune followed Eddie Eddie didnt believe in his special powers According to Buffett Eddie understood that how he lugged bats was unimportant what counted instead was hooking up with the cream of those on the playing field Ive learned from Eddie At Berkshire I regularly hand bats to many of the heaviest hitters in American business emphasis added2 We all can learn a deep lesson here to be a winner work with winners One of Berkshires biggest strengths has been the group of managers running its subsidiaries and hitting home runs in the form of profitable growth with high rates of return Many names come to mind Ajit Jain Greg Abel Rose Blumkin Gene Abegg Tony Nicely Ralph Schey Chuck Huggins and Stan Lipsey Buffett and Charlie Mungers brilliance was to let managers of high caliber and integrity run their own businesses and then to stay out of their way Both Buffett and Munger often joke that they delegate at Berkshire almost to the point of abdication Nothing nothing at all matters as much as bringing the right people into your life They will teach you everything you need to know Guy Spier Surrounding yourself with smarter and better people provides a great education You gain firsthand experience of their thought processes how they prioritize if you want to know someones priorities in life observe what they do between Friday evening and Monday morning their value system how they live each day how they handle success and failure and many other important things that text books cannot teach you You get to experience a gravitational pull toward higher qualities It is better to be an average guy on a star team than a star on an average team The former will be better for you in the long term the latter is just an ego trip For most of my professional and personal life superior individuals made me feel uncomfortable And so I would seek out people who made me feel like I fit in This was clearly a wrong strategy If you are the smartest person in the room you are in the wrong room It is wiser to be with better people and to be uncomfortable than to limit yourself to a mediocre circle just to feel comfortable For instance if it were not for the generous help and guidance of my smart investor friends and colleagues then my personal portfolio would never have been able to perform as well as it did during the 201819 bear market in India I give them a large part of the credit for my healthy portfolio returns to date and I hope to always keep learning from them throughout life The people closest to you play an out size role in your level of success or failureso choose wisely You are after all the average of the five people you associate with the most in your life Deserved Trust Is Earned Of all forms of pride perhaps the most desirable is a justified pride in being trustworthy Charlie Munger Trust lies at the heart of any relationship In answer to the question What is trust Jack Welch the former chief of General Electric replied You know it when you feel itIt is one of the simplest and best definitions of trust We experience an echoing anxious feeling when trust is not present In such cases we hesitate to take the next step Conversely when trust is present we experience an open con nected feeling Trust creates the foundation of all relationships societies organizations nations and our entire civilization It is the oil that lubricates our entire economic and business system Trust drives risktaking which leads to innovation and progress We build trust by being honest in our communications By being authentic and sincere in both words and actions By being trans parent and admitting mistakes and sharing what we learn By being reliable and fair in our dealings with others Over time as you build your network put in your best efforts to constantly add value to others in your relationships and to build a seamless web of deserved trust figure BEING TWSTED BEING Teast omy Figure 51 Being trustworthy Source Behavior Gap In his speeches Munger often lists reliability as one of the essential traits for success He explains that although not many people can learn something like quantum mechanics anyone can learn reliability If you dedicate yourself to being reliable that alone can over come many failings or disadvantages you may have Munger often applauds McDonalds for teaching millions of teenagers the importance of reliably showing up for work Woody Allen said that 80 percent of success in life is just showing up Always reliably show up for the task entrusted to you Never overpromise and underdeliver Being unreliable will impair your career and friendships If anything underpromise and overdeliver Trust is earned when actions meet words In his book Pebbles of Perception Laurence Endersen writes Our ability to choose is one of lifes great gifts We are the product of our choices Good choices come from good character and a few good choices make all the difference Being reliable and trustworthy is one such choice CHAPTER 6 HUMILITY IS THE GATEWAY TO ATTAINING WISDOM Acknowledging what you dont know is the dawning of wisdom Charlie Munger ccording to Confucius real knowledge is knowing the extent of ones ignorance and this sentiment has been expressed by many A philosophers in one form or another Socrates for example put it quite bluntly when he said The only true wisdom is in know ing you know nothing Only if we approach learning with an open mind can we truly educate ourselves The wiser we become the more we realize how little we know A lesserknown and one of my alltime favorite equation from Albert Einstein rings true Ego 1 Knowledge More the knowledge lesser the ego lesser the knowledge more the ego The deeper one dives into any field the more humble one generally becomes also known as the DunningKruger effect By demonstrating intellectual humility and acknowledging what we dont know we place ourselves into a beneficial position to learn morethus the dawning of wisdom True ex pert knowledge in life and investing does not exist only varying degrees of ignorance This is not a problem to solve it is simply how the world works We cannot know everything but we can work hard to become just about smart enough to make aboveaverage decisions over time That is the key to successful compounding Ralph Waldo Emerson said Every man I meet is my master in some point and in that I learn of him Learning and accepting help from others creates value far beyond our individual capabilities Look at every interac tion as an opportunity to learn from the people you meet You will be amazed at how quickly you grow and how much better you become both as a professional and more important as a human being A tree that wants to touch the sky must extend its roots into the earth The more it wants to rise upward the more it has to grow downward Similarly to rise in life we need to be down to earth and humble Iwas born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there Richard Feynman Always question what you think you know and remember that every subject probably is more complex than we currently recog nize Such selfawareness creates a more accurate mental map of reality which in turn results in adopting language that more closely reflects the nuances of the world This is particularly true when we encounter absolutist wordssuch as never instead of seldom all instead of many and always instead of usually even etc is a powerful reminder that we are leaving things out A simple but effec tive way to remain selfaware is to add phrases like seems to me or so far as I know to these types of assertions You get the idea We never can be fully sure Humility Is the Essence of Life People couldnt believe that I suddenly made myself a subordinate partner to Warren But there are people that its okay to be a subordi nate partner to I didnt have the kind of ego that prevented it There always are people who will be better at something than you are You have to learn to be a follower before you become a leader People should learn to play all roles Charlie Munger The more you reach out to and associate with individuals whether younger or older who are better and smarter than you are the more you will learn and the faster you will improve Humility is the gateway to attaining wisdom Humility The constant desire to learn so that you can overcome ignorance Openmindedness to listen to what makes you un comfortable Humilityor lack of itis reflected through your actions Not asking Not learning from others All because you think you already know Truly humble people do not experience any uneasy feelings when someone younger but more successful or knowledgeable than them shares advice If youre truly happy and satisfied with the life youre leading youll be happy to see other people succeed Dont make this life all about you Be happy when other people are doing well and encourage their success When you support others it shows that youre not threatened by them because you are confident in your abilities Frank Wells was president of the Walt Disney Company from 1984 until his death in 1994 After Wells died his son found a little piece of paper in his wallet that read Humility is the essence of life Later it was discovered that Frank Wells had carried that note with him for thirty years We Never Can Be Fully Sure Doubt is not a pleasant condition but certainty is absurd Voltaire The quality of our lives is the sum of decision quality plus luck We look to learn from the results of our decisions to improve Our lives however are too short to collect enough data from our experiences to evaluate the quality of our decisions from the small set of results we experience We can only do so much to answer questions on our own We are only exposed to the information we encounter only live the experiences limited to our personal lives and only think of the hypothesis that we can conceive of Asa result it can be hard to know what reasons someone else could have for believing something different The best cure for overconfidence in your beliefs is to constantly remind yourself that you have experienced less than a tiny fraction of a percent of what has happened in the world This experience however ends up representing nearly 100 percent of how you believe the world works People tend to believe in what they have personally seen far more than what they read has happened to others We are all biased by our personal history Our installed beliefs are the result of our personal experiences in the past and they shape our visual prism If you have lived through hyperinflation or a severe bear market or were born in a poor family or have been discriminated against you already believe in something that people who have not experienced those things never will You likely also grossly overestimate the chance of those events happening again Morgan Housel offers a helpful suggestion to help us better empathize Start with the assumption that everyone is innocently out of touch and youll be more likely to explore whats going on through multiple points of view instead of cramming whats going on into the framework of your own experi ences Its hard to do Its uncomfortable when you do But its the only way to get closer to figuring out why people behave like they do Becoming Rich Versus Staying Rich Many people achieve success but to sustain the same and potentially build on it over an entire lifetime requires humility gratitude and a constant learning mindset Becoming rich often becomes the biggest obstacle to staying rich Winning big makes many of us feel invin cible and that feeling entices us to bet big on what worked for us in the recent past This ends up creating a catastrophic event when the world changes or luck turns against us Housel writes It goes like this The more successful you are at something the more convinced you become that youre doing it right The more convinced you are that youre doing it right the less open you are to change The less open you are to change the more likely you are to tripping in a world that changes all the time There are a million ways to get rich But theres only one way to stay rich Humility often to the point of paranoia The irony is that few things squash humility like getting rich in the first place Its why the composition of Dow Jones companies changes so much over time and why the Forbes list of billionaires has 60 percent turnover per decade Humility doesnt mean taking fewer risks Sequoia takes as big of risks today as it did 30 years ago But its taken risks in new industries with new approaches and new partners cognizant that what worked yesterday isnt what will work tomorrow2 Absolute certainty never exists in the world of finance Yet on Wall Street overconfidence is allpervasive Jason Zweig highlights the hubris of investors in his definitions of certainty and uncertainty in his book The Devils Financial Dictionary CERTAINTY An imaginary state of clarity and predictability in economic and geopolitical affairs that all investors say is indis pensableeven though it doesnt exist never has and never will The most fundamental attribute of financial markets is uncertainty UNCERTAINTY The most fundamental fact about human life and economic acti on Wall Street it is nonexistent2 ity In the real world uncertainty is ubiquitous Contrast the kind of egotism found on Wall Street with the humility of one of the greatest minds outside of finance Richard Feyn man We should all learn from this great teacher who humbly admits that nothing is ever certain We know that all our statements are approximate statements with different degrees of certainty that when a statement is made the question is not whether it is true or false but rather how likely it is to be true or false Investing is no different Approximate statements and different degrees of certainty require us to think probabilistically The ques tion is not Will I be right or will Ibe wrong The question should be What is the probability of this scenario versus another and how does this information affect my assessment of value We must always leave room for doubt even in those ideas that hold our highest con viction Otherwise we risk becoming complacent An attitude of knowing everything makes it difficult to learn anything According to Feynman before you begin any task you first must not know the answer We must begin by being uncertain about the answer Otherwise how can we learn This may sound like com mon sense but it is not so common in the world of finance Acknowledging that we do not know something is much more beneficial than having the incorrect answers If we can be certain of one thing it is that we can never be fully sure We must learn to live with doubt and embrace uncertainty We shouldnt feel anxious about not knowing things Rather we should welcome it Because the realization of not knowing something is an opportunity to learn In sci ence I dont know is not an indication of a failure but rather is a necessary first step toward enlightenment As Feynman puts it The question of doubt and uncertainty is what is necessary to begin for if you already know the answer there is no need to gather any evidence about it Thave approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things but Im not abso lutely sure of anything and there are many things I dont know anything about The first source of difficulty is that it is imperative in science to doubt it is absolutely necessary for progress in science to have uncertainty as a fundamental part of your inner nature To make progress in understanding we must remain modest and allow that we do not know Nothing is certain or proved beyond all doubt You investigate for curiosity because it is unknown not because you know the answer And as you develop more information in the sciences it is not that you are finding out the truth but that you are finding out that this or that is more or less likely There are few absolute truths in investing The best we can do is gather evidence as diligently as possible to assess the likelihood of various outcomes We do this by connecting various pieces of the puzzle and trying to put them together in a way that makes sense We are constantly exploring We are constantly looking for new evidencetrying to find out more about what we know and to better under stand what we dont know After we gather the evidence we must study the same What did we learn What does that imply for our original hypothesis How likely is it that we are correct Are there other factors we failed to consider that may have led to different results or conclusions Investors are often too anxious to jump to conclusions that support their original thinking Confirmation bias is difficult to resist Again we should learn from Feynman If we investigate further we find that the statements of science are not of what is true and what is not true but statements of what is known to different degrees of certainty It is very much more likely that so and so is true than that it is not true or such and such is almost certain but there is still a little bit of doubt or at the other extreme well we really dont know Every one of the concepts of science is on a scale graduated somewhere between but at neither end of absolute falsity or absolute truth It is of great value to acknowledge ignorance Investors have a difficult time acknowledging the presence of uncertainty But uncertainty remains the most fundamental attribute of financial markets Living in an imaginary world of certainty can lead to potentially fatal mistakes in the real world of finance The sooner we accept that we live in an uncertain worldthat we dont have all the answersthe sooner we can begin trying to become wiser This understanding is vital Once accepted it shapes our worldview and becomes a natural way of thinking Incorporating uncertainty in the way we think about what we believe creates openmindedness to alternative hypotheses moving us closer to a more objective stance toward information that does not align with what we believethat is truth seeking With respect to investing intellectual humility is best illustrated through the concept of the circle of competence The Circle of Competence Im no genius but Im smart in spots and I stay around those spots Tom Watson Sr Warren Buffett has always advised investors to focus on operating only in areas they understand best In HBOs documentary Becoming Warren Buffett he compared his investing strategy to Americas favorite pastime referencing baseball legend Ted Williamss book The Science of Hitting in which the allstar slugger emphasized the importance of knowing your sweet spot If he waited for the pitch that was really in his sweet spot he would bat 400 If he had to swing at something on the lower corner he would probably bat 235 The lesson for investors Buffett says is that we dont have to swing at every pitch The trick in investing is just to sit there and watch pitch after pitch go by and wait for the one right in your sweet spot And if people are yelling Swing you bum ignore them Just as Williams only swung at pitches in his sweet spot Buffett only invests in companies that are within his circle of compe tence a concept he described for the first time in his 1996 letter to shareholders What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evalu ate selected businesses Note that word selected You dont have to be an expert on every company or even many You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence The size of that circle is not very important knowing its boundaries however is vital emphasis added This means that as investors we need to restrict ourselves only to those businesses whose longterm economics we can under stand For most investors investing outside ones circle of competence is what often leads to big losses One should not blindly chase buzzing stocks or get swayed by exciting stories narratives or futuristic concepts because these kinds of businesses usually have unproven track records or they lack profitability and cash flow The key idea behind the circle of competence is not its sizethe absolute number of businesses you can understandbut your awareness about its sizethe kind of businesses you know you can understand It is not important how big that circle is What matters is how well you have defined its perimeter Investors who are intellectually honest and humble are always willing to admit their limitations and to stay within their area of expertise So how do you find your circle of competence Instead of picking what you know use the inversion technique popularized by Charlie Munger to create your circle of competence Inspired by the German mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi Munger explains Invert always invert Tum a situation or problem upside down Look at it backward What happens if all our plans go wrong Where dont we want to go and how do you get there Instead of looking for success make a list of how to fail insteadthrough sloth envy resentment selfpity entitlement all the mental habits of selfdefeat Avoid these qualities and you will succeed Tell me where Im going to die that is so I dont go there2 Try to know the things you dont know and then draw a circle that keeps those things out This is very much what scientists do They approach a problem and its solution by trying to prove it is false not that it is true In investing risk comes from not knowing what you are doing In fact Buffett considers this to be one of the biggest risks in invest ing So much so that he avoids using equity risk premiums to value stocks confining himself only to those situations about which he is highly certain Buffett uses the interest rate of longterm US Treasury bonds to value stocks except when he believes it is artificially low During those times he adds a few percentage points to his discount rate He says I put a heavy weight on certainty If you do that the whole idea of a risk factor doesnt make sense to me Risk comes from not knowing what youre doing In a similar vein Buffett adds We dont discount the future cash flows at 9 percent or 10 percent we use the US Treasury rate We try to deal with things about which we are quite certain You cant compensate for risk by using a high discount rate At the 1998 Berkshire annual meeting Buffett explained how he thinks about risk when evaluating any business When we look at the future of businesses we look at riskiness as being sort of a gonogo valve In other words if we think that we simply dont know whats going to happen in the future that doesnt mean its risky for everyone It means we dont knowthat its risky for us It may not be risky for someone else who understands the business However in that case we just give up We dont try to predict those things We dont say Well we dont know whats going to happen Therefore well discount some cash flows that we dont even know at 9 percent instead of 7 percent That is not our way to approach it2 How does such strict adherence to his circle of competence greatly help Buffett in investing He explains If we have a business about which were extremely confident as to the business results wed prefer that its stock have high volatility Well make more money in a business where we know what the end game will be if it bounces around a lot2 If you know things you dont knowyour circle of incompetenceyou will automatically get to what you do knowyour circle of competence Once you have defined your circle of incompetence draw your personal circle just as Buffett did Buffetts investing process involves creating three lists of companiesin simple and easytounderstand businesses out difficult to understand and too hard so complex that it is not worth devoting any time to understanding them Buffett once said that 99 percent of the stock ideas that came to him fell into the too hard category Just think about that for a minute In Buffett we have arguably the greatest investor who has ever lived admitting that he does not understand 99 percent of the businesses he comes across The next time you feel you know it all reflect deeply on that fact A genuine and honest adherence to ones circle of competence is a deeply humbling experience Let me share a personal example to illustrate In January 2018 I came across the most recent edition of Indian Economy Market magazine which contained investment thesis reports on 75 Hid den Gems many of which had been written by my respected seniors and peers I could properly understand only one name out of seventy five This is perfectly acceptable Remember it is not a competency if you dont know the edge of it Venturing outside these edges is what gets investors into big trouble Warren and I know better than most people what we know and what we dont know Thats even better than having a lot of extra IQ points People chronically misappraise the limits of their own knowledge thats one of the most basic parts of human nature Knowing the edge of your circle of competence is one of the most difficult things for a human being to do Knowing what you dont know is much more useful in life and business than being brilliant emphasis added Charlie Munger One sign of emotional intelligence is the ability to admit error A mistake denied is a lesson not learned Reflect deeply and objectively evaluate your performance It is only through an honest selfassessment that an investor can discover his or her circle of com petence A key benefit of emotional intelligence is the intellectual honesty to view the world as it really is not as one wants it to be hopes it to be or wishes it to be My investing strike rate improved significantly once I acknowledged what I do not know and stayed within my circle of competence The basic idea behind the circle of competence is so simple it is embarrassing to say it out loud when you are unsure and doubtful about what you want to do do not do it If you cant find businesses within your circle of competence dont hurriedly step outside that circle because of the fear of missing out which is often the case in a bull market Instead spend time studying industries and companies outside your circle before crossing the boundaries The biggest advantage of developing ones circle of competence over time is that different industries and types of compa nies are in favor at different stages of the market cycle Having an expanded opportunity set at ones disposal to choose from can prove to be highly profitable at such times Again its not important how big your circle of competence is What is critical is to clearly know where the edges are Its not a competency if you dont know the edge of it it Charlie Munger Now you may well ask But how do I expand those edges so that I can enlarge my circle of competence There is a simple way to do Its simple but not easy Read A lot That is the only way you can expand your circle of competence For example read a book called Analyzing and Investing in Community Bank Stocks and then read the annual reports of a few commu nity banks These are relatively easier to understand and value Or pick an industry in which you have some expertise and begin reading the annual reports of the companies in that industry Ilearned early in my career that if you read the annual reports youve done more than 90 percent of the people on Wall Street If you read the notes to the annual report youve done more than 95 percent of the people on Wall Street Jim Rogers In investing the person that turns over the most rocks wins the game There is no alternative to hard work In life relationships business or investing nothing will work unless you do And there is no intelligent reason for an investor to settle for an inferior track record in a marketplace filled with companies with outstanding fundamentals Ive always said that if you look at ten companies youll find one thats interesting If you look at 20 youll find two if you look at 100 youll find ten The person that turns over the most rocks wins the game Its about keeping an open mind and doing a lot of work The more industries you look at the more companies you look at the more opportunity you have of finding something thats mis priced emphasis added Peter Lynch Buffett once remarked Back in 1951 Moodys published thick handbooks by industry of every stock in circulation I went through all of them thousands of pages motivated by the hope that a great idea was just on the next page I found companies like National American Insurance and Western Insurance Securities Company that nobody was paying attention to that were trading for far less than their intrinsic val ues Last year we found a steel company on the Korean Stock Exchange that had no analyst coverage no research but was the most profitable steel company in the world2 Buffetts story reminds me of a few of my experiences Every day I diligently review all of the corporate announcements on the Bombay Stock Exchange BSE website It is a painstaking exercise for many but for me itis like an intellectual treasure hunt wherein I may strike gold at any time Every day I create numerous opportunities for serendipity to find me My personal investment opportunity set has significantly expanded over the years with time and experience in the markets Initially it was restricted only to secular growth stocks at reasonable to expensive valuations But now it covers multiple areas of the in vestment universe including commodities cyclicals deep value and spinoffs as well as lossmaking companies that are turning around as reflected in slow gradual changes low contrast in their improving balance sheet working capital margins or a significant positive change in their industry dynamics Instead of being restricted by my personal biased views to a small opportunity set as was the case during my early years am now able to invest in a variety of industries and situations wherever I find mispricing of value and a highly fa vorable riskandreturn tradeoff Markets continually change It also reminds me to look for investment opportunities in different markets rather than keep going back to a well that is dry Robert Kiyosaki No single strategy works all of the time and in every kind of market Thats why its essential to build up ones investing arsenal to be able to hunt for value from within different areas Over the years I have come to realize and appreciate just why this is critically important a bull market is always going on at all times in some specific sectors of the stock market For instance even during the 20092013 bear market in India consumer discre tionary pharmaceutical and information technology companies created a lot of wealth for investors New trends always emerge during a bear marketthats the period during which most investors are either waiting for their purchase price or are busy committing fresh sins by averaging the winning leader stocks bought during the previous bull market The number of retail investors in a sector tends to go up during its bullish phase so during the subsequent bear market for the sector relentless selling usually occurs at every higher level as old investors try their best to exit and rid themselves of bad memories Where should we devote our limited time in life to achieve maximum success Munger gives us the answer You have to figure out what your own aptitudes are If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you dont youre going to lose And thats as close to certain as any prediction that you can make You have to figure out where youve got an edge And youve got to play within your own circle of competence2 The takeaway from Buffett and Munger is clear If you want to improve your odds of success in life business and investing then clearly define the perimeter of your circle of competence and operate only inside it Over time work to expand that circle but never fool yourself about its current boundaries As Feynman says The first principle is that you must not fool yourselfand you are the easiest person to fool The following hypothetical conversation captures the essence of the dawning of wisdom Philosopher What are the three wisest words in investing Value investor Margin of safety Philosopher Wrong Value Investor Then Philosopher I dont know CHAPTER 7 THE VIRTUES OF PHILANTHROPY AND GOOD KARMA If you are in the luckiest 1 percent of humanity you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99 percent Warren Buffett humble and inculcates a sense of detachment in us The process of creating wealth should motivate us to give our best but the results should be surrendered for the betterment of humanity after we have taken care of our needs We are able to create wealth only with the help of others so giving back also needs to be part of our planning O ne of the important teachings of the Bhagavad Gita is to develop a trusteeship attitude toward material wealth This keeps us If you are fortunate to have earned or inherited more than you need to live out your personal definition of a good life you will have the opportunity and the responsibility to decide where and how to direct the surplus funds Most individuals in this situation focus on two kinds of beneficiaries both of which can be deeply meaningful family members and philanthropic organizations such as schools colleges hospitals and religious organizations The latter giving back to society is a highly noble activity You can derive a great deal of happiness and personal fulfillment from the act of making a positive difference in other peoples lives The best value investment of all is channeling money into goals that will make your life more valuable drawing out your innate gifts to make yourself matter to other people and to make the world around you a better place Jason Zweig Blessed is the investor who uses his wealth to do good for others Charles Collier writes in his guidebook on philanthropy Wealth in Families that according to Aristotle and his latterday student Thomas Jefferson the pursuit of happiness has to do with an internal journey of learning to know ourselves and an external journey of service of others The meaning you give to wealth says a lot about you and the way you will be seen and remembered That is why developing an en vironment of shared values with your family is so important Devote time to introducing your will sharing your values and feelings with those you love This also may be an opportune time to ensure good things for others after your death by creating the appropriate provi sions for future philanthropic activities in your formal will It may be your last opportunity to be heard and for your future wishes to be adhered to Life is unpredictable On Maslows needs hierarchy selftranscendence ranks even higher than selfactualization and refers to the highest and most in clusive or holistic level of human consciousness Selftranscendence can be experienced when we move beyond ourselves to see a greater fulfillment linked directly with serving the needs of others Givers greatly enjoy seeing the wealth they have created during their working lives come to life again by enabling good things to happen during their lifetimes for targeted causes that carry significant meaning to them As the adage goes You cant take it with you Givers derive great happiness from converting their financial resources into actions and values they truly care about figure 71 your Your HAPPINESS You use oF Mole y Figure 71 Giving and happiness Source Behavior Gap Asa philanthropist Warren Buffett is best known for giving billions of dollars to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and for sup porting the philanthropic work of his three children He also generously gives to other groups like the Glide Foundation an antipoverty charity in San Francisco In philanthropy as in business supporting the right people is more important than all other factors according to Buffett When I buy businesses its the same as investing in philanthropy Im looking for somebody who will get the job done and is in synch with my goals You can have the greatest goals in the world but if you have the wrong people running it it isnt going to work On the other hand if youve got the right person running it almost anything is possible2 Value for ones money is as important in philanthropy as it is in investing Notable philanthropists who Buffett admires include Andrew Carnegie Peter Kiewit and John D Rockefeller The problem of our age Carnegie argued in an 1889 article in the North American Review is the proper administration of wealth The wealthy should use their riches to improve public facilities that would enable the deserving poor to help themselves Carnegie said because this kind of philanthropy is best calculated to dolasting good Carnegie rose from being a penniless immigrant to become the wealthiest man in the world at his time His vision was to create an ideal state in which the surplus wealth of the few will become in the best sense the property of the many After selling his steel empire for 500 million Carnegie donated his wealth for the creation of schools for a peace endowment for New Yorks Carnegie Hall and for the acquisition and installation of 7689 church organs But it was his keen support for library construction that became the most visible manifestation of his philosophy Carnegies philanthropy enabled the construction of 2811 public libraries across the United States Kiewit grew his familys business from the twelfthlargest contractor in Omaha to one of the largest and most respected in the entire United States Before he died Kiewit directed that his personal estate should be used to establish a foundation to support public purpose projects in Nebraska and western Iowa The Peter Kiewit Foundation opened its doors in 1979 with a 150 million endowment representing more than 90 percent of the fortune earned by Kiewit during his lifetime Upon Peter Kiewits death Buffett shared his feel ings Peter Kiewit made major deposits in societys bankbut his withdrawals have been few Kiewit gave generously while he was alive and gave away the majority of his net worth upon his death Rockefellers charitable giving began with his first job as a clerk at age sixteen when he gave 6 percent of his earnings to charity By the time he was twenty his charity exceeded 10 percent of his income As Rockefellers wealth grew so too did his giving primarily to educational and public health causes basic science and the arts He was reportedly influenced by a meeting in 1893 with Swami Vivekananda who enlightened him on the virtues of helping the needy We all can take a big lesson from Rockefellers life It is never too early to start giving and helping others To make a difference in someones life you dont have to be brilliant rich or perfect You just need to care I did not want to deprive myself of the happiness from giving so during my initial years in the United States even when I was earning minimum wage as a front desk clerk at a hotel in San Francisco began donating to local charities starting with small sums as low as 10 in some cases when that was all I could afford at the time It doesnt matter where you are or if you have a little to give or a lot to give something happens to your heart when you share with others Something that changes you for the better Love is doing small things with great love It is not how much we do but how much love we put in the doing It is not how much we give but how much love we put in the giving To God there is nothing small Mother Teresa Over time as my wealth has increased so too have my charitable contributions and it gives me great happiness to put a smile on the face of those who are less privileged I was delighted when a dear friend and I jointly won the bidding auction in November 2018 for the annual charity lunch with Mohnish Pabrai the entire proceeds of which would go to benefit the Dakshana Foundation Writing about and sharing my lifes biggest learnings is my way of giving back to the investing community Our goodwill compounds when we share with others We should act as a funnel not a sponge As Charlie Munger so beautifully puts it The best thing a human being can do is to help another human being know more In life the winners also lose occasionally but those who help others win can never lose So always help others rise This is how goodwill compounds over time Karma Is Like a Big Snowball You cant live a perfect day without doing something for someone who will never be able to repay you John Wooden The most meaningful way to succeed is to help other people succeed Adam Grant Selflessly helping others in an unconditional manner without expecting any favors in return has great virtue My sincere work ethic and helpful attitude toward my coworkers at my previous investment banking jobs encouraged them to share positive feedback about me when my current employer contacted them during the initial background checks conducted after my job interview In addition from time to time my previous investment banking teammates generously helped me by imparting a solid understanding of the insurance and asset management industries in India from which many initial public offerings came during 2017 and 2018 This in turn helped me make bet ter decisions about some of my existing holdings which had a presence in insurance and asset management businesses How you behave in one place will help in surprising ways later Charlie Munger Recall a key lesson from an earlier chapter we should endeavor to constantly add value to others in our relationships on our own initiative without expecting anything in return In September 2017 a senior investor with whom I had previously spoken a couple of times alerted me to some scuttlebutt about one of my portfolio companies being unable to pay its factory workers and that it would de fault on the upcoming interest payment on its debt This turned out to be a timely warning Just a few days later news broke in the media that this company was trying to defraud its lenders by artificially inflating its asset size on its books of accounts to get bigger loans from the banks The stock promptly declined by almost 30 percent in the next few days Thanks to my seniors timely warning I was able to exit the stock a few days earlier at a handsome profit When I called my senior to thank him and ask why he had helped me by sharing such sensitive information these were his words Because you always used to share helpful company and industry data with me from time to time even when I never asked you for it You helped me then I helped you now I believe this positive feedback loop always exists when you engage in the smallest of good acts for others The acts tend to take a whole circle and return to bless you with positive things in your life Karma is like a big snowball Ask yourself at the end of each day Did I do at least one good act to help someone today After that thank the Almighty and your parents in your prayers for all that they have given to youin life I do this ritual every day and it gives me great inner peace No wonder Michael Jacksons song Heal the World has res onated so strongly with me ever since I first heard it many years ago CHAPTER 8 SIMPLICITY IS THE ULTIMATE SOPHISTICATION Most geniusesespecially those who lead othersprosper not by deconstructing intricate complexities but by exploiting unrecognized simplicities Andy Benoit Life is really simple but we insist on making it complicated Confucius implicity is the result of long hard work not the starting point The ability to reduce something to its essence is the true mark of understanding But one of the great ironies in life is that when the smartest minds generously share the secrets of their success with us we ignore them because they sound too basic and simple for us to appreciate Thats it It cant be so simple we say when we hear them giving us simple advice to achieve greatness Consider investing When we read Warren Buffetts revelation of the only two rules of successful investingRule number 1 Never lose money Rule number 2 Never forget rule number 1we protest Great thought but is that it It cant be so simple Investing is simple but not easy Warren Buffett Inan interview with Business Wire in November 2011 Buffett said If you understand chapters 8 and 20 of The Intelligent Investor Benjamin Graham 1949 and chapter 12 of The General Theory John Maynard Keynes 1936 you dont need to read anything else and you can turn off your TV2 This advice from Buffett references two classics from the field of investing and economics Chapter 8 of Grahams book talks about not letting the mood swings of Mr Market coax us into speculating selling in panic or try ing to time the market Chapter 20 explains that after careful analysis of a companys ongoing business and its prospects for future earnings we should consider buying only if its current price implies a large margin of safety In chapter 12 of The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money The State of LongTerm Expectation Keynes remarks that most professional investors and speculators were largely concerned not with making superior longterm forecasts of the probable yield of an investment over its whole life but with foreseeing changes in the conventional basis of valuation a short time ahead of the gen eral public Buffett took the simple but fundamental truths of investing from these three chapters quite seriously and applied them throughout his life with a high degree of intensity and it has made him one of the wealthiest individuals in the world Take a simple idea and take it seriously Charlie Munger The simple ideas with intensity of pursuit is what gets you to the promised land Mohnish Pabrai_ Buffetts key takeaway from The Intelligent Investor was this If you eliminate the downside then all that remains is the upside After that the key is to keep emotions in check and be patient It really is that simple Its simple but not easy In the world of securities courage becomes the supreme virtue after adequate knowledge and a tested judgment are at hand Benjamin Graham Many newcomers in the investing field consider The Intelligent Investor to be too dry and not exciting enough It does not reveal any secrets to finding the next big multibagger and it does not offer any shortcuts for making money quickly But as I have realized through my multiple readings of this book it does build the character and steely resolve required to become a good investor And character building as compared with wealth building is a much more difficult subject to read about and practice For the former refer to Rudyard Kiplings poem If in appendix B Mohnish Pabrais book The Dhandho Investor is one of the more accessible books written on value investing Just like Buffett Pabrai has a gift for simplifying complex sounding ideas In his book he writes Every business has an intrinsic value and it is determined by the same simple formula John Burr Williams was the first to define it in his The Theory of Investment Value published in 1938 Per Williams the intrinsic value of any business is determined by the cash inflows and outflowsdiscounted at an appropriate interest ratethat can be expected to occur during the remaining life of the business The definition is painfully simple Simplicity is a very powerful construct Henry Thoreau recognized this when he said Our life is frittered away by detail simplify simplify Einstein also recognized the power of simplicity and it was the key to his breakthroughs in physics He noted that the five ascending levels of intellect were Smart Intelligent Brilliant Genius Simple For Einstein simplicity was simply the highest level of intellect Everything about Warren Buffetts investment style is simple It is the thinkers like Einstein and Buffett who fixate on simplicity who triumph The genius behind E mc is its simplicity and eleganceé The Simplest Solution Often Tends to Be the Best The grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms Albert Einstein Occams razor named after fourteenthcentury English logician William of Ockham is a principle of parsimony economy or succinctness used in logic and problem solving It states that among competing hypotheses the hypothesis with the fewest assumptions should be selected Other more complicated solutions ultimately may prove to provide better predictions but in the absence of differences in predic tive ability the fewer assumptions that are made the better Investors should remember that their scorecard is not computed using Olympicdiving methods Degreeofdifficulty doesnt count emphasis added If you are right about a business whose value is largely dependent on a single key factor that is both easy to un derstand and enduring the payoff is the same as if you had correctly analyzed an investment alternative characterized by many constantly shifting and complex variables Warren Buffett The way Buffett deals with difficult problems is to avoid them altogether Unlike the figure skaters at the Olympics we dont get extra points for higher degrees of difficulty in investing Originality and complexity are not necessary or sufficient conditions for gen erating superior longterm returns As investors our job is simply to compound capital over time at the highest possible rate with the minimum amount of risk We achieve this objective by seeking out undervalued stocks of companies within our circle of competence Be completely indifferent to whether the market cap is large or small or to whether the company is relatively unknown or widely followed Investing is not about being original or creative it is about looking for the greatest amount of value for the price paid with the least amount of risk Putting in more time and effort does not guarantee better results in investing Rather it is more beneficial to do less and make fewer but better choices The more decisions you make the less willpower you have Its called decision fatigue Focus on making fewer and better decisions This allows you sufficient time to think about each decision deeply and reduces the chances of making a mistake We should restrict our selves only to those cases in which the investment decision looks like a nobrainer As Charlie Munger says The goal of investment is to find situations where it is safe not to diversify Look for simple businesses that require fewer assumptions and fewer hypothetical scenarios to work out and that do not require discounting cash flows from way out into the future to justify the investment As Thomas Carlyle aptly put it Our main business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance but to do what lies clearly at hand In his 2004 letter Buffett highlighted the importance of sticking to simple propositions If only one variable is key to a decision and the variable has a 90 percent chance of going your way the chance for a successful outcome is obviously 90 percent But if ten independent variables need to break favorably for a successful result and each has a 90 percent probability of success the likelihood of having a winner is only 35 percent Since a chain is no stronger than its weakest link it makes sense to look forif youll excuse an oxymoronmonolinked chains It is important to identify and focus on the few key variables that really matter to an investment decision This vastly simplifies the process and improves the probability of a successful outcome The Occams razor mental model is useful because it enables us to separate the longterm signal from the shortterm noise and to calmly think through any investing decision Yes reading the annual re ports filings press releases and footnotes to the accounts is important and occasionally we will be able to dig out some extra detail that might give us an analytical advantage but in my view understanding the big picture the two to three key variables that really matter is equally if not more important Some of us may be average at business valuation but still can achieve aboveaverage results by being able to better put the available information in the appropriate context by remembering the big picture and by being able to pinpoint the few factors that really matter to an investment Inone of his lectures at Columbia University Joel Greenblatt taught his students the importance of always keeping the big picture in mind Explain the big picture Your predecessors failed over a long period of time It has nothing to do about their ability to doa spread sheet It has more to do with the big picture I focus on the big picture Think of the logic not just the formula In investing simplicity is the way to longterm success Buffett says The business schools reward difficult complex behavior more than simple behavior but simple behavior is more effective We havent succeeded because we have some great complicated systems or magic formulas we apply or anything of the sort What we have is just simplicity itself simplicity is the art of thoughtful reduction It is a systematic falsification of deeply held beliefs Conan Doyles fictional character Sherlock Holmes once said If you eliminate the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth In contrast com plexity opens you up to far more possibilities and surprises possibly in a harmful way Buffett has been emphasizing the idea of simplification for a long time He wrote in his 1992 shareholder letter We try to stick to businesses we believe we understand That means they must be relatively simple and stable in character If a business is complex or sub ject to constant change were not smart enough to predict future cash flows Incidentally that shortcoming doesnt bother us Munger agrees We have a passion for keeping things simple If something is too hard we move on to something else What could be more simple than that12 Observe how Munger is able to greatly simplify the path to wealth creation Spend less than you make always be saving something Put it into a taxdeferred account Over time it will begin to amount to something This is such a nobrainer Intelligent people are drawn to complex solutions Plenty of smart and highly educated people work in the world of finance But that intelligence often comes at a cost because smart people can more easily fool themselves into believing they have all the answers That can get them into big trouble As Albert Einstein said If you cant explain it simply you dont understand it well enough According to William James The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook This is true not just for business prob lems but for people as well As Buffett cautions You cant make a good deal with a bad person2 This is precisely the philosophy he has followed in his business and personal life He has chosen to work only with people he admires and trusts As a result he has rarely had to deal with nasty problems created by bad people Although Occams razor is a useful mental model it should not be seen as a substitute for empirical testing It relies on subjective assessment of simplicity and looks for approximate or good enough solutions to the problems at hand also known as satisficing It is not a rule It is more of a guide or a suggestion Sherlock Holmes would look for the simplest most natural explanation for a case but he also believed in not oversimplifying com plex matters especially when dealing with systems involving complicated interactions Similarly Albert Einstein believed in the power of simplicity but he also understood its limitations Everything should be made as simple as possible but no simpler For example the reason for the popularity of the pricetoearnings PE ratio is its simplicity and accessibility A ratio of 20x simply means that a company is available at a market capitalization that is twenty times its annual earnings In other words the stock price is trading at twenty times its earnings per share The PE ratio in isolation however tells us nothing about the businesss capital intensity cash flow generation management quality or balance sheet strength or about the expected duration of its competitive advantage period Theres a lot more to making money in the stock market than just looking at PE ratios Every investor should diligently study the white papers titled What Does a PriceEarnings Multiple Mean and The PE Ratio A Users Manual by Michael Mauboussin and Epoch Invest ment Partners respectively12 Three Steps to Simplification Complexity is about tactics simplicity is about systems Tactics come and go but an overarching philosophy about the way the world works can help you make better decisions in multiple scenarios Simple doesnt go out of style but complex does Ben Carlson The first step in simplification is to avoid wasting time on things that are unknowable and unimportant Before attacking a problem ask whether it is important and worth solving Buffett explains There are two questions you ask yourself as you look at the decision youll make A Is it knowable B Is it important If it is not knowableas you know there are all kinds of things that are important but not knowablewe forget about those And if its unimportant whether its knowable or not it wont make any difference We dont care1 Which way the interest rates will move what the stock market is going to do next where the economy is headed and so on are all important but unknowable The second step for simplification is focus When we try to accomplish too many things simultaneously we end up doing all of them poorly Attention is a scarce resource that gets depleted throughout the day Yet we act as if it can be divided unlimitedly with no negative consequence Decisionmaking is more effective when we focus on one thing at a time Multiple research studies have shown time and again that the human brain is not optimized for multitasking especially when one is working on complicated and unfamiliar tasks One of the hardest things to do in life is to avoid good opportunities so that you have time to devote to great opportunitiesand hav ing the wisdom to know the difference Buffetts secret to success is his intense focusinstead of doing more he does less He once told his personal airplane pilot Mike Flint that Flint needed to do three things to reach his goals The first was to write down his top twentyfive goals The second was to circle the top five most important ones Finally he should separate the top five goals into a separate listand put goals six through twentyfive ona nottodo list Buffett concludes by stating Everything you didnt circle just became your avoid at all cost list No matter what these things get no attention from you until youve succeeded with your top 55 We have so many things in our life that we want to do Who wouldnt want to succeed at twentyfive different things But when we chase after twentyfive things at once thats when we run the risk of becoming a jackofalltrades but a master of none Our society rewards excellence and specialization You need to excel at only a few chosen skills And this is why Buffetts nottodo list is so helpful Items six to twentyfive on your list are probably all important things that you care about But when it comes to items one to five items six to twentyfive are a distraction Spending time on secondary priorities is the reason we have twenty halffinished projects instead of five completed ones As the Pareto principle states 80 percent of your results come from 20 percent of your activities Focus on the top 20 percent of activities and deprioritize the bottom 80 percent The nottodo list concept is similar to the primary idea behind Gary Keller and Jay Papasans book The ONE Thing It debunks the theory that multitasking is the path to success Instead ask yourself What is the most important thing I can do today What is the one thing that would make everything else in my life either easier or unnecessary The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say no to almost everything Warren Buffett When you say no you are saying no only to one option When you say yes you are saying no to every other option So be careful to what and to whom you say yes This choice eventually will shape many things in your life Every day we have the opportunity to make choices and shape our future every day is the first day of the rest of our lives The third step for simplification is to reason backward Instead of trying to arrive directly at the solution begin by eliminating the options that are not correct You get an enormous advantage by narrowing your problem space You can then focus your time and atten tion on the more productive areas Lets be honest We dont know for sure what makes us successful We cant pinpoint exactly what makes us happy But we know with certainty what destroys success or happiness This realization as simple as it is is fundamental Negative knowledge what not to do is much more potent than positive knowledge what to do Rolf Dobelli To make good investing decisions you need to actively look for reasons not to buy the stock in question Invert always invert simplifying helps us make better decisions by breaking down complex problems into component parts For example I ask four inverted questions whenever I am looking at a stock These questions break the mindset of trying to find supportive bullish reasons and force me to actively seek out disconfirming evidence 1 How can I lose money versus How can I make money If you focus on preventing the downside the upside takes care of itself 2 What is this stock not worth versus What is this stock going to be worth If you can identify the floor price or a cheap price for a stock its far easier to make profitable decisions 3 What can go wrong versus What growth drivers are there Rather than focusing just on the growth catalysts think probabilistically in terms of a range of possible outcomes and contemplate the possible risks especially those that have never occurred 4 What is the growth rate being implied by the market in the current valuation of the stock versus What is my future growth rate assumption A reverse discounted cash flow fleshes out the current assumptions of the market for the stock We can then compare the markets as sumptions with our own and make a decision accordingly Good investors demonstrate the flexibility to completely change their opinions if necessitated by the facts They dont hope they will be right they keep evaluating why they might be wrong A good source for disconfirming evidence from which I have greatly ben efited is the analysis provided by vigilante investors on social media These investors tend to express bearish or skeptical commentary on almost every single company they review Another useful source for disconfirming evidence is shortseller or negative reports on the stocks Iam contemplating buying or those on which I am bullish Seth Klarman has spoken in the past about the benefit of this source of information From our experience much longoriented analysis is simplistic highly optimistic and sloppy Shortsellers by going against the longterm tide of economic growth and the shortterm swells of public opinion and margins calls are forced to be crackerjack analysts Their work product is usually topnotch and needs to be Shortsellers shouldnt be reviled or banned most should be celebrated and encouraged They are the policemen of the financial markets identifying frauds and cautioning against bubbles In effect they protect the unsophisticated from predatory schemes that regulators and enforcement agencies dont seem able to prevent1 Simplicity as a Way of Life Itis very simple to be happy but it is very difficult to be simple Rabindranath Tagore To attain knowledge add things every day to obtain wisdom remove things every day Lao Tzu Have you ever considered that there are way too many things that you need to evaluate day after day Too many news items too many questions too many possessions too many options for everything too many stocks from which to choose too many investment products that too many financial advisers want you to buy If that is the case with you what you need to bring peace to your life is minimalism Minimalism is basically an extension of simplicityyou not only take things from complex to simple but also try to get rid of any thing that is unnecessary Few things in life really matter Because few things matter we must think carefully about what really matters tous and then commit our time primarily to those things That way we will remain focused on what matters rather than chasing the new thing which probably will not really matter The goal is not to have the fewest number of things but to have the optimal number of things Practicing minimalism has brought peace and simplicity to my life I cherish it for the time it has freed up for me to focus on those aspects that are more meaningful to megiving more time to my family friends personal health and learning activities From traveling with less personal luggage eating less junk food and sugar and using fewer apps on my mobile phone to having fewer stocks in my portfolio I have embraced minimalism as a way of living I already can see the immense benefits of clarity focus and efficiency that this has brought to my life To me minimalism is about living with less stress The fact that it saves money is just an added benefit Do you hold more than fifty stocks spread across multiple brokerage accounts I urge you to simplify Have you invested in more than ten different mutual fund schemes I urge you to simplify Have you invested in numerous investment plans whose original pur pose was to provide life and health insurance I urge you to simplify Have you over time piled up loads of defunct useless stuff on your office desk or at your home I urge you to simplify Clearing the clutter from the various aspects of our lives reduces decision fatigue and sharpens our focus on what we really want to achieve There is no path to peace Peace is the path Mahatma Gandhi Mii imalism in life isnt a destination to reach it is the path to follow Practicing and adopting minimalism as a way of life is simple Its simple but not easy You cannot become a minimalist overnight But as Lao Tzu said A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step The parable of the Mexican fisherman and the American banker is one of my favorite stories and contains an important life lesson It is habitual for most of us to build incessantly and forget that the endgame should really be happiness and a fulfilling life It is equally easy to overlook all the goodness we are surrounded by today It doesnt take a lot of money to have a truly wealthy life but it does take financial independence which gives us control over our time This is the important topic that we will address in the next chapter CHAPTER 9 ACHIEVING FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it Upton Sinclair Whose bread I eat his song I sing Charlie Munger financial independence Once you achieve this state it changes everything It enables you to look at reality in a truly unbiased manner Aim to achieve financial independence at the earliest time That is when you will start seeing the world as it really is Itis difficult to think and act long term unless you are financially independent Financial independence doesnt mean you dont work just that you dont need to It removes the internal distraction of unpredictable employment T ruth is hard to assimilate when it is opposed by interest You cannot really understand how the world truly works unless you have The goal of financial independence is to stop depending on others bosses clients a schedule a paycheck True wealth is measured in terms of personal liberty and freedom not monetary currency Money alone does not signify independence Control over time does The only definition of success is to be able to spend your life in your own way Is there a way for us to achieve financial independence As it turns out there is indeed a simple way to do it Its simple but not easy It requires a lot of hard work sacrifice discipline and patience When I was young I read The Richest Man in Babylon which said to underspend your income and invest the difference emphasis added Lo and behold I did this and it worked Charlie Munger The first step to financial independence is to live within your means In Charles Dickenss classic David Copperfield he wrote annual income twenty pounds annual expenditure nineteen six result happiness Annual income twenty pounds annual expenditure twenty pound ought and six result misery This was written in 1849 and it is just as true todayand will remain so forever Underspend your income to the maximum extent possible Avoid taking on any debt for discretionary consumption Cook at home Buy clothes only on sale Learn to cherish frugality Read The Way to Wealth by Benjamin Franklin The Richest Man in Babylon by George Clason The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas Stanley and William Danko and Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki Always pay yourself first Spend on yourself only what is left after you have made an investment Never depend on a single source of income make an invest ment in yourself and learn a new skill to create a second source Avoid getrichquick schemes Invest wisely by learning from the great investors When you finally achieve financial independence you will truly appreciate the value of money because of all the sacrifices you made in the past Building wealth over time has less to do with your income levels or investment returns and more to do with your savings discipline As Peter Lynch says In the long run its not just how much money you make that will determine your future prosperity Its how much of that money you put to work by saving it and investing it2 Wealth is the accumulated savings over time that is left over after you are done spending from your income Because you can build wealth without a high income but have no chance without any savings it is pretty obvious which one deserves a higher priority To me money represents freedom and independence and not a means to engage in conspicuous consumption Spending beyond a modest level of materialism is mostly a reflection of ones ego One of the most effective ways to increase your savings is to raise not your income but your humility A friend once asked me Why make all that money so you can save it to which I replied Why spend all that money so you need to earn it again If money were the true measure of wealth every rich person would be happy But we know this is not true Money cant buya loving family good health integrity ethics humility kindness respect character or a clear conscience The most important things in life are priceless and in my view those are the true measures of wealth Lasting happiness is achieved by living a meaningful lifea life filled with passion and freedom in which we grow as individuals and contribute beyond ourselves Growth and contribution are the bedrocks of happiness Not stuff In his book The Geometry of Wealth Brian Portnoy describes wealth as funded contentment that is the ability to underwrite a meaningful life in which purpose and practice are thoughtfully calibrated Wealth derives its real meaning from a personal definition of our inner values Savings is a hedge against lifes inevitable setbacks Savings confers on us options and flexibility the ability to wait and the very possibility to participate in the rare superlative opportunities that may present themselves during ones lifetime But the most important reason for saving is personal freedom and control over time This allows us to devote more attention to the meaningful aspects of our lives such as relationships creative pursuits health and philanthropy Personal freedom allows us sufficient time to think Making good decisions requires quiet time alone in our heads to think through a problem from multiple points of view Uninterrupted personal time is lifes most valuable limited resource Several notable creators including Bill Gates and Mark Zucker berg regularly take think weeks to invigorate their thinking and to allow their minds to wander They often advocate the value of taking time off specifically to relax and clear ones head Taking a whole week off to focus on our thinking process may sound like a farfetched sce nario but this is possible once we achieve financial independence Only then can we engage in frequent pauses selfreflection anda calm distillation of thoughts patterns and wisdom This is essential As investors we tend to spend too much time reading about what others think or are investing in As a result we spend too little time on introspection Quiet freedom is exotic Freedom is like income that cannot be taxed Value investors who achieve financial independence in their thirties or forties spend the rest of their lives doing something that they love learning more about the world Benjamin Franklin frequently wrote about the virtues of frugality and a strong work ethic He was aware that lost time is never found again and he pursued financial independence to make sure he gained back as much time as possible He testified that more than 90 percent of his writing was the gleanings I had made of the sense of all ages and nations Franklin studied the past so that he could gain more freedom in his present By building a print shop into a successful business Franklin was able to retire at the age of fortytwo What is truly inspirational is his attitude toward building wealth Here was a man who accumulated a vast fortune by the age of fortytwo but he didnt concern him self with accumulating money for moneys sake In a letter to his mother Franklin wrote I would rather have it said He lived usefully than He died rich Franklin lived usefully and put himself into the position to give away his fortune throughout his life The Way to Wealth published in 1758 is a summary of Benjamin Franklins advice from Poor Richards Almanack published from 1733 to 1758 Its a compilation of proverbs woven into a systematic ethical code advocating industry and frugality as a way to wealth thereby securing personal virtue Franklins advice is just as relevant today as it was more than 260 years ago He advocated work ethic in dustry and enterprise in ones daily affairs But dost thou love life then do not squander time for thats the stuff life is made of Franklin believed everyone should contribute to society and that we should enthusiastically approach each day as we make those daily contributions In his eyes life embodied a community of people working together for the common good It is why he believed in We the people and advocated that if we are industrious we shall never starve for at the working mans house hunger looks in but dares not enter The eldest Founding Father of the United States was also a firm advocate of the virtues of frugality If you would be wealthythink of saving as well as of getting the Indies have not made Spain rich because her outgoes are greater than her incomes For Franklin frugality and a strong work ethic were necessary character traits for building wealth Benjamin Franklin was able to make the contribution he did because he had financial freedom Charlie Munger During his interactions with the audience at the University of Michigans Ross School of Business in 2017 Charlie Munger shared an overview of his early years and how he personally achieved financial independence before really getting involved in business with War ren Buffett In a blog post Jonathan Ping discussed how Munger emulated his role model Benjamin Franklins virtues Munger was not born into exceptional wealth He wanted to go to Stanford as an undergraduate but his father encouraged him to go to the University of Michigan because it was still an excellent school but was more affordable Munger dropped out after only one year in 1943 to serve in the US Army Air Corps Military service then law school After World War II Munger took college courses on the GI Bill and eventually went to Harvard Law School He got accepted even though he had never earned an undergraduate degree Successful law career Munger successfully practiced real estate law until he achieved about 300000 in assets This equaled ten years of living expenses for his family at the time he had a wife and multiple kids At this point he started doing real estate de velopment at the same time When this took off he stopped practicing law Successful real estate development When Munger achieved about 3 million to 4 million in assets he wound down his real estate development firm He was now financially independent Decision to become a fulltime capitalist This last stage is what led him to his current status as a billionaire philanthropist Along with his work with Buffett at Berkshire Munger was the chairman of Wesco Financial which also grew to be a conglom erate of various wholly owned businesses along with a carefully run stock portfolio Wesco Financial eventually became a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Using Mungers life as a blueprint we can observe a pathway toward achieving financial independence Work hard get an education develop a valuable skill Munger didnt start Facebook from his dorm room or trade cryptos in high school He served in the military earned a law degree and went to work every day for years At this point work means exchang ing your time for money but hopefully at a good hourly rate Use that work career and save up ten times your living expenses Munger dutifully saved as much as he could from his salary while supporting his family and kids You probably wont need ten times that amount if you dont have a family to support but you should still plan for the future and target this level of savings To accelerate wealth accumulation you can take some risk and start some sort of business You need something that scales something that is not paid by the hour or the month Munger pursued real estate development If you look at people who got wealthy quickly nearly all of them owned businesses of some type Still there are no guarantees You need to believe that a rea sonably calculated strategy based on sound and sensible principles will work As Steve Jobs once remarked You cant connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards So you have to trust that the dots will somehow con nect in your future You have to trust in somethingyour gut destiny life karma whatever In short you need to have faith At some point your investments will earn enough passive income to support your living expenses This is when you achieve financial independence It doesnt matter what you do during the day because you earn enough money while you are sleeping Many people choose to continue along one of the paths above 1 employeebased career 2 active business management or 3 actively managing their investments Mungers life teaches us that just showing up every day and chipping away at it one small block at a time eventually yields great dividends Dogged incremental progress over a long period of time is the key to success and this in essence is what compounding is all about Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up Discharge your duties faithfully and well Step by step you get ahead but not necessarily in fast spurts But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts Slug it out one inch ata time day by day At the end of the dayif you live long enoughmost people get what they deserve Charlie Munger We can learn a lot by observing Mungers actions He was not a huge risktaker He grew his wealth gradually and never exposed his family to possible ruin He worked hard for a long time and became extraordinarily rich and famous only later in his life He primarily wanted to be independent and just overshot The Journey to the First Million Making the first million dollars is often considered to be the hardest because you dont know how to do it and because you dont know if you can do it Once you have made 1 million you know you can do it and you even know how to do it This is why a selfmade millionaire who loses all his money because of an unfortunate event can become a millionaire again Many people who are considered successful dont accumulate a million dollars and it is not because they dont earn enough to do so It is simply because they lack discipline Society glamorizes a consumptionladen lifestyle and most people follow this path spending on nonnecessities that drain earnings leaving little in the form of savings The journey to the first million starts with the very first dollar in savings and then another and so on It is not the first million dollars that is the hardest it is the first dollar The most difficult part is get ting started During my savings and wealth accumulation phase I was willing to work as hard as I could for as many hours as I possibly could to reach this important milestone of the first million I was trying to save every single dime that I could during this endeavor I never lost sight of Benjamin Franklins teaching Beware of little expenses a small leak will sink a great ship More important I was constantly investing in myself I was ferociously intense about learning as much as I possibly could every day Once a certain level of critical mass in portfolio value was achieved compound interest took over and proceeded to amaze me with its magic Today even after achieving financial freedom I continue to work in a job because I want to not because I need to I do it because I just love the work I get to do every day and I feel a sense of joy in doing what I love and loving what I do Today I get a deep sense of fulfill ment when I look back at the memories of my challenging times and sacrifices in the past which eventually helped me earn my first mil lion dollars of profits from investing Benjamin Franklin laid down the way to wealth for all of us when he said The way to wealth is as plain as the way to market It depends chiefly on two words industry and frugality that is waste neither time nor money but make the best use of both Without in dustry and frugality nothing will do with them everything Resist Stepping on the Hedonic Treadmill I saw that it was the artificial needs of life that made me a slave the real needs of life were few William James Dawson Great wealth often inflicts a curse on its owners Its called the hedonic treadmill and its function is to continually move the goalpost of your financial dreams completely extinguishing the joy you thought you would get from having more money once you attain it People are constantly running on the hedonic treadmill as they make more money their expectations and desires rise in tandem which results inno permanent gain in happiness Economist Richard Easterlin measured the life satisfaction of Americans in 1946 and 1970 and came to the conclusion that ma terial progress was not reflected in increased life satisfaction This revelation was termed the Easterlin paradox Once ones basic needs have been met incremental financial gain contributes nothing to happiness This is because in our minds wealth is always relative not absolute Aresearch study posed the following question Which new employee would be happier the person making 36000 in a firm where the starting salary is 40000 or the one making 34000 where the average is 30000 Almost 80 percent said 34000 would make them happier3 We want what we want until we want some more A process called hedonic adaptation determines that we quickly become accus tomed to most things in our lives As a result experienced happiness is often fleeting We may have x and think this should be sufficient to live a happy life but when we see others who have 2x we think that would make us happier And then we raise the bar to 3x 4x or 10x This is a sure path to lifelong misery even if one eventually becomes monetarily rich Very often as Dave Ramsey points out We buy things we dont need with money we dont have to impress people we dont know We want to look good over doing good Consequently we make choices based on optics defensibility and so on This typically results from not having a strong sense of self and from seeking external validation As Benjamin Franklin said It is the eyes of others and not our own eyes that ruin us If all the world were blind except myself I should not care for fine clothes or furniture Acquired material objects do not necessarily improve your life Desiring them is indicative of some social emotional or psychological gap that you need to work on Dont confuse pleasure with happiness Pleasure is shortlived and modern corporations have convinced most people that the only way to be happy is through the pursuit of pleasure The longer you stay on the hedonic treadmill the more it will break you down emotionally so get off of it quickly The book Classics An Investors Anthology features an essay about P T Barnum that quotes Barnum on the tendency for individuals to step on the hedonic treadmill Thousands of men are kept poor and tens of thousands are made so after they have acquired quite sufficient to support them well through life in consequence of laying their plans of living too expensive a platform Prosperity is a more severe ordeal than adversity especially sudden prosperity Easy come easy go is an old and true proverb Pride when permitted full sway is the great undying cankerworm which gnaws the very vitals of a mans worldly posses sions let them be small or great hundreds or millions Many persons as they begin to prosper immediately commence expending for luxuries until in a short time their expenses swallow up their income and they become ruined in their ridiculous attempts to keep up ap pearances and make a sensation emphasis added Seneca also shared his thoughts on the futile attempts to maximize ones monetary worth rather than ones happiness Epicurus says Contented poverty is an honorable estate Indeed if it be contented it is not poverty at all It is not the man who has 00 little but the man who craves more that is poor emphasis added What does it matter how much a man has laid up in his safe or in his warehouse how large are his flocks and how fat his dividends if he covets his neighbors property and reckons not his past gains but his hopes of gains to come Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth It is first to have what is necessary and second to have what is enough Morgan Housel recommends a solution to the hedonic treadmill problem The solution particularly after basic needs are met is actively seeking contentment with what you have That doesnt mean you stop saving stop putting in effort stop sacrificing It means you come to terms with the idea that the outcome isnt a fountain of happiness So if youre going to grind you better damn well enjoy the process Housels words remind me of one of the most profound thoughts I have ever encountered on the subject from George Lorimer Its good to have money and the things that money can buy but its good too to check up once in a while and make sure that you havent lost the things that money cant buy emphasis added Never measure life by your possessions Measure it by the hearts you touched the smiles you created and the love you shared Love people and use things because the opposite never works Love is caring without an agenda Love isnt something we fall into its someone we become CHAPTER 10 LIVING LIFE ACCORDING TO THE INNER SCORECARD To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment Ralph Waldo Emerson The path to true success is through authenticity Guy Spier ccording to Warren Buffett there are two kinds of people in life those who care what people think of them and those who care how good they really are Buffett always remains true to himself and never compromises on his values He has never cared about luxurious posses sions and he still lives in the modest house he bought for 31500 in 1958 As an investor Buffett thinks entirely for himself and invests only according to his personal investment philosophy During 1999 in the midst of the Internet bubble Buffett was being humiliated by some of the leading financial commentators of the time and Berkshires stock price was getting hammered But Buffett always kept in mind what he had been taught by his fatherthat the only scorecard that counts is your inner scorecard In December 1999 Barrons put Buffett on its cover with the headline Warren Whats Wrong The accompanying article said Berkshire had stumbled badly Buffett was facing a kind of negative press like nothing he had ever experienced Many longtime value investors who followed Buffetts style had either shut down their firms or given in and bought technology stocks Buffett did not What he called his inner scorecarda toughness about personal decisions that had infused him for as long as anyone could rememberkept him from wavering and he steadfastly adhered to his longheld principles He never forgot his teacher Ben Grahams words In the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine Dont live a life based on approval from others Be authenticact in accordance with who you are and what you believe in or one day your mask will fall off If Buffett was living by the standards others followed he would not have been able to maintain the firm inde pendence of mind that has helped him avoid many financial bubbles and the subsequent personal misery It is a significant lesson for all investors A contrarian isnt one who always takes the opposite path just for the sake of it That is simply a conformist of a different sort A true contrarian is one who reasons independently from the ground up based on factual data and resists pressure to conform If in your heart you know who you really are and that the choice you made was absolutely right then the criticism of others should be considered and analyzed to see whether it truly has any merit but it should not be given permission to belittle what you are trying to achieve Let your life be guided by internal principles not external validation Selfrespect beats social approval Every time We are not perfect nor should we pretend to be but we always should endeavor to be the best version of ourselves Buffetts operating principles during the Buffett Partnership years provide many lessons for fund managersand all those who should always occupy the high ground in the interest of their clients The Buffett Partnership Years In 1956 when he was just twentyfive years old Warren Buffett formed Buffett Partnership Ltd with 105100 in capital and seven lim ited partners his mother sister aunt fatherinlaw brotherinlaw college roommate and lawyer He charged no management fee took 25 percent of any gains beyond a cumulative 6 percent and agreed to personally absorb a percentage of any losses You will rarely find such an equitable fee structure in the investment management industry today By 1969 100000 invested in the Buffett Partnership in 1957 would have become 1719481 If you had invested the same amount in the Dow it would have grown to only 252467 For more than a decade Buffett achieved a compound annual return of 245 percent net of fees 295 percent before fees The compound annual retum of the Dow over the same time with dividends was 74 percent And yet despite all this success Warren Buffett announced to his limited partners in May 1969 that he would be closing down the Buffett Partnership Buffett was young he was having extraordinary success and he was having to actually turn away investors Why did Warren Buffett decide to close down his investment partnership in 1969 Because he possessed certain virtues Honesty Sincerity Integrity Authenticity In January 1967 after a decade of incredible results Buffett warned his limited partners to temper their expectations The results of the first ten years have absolutely no chance of being duplicated or even remotely approximated during the next decade2 In October 1967 Buffett explained to his investors why he didnt think he would be able to achieve the same results Such statistical bargains have tended to disappear over the years When the game is no longer being played your way it is only human to say the new approach is all wrong bound to lead to trouble etc I have been scornful of such behavior by others in the past I have also seen the penalties incurred by those who evalu ate conditions as they werenot as they are Essentially am out of step with present conditions On one point however Iam clear Iwill not abandon a previous approach whose logic I understand although I find it difficult to apply even though it may mean foregoing sic large and apparently easy profits to embrace an approach which I dont fully understand have not practiced successfully and which possibly could lead to substantial permanent loss of capital emphasis added 3 In January 1969 even after the Buffett Partnerships best year ever Warren Buffett continued to stand his ground At the beginning of 1968 I felt prospects for BPL performance looked poorer than at any time in our history We established a new markat plus 588 percent versus an overall plus 77 percent for the Dow including dividends which would have been received through the ownership of the Average throughout the year This result should be treated as a freak like picking up thirteen spades in a bridge game In May 1969 Buffett said he was running out of good investment ideas He said he could take some chances and gamble with his investors money so that he could go out a hero but he refused to do so Finally in October 1969 Warren Buffett closed the Buffett Partnership Inhis final letter Buffett wrote his partners a tenpage explanation of why he recommended taxfree municipal bondseven offer ing to sit down with each of them individually to explain the rationale as well as to make the actual purchases for them For those who wished to continue to invest in stocks he said I feel it would be totally unfair for me to assume a passive position and deliver you to the most persuasive salesman who happened to contact you early in 1970 Buffett recommended his clients invest with his Columbia classmate Bill Ruane not because he was the best investor Buffett knew other than himself but because Buffett viewed him as a person with high integrity and moral character Remember most of Buffetts lim ited partners were his relatives and close friends According to Buffett Ruane was the money manager within my knowledge who ranks the highest when combining the factors of integrity ability and continued availability to all partners Bill Ruane turned out to be a legendary investor in his own right and his Sequoia Fund returned 2896 percent over the next decade versus 1051 percent for the SP 500 Later on Ruane would be included as one of the superinvestors in Buffetts speech titled The Super investors of GrahamandDoddsville delivered in May 1984 at Columbia Business School Throughout his early partnership years Buffett embodied what Peter Kaufmann referred to during the 2018 Daily Journal Corpora tion meeting as the five aces of money management figure 101 Fave Quaritres OF INVESTMENT ADVISORS LF ever you find one money manager investment advisor with all five qualities pet morey there immediatety and put as much as youre allowed 46 put with them Petey Kaufman Figure 101 Five Qualities of Investment Advisors by Peter Kaufman Source Charlie Munger on Bitcoins Banking Al and Life Safal Niveshak blog February 17 2018 httpswwwsafalniveshakcom charliemungerbitcoinsbanking_life Fund managers who in essence are operating in a fiduciary role for their clients should view themselves first and foremost as risk managers As such they should follow the key principles of prudent insurance underwriting outlined in Buffetts 2001 shareholder letter They accept only those risks that they are able to properly evaluate staying within their circle of competence and that after they have evaluated all relevant factors including remote loss scenarios carry the expectancy of profit They limit the business they accept in a manner that guarantees they will suffer no aggregation of losses from a single event or from related events that will threaten their solvency They ceaselessly search for possible correlation among seeminglyunrelated risks Charlie Munger has always admired his protégé Li Lu for his work ethic and high integrity as a trusted steward of capital To under stand why one needs only to listen to what Lu told the students at the Guanghua School of Management in China in October 2015 Establish an awareness of fiduciary duty What are fiduciary duties You must treat every dollar of client money as though it were the fruit of your own parents labor saved up piece by piece over a lifetime of diligence and thrift Even if its not much it took years of struggle and sacrifice to accumulate If you can understand the responsibility this entails then you can start to understand the meaning of fiduciary duty Ithink the concept of fiduciary duty is innate people either have it or they dont Never forget your moral responsibility to the individuals and families who entrust you with their lifes hardearned savings When the permabull inside you urges you to engage in risky strategies or to eke out the final few points of a rampant bull market where there could be a quick 20 percent upside along with a potential 50 percent downside think about the man or lady who worked on the checkout line at Walmart for years to put something aside for his or her retirement How would it affect their retirement dreams and life aspirations if you lost half their money How would they feel if they knew what you were doing How would you feel if you were fully aware about what you were doing An outer scorecard which many people have asks What will people think of me Will they judge me by the way I dress or the way Look or the car I drive But the inner scorecard which is much more important asks Am I doing the right things Am I treating people correctly Is this working for me as an individual Its what Rose Blumkin the Nebraska Furniture Mart founder stood for and she lived her life under one single motto Sell cheap and tell the truth The inner scorecard is the inner set of criteria and standards by which a person judges her or himself In contrast the outer score card is an external comparative picture of selfworth predicated on the judgments of others There is a clear parallel here between the inner scorecard and the concept of intrinsic value and between the outer scorecard and the concept of market value Benjamin Graham had talked about this very parallel in The Intelligent Investor Have the courage of your knowledge and experience If you have formed a conclusion from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound act on iteven though others may hesitate or differ You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you You are right because your data and reasoning are right emphasis added Focusing on his inner scorecard and living life in a principled manner has worked for Buffett He has always believed in the dictum Honesty is the best policy Buffett has always taken the high road and it has paid off very well For instance he could have saved billions by moving his reinsurance operations tax domicile to a taxadvantaged jurisdiction as many of his competitors did but he didnt His in dependent spirit infuses every aspect of his life This includes his diet which mostly revolves around burgers and Cherry Coke In the late 1980s when the US savings and loan SL companies were using accounting tricks to create capital out of thin air they were heading toward a crisis of widespread bankruptcies that would destroy depositor savings require a taxpayer bailout and result ina furious public backlash Munger who was chairman and CEO of Berkshires SL operation Wesco Financial foresaw that Wescos better behavior wouldnt prevent it from being tainted by association He not only cut back Wescos lending but also took an extreme stand to distance Wesco from the other SLs by resigning from the US League of Savings Institutions in a letter in which he likened the trade as sociation to metastasizing cancer cells and called its lobbying practices flawed indeed disgraceful2 It was a step that only a person who was willing to be detested by an entire industry could take The move paid off when the SL crisis erupted and Wescos reputation was left completely unscathed It was Mungers action of high integrity during the 1980s SL crisis that set Berkshire on its path to being held up as the moral exemplar of corporate America What Buffett Munger and a lot of other people who have been successful in life true success not measured by money have in common is that they strive for a happy and fulfilling life Not just getting rich Not just trying to get famous But living a truly satisfying existence with full integrity and helping others around them achieve the same Bernie Madoff achieved great admiration and wealth over the duration of his Ponzi scheme but was he happy He made it clear after he had been caught that he wasnt Here was a guy who had all the admiration in the world an external scorecard showing an At But what happened when he lost it all He heaved a sigh of relief According to New York magazine For Bernie Madoff living a lie had once been a fulltime job which carried with it a constant nagging anxiety It was a nightmare for me he told investigators using the word over and over as if he were the real victim I wish they caught me six years ago eight years ago he said in a littlenoticed interview with them Shane Parrish writes The little mental trick is to remember that success money fame and beauty all the things we pursue are merely the numerator If the denominatorshame regret unhappiness lonelinessis too large our Life Satisfaction Score ends up being tiny worthless Even if we have all that good stuffIts so simple This is why you see people that should be happy who are not Big denominators destroy selfworth2 Adam Smith addressed this issue more than two centuries ago in his book The Theory of Moral Sentiments He said that even though we desire to be loved by others at the end of the day we experience happiness only when we are successful according to our inner score card We derive true joy from our achievements only when we feel we truly deserve it We cant just receive praise We must be praisewor thy We cant just be loved We must be loveable To get what you want deserve what you want Trust respect and admiration need to be earned As Munger says Its such a simple idea Its the golden rule so to speak You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end There is no ethos in my opinion that is better for any lawyer or any other person to have By and large the people who have this ethos win in life and they dont win just money not just honors They win the respect the deserved trust of the people they deal with and there is huge pleasure in life to be obtained from getting deserved trust emphasis added2 The idea of living ones life according to the inner scorecard is closely linked to the concept of the Kantian fairness tendency dis cussed by Munger in his essay The Psychology of Human Misjudgment Kant was famous for his categorical imperative a sort of a golden rule that required humans to follow those behavior patterns that if followed by all others would make the surrounding human system work best for everybody Took at this as the law of the higher good of treading the high moral ground of taking the road less traveled of being the better people Buffett and Munger have exemplified this behavior in their daily dealings for the past many decades and their goodwill has com pounded in an exponential manner over the years We must look at individual situations from our civilizations point of view rather than the viewpoint of any single individual including ourselves If we behave in a way that encourages lies and deceit or if we tolerate such systems we will ruin our civilization If we dont punish the concerned individual even if that person is us the idea that it is okay to do minor unethical deeds once in a while will spread because of incentive effects and social proof Everyone is doing it so its okay It is our duty to act as moral exemplars and to in spire others to do the same When I was an officer in the military we had a rule called Conduct Unbecoming an Officer It was not specific but it said there were certain ways to behave as an example for others If you rise high in a corporation or elsewhere in life you have a duty to be an exem plaryou have a duty to take less than you deserve to set an example emphasis added Charlie Munger Ultimately you want to be at peace with yourself able to face the mirror every day As the saying goes There is no pillow so soft as a clear conscience We should not pay mere lip service to our role models in life we should embody them in words action and spirit Over the course of our lives we will face difficult situations in which being truthful is painful up front Following the path of righteousness during such times delivers enormous rewards in the long run Our goodwill compounds exponentially over time when we live life according to the inner scorecard Again Munger shares some great thoughts I think the best single way to teach ethics is by example And that means if you take in people who demonstrate in all their daily conduct a good ethical framework I think that has enormous influence on the people who watch it But if your ethics slip and peo ple are rewarded nevertheless then it cascades downward Ethics are terribly important but best taught indirectly by example If you just learn a few rules by having ethics taught in school so they can pass the test it doesnt do much But if you see people you re spect behaving in a certain way especially under stress that has a real impact emphasis added1 The principle of reciprocity states Treat others the way you would like them to treat you and Do unto others as you would have done unto you Character is how you treat others when you have the upper hand and no one is watching Over the long term what goes around comes around Karma is a like a big snowball So acting in an ethical manner with everyone is the most honorable way to lead ones life Our worlds moral fabric would be completely transformed if all of humanity imbibed as a way of life Senecas golden words Cherish some man of high character and keep him ever before your eyes living as if he were watching you and ordering all your actions as if he beheld them6 CHAPTER 11 THE KEY TO SUCCESS IN LIFE IS DELAYED GRATIFICATION Someones sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago Warren Buffett If youre glued together and honorable and get up every morning and keep learning every day and youre willing to go in for a lot of de ferred gratification all your life youre going to succeed Charlie Munger People who arbitrage time will almost always outperform The first order thought of instant gratification is a crowded path ensuring mediocre results at best Delayed gratification which requires second order thinking is less crowded and more likely to get results Shane Parrish nthe 1960s Walter Mischel an American psychologist specializing in personality theory and social psychology conducted a famous experiment at Stanford Universitys nursery school In the experiment now widely known as the Stanford marshmallow experiment four and fiveyearolds were presented with a difficult choice They could eat one treata marshmallowimmediately or they could wait fifteen minutes more and be rewarded with two marshmallows Over the next forty years the children were included in followup studies It was found that the children who were willing to delay gratification and waited to receive the second marshmallow ended up having higher SAT scores lower levels of substance abuse lower likelihood of obesity better responses to stress better social skills as reported by their parents and better scores on a range of other life measures In other words the experiment demonstrated the virtues of delayed gratificationdoing what is hard now rather than doing what is easy Over time this builds up the muscle of discipline strengthens ones skills and capabilities and compounds into a much greater level of success and satisfaction than taking the easier path Charlie Munger has always been a big proponent of delayed gratification He has emphasized the importance of patience and being prepared to act at scale when great opportunities arise These are rare and fleeting so we need to be patient prepared and decisive to seize them Munger has shared an inspiring example He had been reading Barrons magazine for more than fifty years and found only one actionable idea in it It was a cheaply valued auto parts company the name is widely speculated to be Tenneco which he bought at 1 per share and sold a few years later at 15 per share earning him 80 million in profits Munger then gave Li Lu the 80 million and Lu turned this into 400 million Through just two investments Munger turned a few million into 400 million This example illustrates the significance of extreme patience deferred gratification and displaying strong decisiveness at the right moment It is why Munger has said It takes character to sit there with all that cash and do nothing I didnt get to where I am by going after mediocre opportunities empha sis added The only way to win is to work work work work and hope to have a few insights Charlie Munger How much insight does one need in a lifetime to be a successful investor Not much as Warren Buffett explains Icould improve your ultimate financial welfare by giving you a ticket with only twenty slots in it so that you had twenty punches representing all the investments that you got to make ina lifetime And once youd punched through the card you couldnt make any more investments at all Under those rules youd really think carefully about what you did and youd be forced to load up on what youd really thought about So youd do so much better Munger repeatedly brought up the topic of deferred gratification during the 2017 Daily Journal Corporation meeting He talked about how most investors are looking for a quick buck but the best investors defer their gratification for much larger gains that come later in the distant future Longterm investors look for management teams that are willing to defer gratification These teams are focused on building a durable economic franchise They are focused on the longevity of the business They are willing to forgo nearterm earnings to increase longterm value Lets look at the compound interest formula and view it in a way that helps us think about building longterm value n a p1 a 191 100 where a accumulated future value p principal or present value r rate of return in percentage terms and n number of compounding periods Alltoo often management teams focus on the r variable in this equation They seek instant gratification with high profit margins and high growth in reported earnings per share EPS in the near term as opposed to initiatives that would lead to a much more valuable business many years down the line This causes many management teams to pass on investments that would create longterm value but would cause accounting numbers to look bad in the short term Pressure from analysts can inadvertently incentivize companies to make as much money as possible off their present customers to report good quarterly numbers instead of offering a fair price that creates enduring goodwill and a longterm winwin relationship for all stakeholders The businesses that buy commodities and sell brands and have strong pricing power typically depicted by high gross margins should always remember that possessing pricing power is like hav ing access to a large amount of credit You may have it in abundance but you must use it sparingly Having pricing power doesnt mean you exercise it right away Consumer surplus is a great strategy especially for subscriptionbased business models in which management should primarily focus on habit formation and making renewals a nobrainer Most businesses fail to appreciate this delicate tradeoff between high shortterm profitability and the longevity accorded to the business through disciplined pricing and offering great customer value The few businesses that do understand this tradeoff always display pain today gain tomorrow thinking in their daily decisions Lets look at two contrasting examples On one hand we have Valeant Pharmaceuticals which buys lifesaving drugs for rare diseases from innovative companies but then resorts to predatory pricing The financial metrics might appear attractive but a parasitic relationship of extracting value from customers rather than adding value to them usually ends up destroying shareholder value at some point in the future On the other we have companies like Amazon led by Jeff Bezos who says Weve done price elasticity studies and the answer is always that we should raise prices We dont do that because we believeand we have to take this as an article of faiththat by keeping our prices very very low we earn trust with customers over time and that that actually does maximize free cash flow over the long term emphasis added2 Some companies are willing to look past maximizing shortrun focused r and instead focus on maximizing longterm focused n to create maximum longterm stakeholder value and happy customers Amazon Nebraska Furniture Mart Costco and GEICO are prominent examples As they have grown larger over time and have achieved economies of scale they have continued to share those benefits with customers in the form of lower prices and to provide more value for their customers This not only makes for delighted customers who then spend more money with those companies but also makes those businesses harder to compete with over time because they have the rare ability to defer gratification in lieu of longterm benefits Consider the following quotes from Bezos that reflect the culture of long term thinking at Amazon A dreamy business offering has at least four characteristics Customers love it it can grow to very large size it has strong returns on capital and its durable in timewith the potential to endure for decades emphasis added When you find one of these dont just swipe right get married Percentage margins are not one of the things we are seeking to optimize Its the absolute dollar free cash flow per share that you want to maximize and if you can do that by lowering margins we would do that emphasis added So if you could take the free cash flow thats something that investors can spend Investors cant spend percentage margins Selling at low prices creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long term to a much larger dollar amount of free cash flow and thereby to a much more valuable Amazoncom emphasis added When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP generally accepted accounting principles account ing and maximizing the present value of future cash flows emphasis added well take the cash flows Some of the best insight on the virtues of delayed gratification in creating longterm intrinsic value comes from studying Buffetts comments on GEICOs customer acquisition costs over the years In 1999 we will again increase our marketing budget spending at least 190 million In fact there is no limit to what Berkshire is willing to invest in GEICOs newbusiness activity as long as we can concurrently build the infrastructure the company needs to properly serve its policyholders Because of the firstyear costs companies that are concerned about quarterly or annual earnings would shy from similar investments no matter how intelligent these might be in terms of building longterm value Our calculus is different We simply mea sure whether we are creating more than a dollar of value per dollar spentand if that calculation is favorable the more dollars we spend the happier Iam emphasis added At GEICO for example we enthusiastically spent 900 million last year on advertising to obtain policyholders who deliver us no immediate profits If we could spend twice that amount productively we would happily do so though shortterm results would be fur ther penalized emphasis added 2 Buffett views these expenditures which put pressure on reported earnings in the short term as longterm value creating invest ments In ownerrelated business principle number 6 of the Berkshire owners manual he states Accounting consequences do not influ ence our operating or capitalallocation decisions When acquisition costs are similar we much prefer to purchase 2 of earnings that is not reportable by us under standard accounting principles than to purchase 1 of earnings that is reportable2 Noted value investor Thomas Russo has often talked about companies that have the capacity to suffer or the capacity to reinvest to build longterm competitive advantage at the cost of depressed shortterm reported earnings Usually these companies have an owner ship structure that keeps activist investors at bay Usually some individual or entity has enough control to adhere to a strategic path and build a longterm economic franchise without bothering too much about shortterm profitability Growing a business in a new market requires high upfront costs These higher costs depress current earnings which negatively affect the stock price in a shortsighted market Most early upfront costs beyond production and distribution are put toward converting people into lifetime consumers as their income grows Significant advertising and promotion is needed initially to maintain early market presence before a company sees growth in mar ket share or profits That process takes time and requires a lot of patience which most management teams do not have That nagging itch from shareholders employees with stock options and the managements net worth measurements cause companies to make a little com promise here hold back on some needed investment there to feed the earnings machine pacify Wall Street and prop up the stock price Just scratch that itch a little bit It will feel so much better But once scratched does the itch ever go away This is doubtful Companies end up getting entangled in the endless game of managing analyst expectations By bowing to these expectations they become complicit and then it is hard to exit They begin playing the earnings management game to avoid the shortterm hit thats likely to follow Or they think it could threaten their tenuous hold on strategic control Or they fear they may lose their jobs if Wall Street declares that the earnings are in a secular decline Management teams that are influenced easily by shorttermoriented shareholders like an activist tend to focus on activities that drive shortterm results at the expense of longterm success In the most recent edition of the book Valuation Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies the authors write Weve found empirically that longterm revenue growthparticularly organic revenue growthis the most important driver of shareholder returns for companies with high returns on capital Weve also found that investments in research and development RD correlate powerfully with positive longterm total returns to shareholders At the same time the book also notes that in a survey of 400 chief financial offi cers two Duke University professors found that fully 80 percent of the CFOs said they would reduce discretionary spending on potentially valuecreating activities such as marketing and RD in order to meet their shortterm earnings targets Most managers are not willing to suffer upfront pain So they focus on shortterm results which contributes to underinvestment in brand building RD and other longterm growth initiatives which in tum eventually leads to longterm pain They cut current costs to prop up current earnings rather than spend more now to gain much more later Consequently they hurt their chances of longterm success It is important to align your personal values with that of your investment Buffett and Munger are masters of practicing delayed gratification and unless you as a partner in Berkshire Hathaway are equally willing to delay gratification you will end up as a frustrated shareholder Buffett is happy to forgo current profits for GEICO to acquire additional policyholders but he is also willing to increase expenditures and their concurrent charges against earnings if warranted because he always focuses on total lifetime value of every customer When a business has a high ratio of lifetime value to customer acquisition costs its rational to invest as much as possible in acquiring new customers That is how Buffett thinks about advertising dollars spent on profitable customer acquisition by GEICO in net present value terms In the insurance business Berkshire Hathaway not only will happily forgo business and market share in the absence of profitable underwriting opportunities but also in specific instances will incur underwriting losses that hit the bottom line in the current year In exchange they acquire float that will produce income for many years in the future What could be worse All of the expenses are currently recognized and all of the income will be recognized only in future years as the float produces investment earnings This is delayed gratifi cation in the extreme The question in all of these cases is this Are you as a shareholder willing to give the same commitment to delayed gratification that Buffett and Munger practice If not you may want to revisit your participation in this security and in other securities with similar long termminded management teams Keep in mind that only by resisting the marshmallows today will you receive the whole box of Sees truffles tomorrow Investors generally overlook businesses that are doing things that will create significant incremental earnings one to two years from now because they dont want to wait that far out Investors often shun businesses that are investing for the future and currently are suffering from low initial margins in those new initiatives because capacity gets utilized only over time because the earnings growth is backended Even if they execute well they will see little reported earnings growth for the next four to eight quarters and may even see a decline resulting from incremental depreciation and poor initial margins because of low capacity utilization Even if they are expected to experience an exponential jump in earnings growth after that the stock markets generally do not initially increase the market value of these businesses They do rerate them however around the time when the earnings growth is clearly visible As investors we get an edge over competition if we pick these companies and have the patience and conviction to hold them Al though these businesses are clearly undervalued on a longerterm basis it is psychologically challenging to invest in them and even more so to hold on to them These difficulties result in a lack of investors and the subsequent mispricing of these stocks because the price dis covery is weak when investors attention on these stocks is low Capitalizing on businesses that operate on a longterm timeline of value creation is possible only if we operate with a longterm view as well When you focus on longterm outcomes expect to be frequently misunderstood in the short term This is true not only in business and investing but in life and relationships as well To invest in companies with the capacity to suffer we must be willing to suffer along with them In other words we need a high tolerance for shortterm pain You must buy on the way down There is far more volume on the way down than on the way back up and far less competition among buyers It is almost always better to be too early than too late but you must be prepared for price markdowns on what you buy Seth Klarman Amoney manager must have the resilience to suffer through periodic bouts of underperformance During 1999 Russo was invested in highquality businesses like Nestlé Heineken and Unilever among others They were terribly out of favor relative to the spec ulative forces that were driving the market at the time Russos fund was down 2 percent for the year and the Dow was up 27 percent Dur ing the early part of the following year he was down 15 percent and the market was up by 30 percent Russo was able to stay the course because he had the capacity to suffer The same can be said of his investors at the time This is why the success of an investment manager is as much about his or her ability to vet prospective clients as it is to say no to the wrong type of investment idea Equity investing is like growing a Chinese bamboo tree We should have passion for the journey as well as patience and deep convic tion after planting the seeds The Chinese bamboo tree takes more than five years to start growing but once it starts it grows rapidly to eighty feet in less than six weeks As prominent blogger Anshul Khare once aptly remarked In the initial yearscompounding tests your patience and in later years your bewilderment2 Peter Lynchs investing experiences share a symbolic resemblance to the inspiring bamboo tree story The stocks that have been most rewarding to me have made their greatest gains in the third or fourth year I owned them Stocks can stay cheap for longer than we expect and then may be repriced much more quickly than we expect We should judge our businesses based on their operating results not on the volatility of their stock prices The stock market is focused on the latter but investing success is based on the former If the management team executes the stock eventually follows In fact not getting immediate returns on our existing highquality growth stocks builds antifragility Patience plays a critical role during such times For instance Berkshire Hathaways stock has delivered a CAGR of 21 over the past 42 years as of October 2019 But if you bought it in 1997 you would have had to wait five years before you saw any positive return on the stock Similarly investors in Adobe which as of October 2019 has delivered a CAGR of 24 since its IPO in August 1986 had to undergo a period of thirteen years 2000 2013 during which they made nil return on its stock Investing is hard Very hard It pays to have a longterm view But a longterm investment horizon must be married with an investment process willing to continually question the core investment thesis Investors should exercise active patience that is diligently verifying their original in vestment thesis and doing nothing until something materially adverse or negative emerges All too often when a stock doesnt work out as planned we call it a longterm investment When we spend a lot of time getting to know a business and its management team before investing as we investors often do it becomes difficult to change our mind Investors dont want to feel like all that time was wasted learning things that they didnt act upon We gain an advantage over time by staying intellectually honest while studying new ideas and existing holdings and only investing in the few in which we think the odds are significantly in our favor Investors tend to become com placent and stop questioning their existing holdings when their stock prices are going up They resume analyzing in detail only when the prices start falling Dont analyze your holdings only when they fall Just because the stock price of an existing holding is going up doesnt necessarily mean that nothing negative is happening in its business An Investors Biggest Edge If you want to make money in Wall Street you must have the proper psychological attitude No one expresses it better than Spinoza the philosopherSpinoza said you must look at things in the aspect of eternity Benjamin Graham To make money in stocks you need to have vision to see them courage to buy them and patience to hold them Patience is the rarest of the three Thomas Phelps An investor who can hold on in the face of all of the advice and temptations to ensure a profit by selling an existing position demonstrates a quality of mind quite out of the ordinary Embracing deferred gratification is what leads to the single biggest edge for an investor Human nature makes it difficult to utilize this edge This difficulty is the very reason the edge exists and because human nature will never change this edge is a durable one for those who possess the right temperament to capitalize on it Bezos referred to the source of this edge when he said If everything you do needs to work on a threeyear time horizon then youre competing against a lot of people But if youre willing to invest on a sevenyear time horizon youre now competing against a fraction of those people because very few companies are willing to do that Just by length ening the time horizon you can engage in endeavors that you could never otherwise pursue 4 The ability to have a longterm orientation is now a bigger advantage than ever before Fifty years ago the average holding period for stocks on the New York Stock Exchange was seven years Today it is barely four months The shortterm mindset that is allpervasive in the market creates irrational buying and selling for all sorts of reasons that have everything to do with the shortterm direction of the stock but nothing to do with the longterm value of the business Because the financial community has an everincreasing focus on the next quarter a longterm orientation is a structural competitive advantage for an investor and one that is likely to strengthen over time as we experience information data and noise overload driven by technological innovations and social media The very fact that most of the talent and resources on Wall Street are focused on competing in the shortterm arena of the next few quarters is what leads to a big oppor tunity for those who can look three to five years out and quietly consider the bigger picture Such a longterm orientation helps identify the few key variables that really matter and those variables are rarely if ever the consensus estimates for next quarters EPS or the deci mal point accuracy of the reported margins Capitalizing on others desire to avoid volatility is what makes this strategy work Clients tend to demand constant success and have little patience for shortterm underperformance and this means that fund managers risk losing both assets under management and their jobs also known as career risk if they do not intensely focus on the next month quarter or perhaps year at the most Such clients obviously dont understand that the only three types of investment performance are bad net good but occasionally bad and always good but fraudulent This impatient mindset of clients and the resultant pressure on fund managers to beat their benchmarks every quarter lead to excessive churning of portfolios and high frictional costs This in addition to high expense ratios causes most active fund managers to fail to beat their respective benchmarks SP Dow Jones Indices the de facto scorekeeper

Institutions with access to the best brains and talent de liver such mediocre performance because they suffer from an obsessive desire to avoid volatility The significant importance of staying power

2003 As long as the odds are in our favor and were not risking the whole company on one throw of the dice or anything close to it we dont mind volatility in results What we want are the favorable odds Charlie Munger Dealing with this interim volatility is the price of admission but it is one that few market participants are willing to pay and that is precisely why having a patient mindset focusing on longterm compound annual growth rate CAGR instead of yearly returns and em bracing volatility leads to significant financial rewards This is time arbitrage in action One of the fertile hunting grounds in the markets for practicing time arbitrage is in the area of qualified institutional placement QIP A companys stock price performance is usually negative for many months immediately following a QIP This is because the prevail ing institutional demand for the companys stock gets absorbed in the QIP Management teams drive up the stock price before the QIP by promising the moon to investors during their road show presentations As a result for many months after the QIP the stock does not react to any good news because it has already been discounted Another point that triangulates the Jcurve is that it takes time for the newly infused capital to earn the same return on equity ROE as the seasoned invested capital As a result the lower postQIP ROE imposes an ad ditional drag on the stock price Invest in businesses where you can play the longterm game with likeminded people Investing is a longterm game The more time you give it the lower the odds of disappointment As of September 2019 the range of stock market returns as measured by the SP 500 in any given year since 1950 using data supplied by JP Morgan research has been from 47 percent to 37 percent but over any 5year period that range is 28 percent to 3 percent For any given 20year period the range of returns contracts still further to 17 percent to 6 percent In short since 1950 there has never been any 20year period when investors did not make at least 6 percent per year in the stock market Although past performance is no guarantee of future returns history shows that the longer the time frame the greater are the odds of earning a satisfactory return The longer you can extend your time horizon the less competitive the game becomes because most of the world is engaged over a very short time frame William Browne Keynes referred to our tendency to get swept up by shortterm thinking as animal spirits a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities Markets often overreact to negative but shortterm companyspecific events that have a negligible impact on longterm intrinsic value Critical thinking is always difficult but its almost impossible when we are scared Theres no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear Once fear about one aspect gets into the minds of people they cant see other things some distance away As an illustrative example one should study why Bandhan Banks stock was locked in a 20 percent lower circuit on October 1 2018 During those times focusing on the long term provides a behavioral edge and helps investors avoid making hurried mistakes when the amygdala in their brain triggers a fight orflight response We are emotional first and logical second We are designed that way Automatic processing originates in the evolu tionarily older parts of the brain also known as the lizard brain whose constituents include the cerebellum the basal ganglia and the amygdala The deliberative mind operates out of the prefrontal cortex which is part of the frontal lobe In his book Seeking Wisdom Peter Bevelin writes It is a natural tendency to act on impulseto use emotion before reason The behaviors that were critical for survival and reproduction in our evolutionary history still apply today Hyperbolic Discounting Neuroscience has shown that the human brain processes value over different time periods inconsistently We are shortterm demanding and longterm inattentive Our brain is hardwired for immediate rewards Since people first began investing they have been searching for a magic formula for instant wealth It is human nature to seek instant gratification and the market is dominated by individuals who sim ply do not want to wait for much larger rewards several years down the line Asa result many investors end up engaging in hyperbolic discounting heavily discounting the distant but large cash flows of highquality businesses by applying high equity risk premiums and they end up with much lower estimates of intrinsic business value than otherwise would have been the case Consequently even though those businesses may be fairly valued in the short term they end up becoming grossly undervalued on a longterm basis Professor Sanjay Bakshi illustrated this anomaly in his seminal October 2013 white paper on how quality businesses frequently end up getting mispriced by the market2 Any stock that has compounded at 15 percent to 20 percent for decades was by definition undervalued by the market for long periods of time The Way to Wealth Investing is forgoing consumption now in order to have the ability to consume more at a later date Warren Buffett The path to lasting wealth is deferred gratification savings and compound interest Develop the habit of saving in such a way that you enjoy your present reasonably well and also ensure a bright future tomorrow Save enough so that you are able to live a better lifestyle in the future than you are living today Reducing your desires has the same effect as increasing your wealth but with no downside risk Being content in life and having fewer needs enables you to be happy in any situation And that is real wealth and freedom It is why Epictetus said Selfsufficiency is the greatest of all wealth Wealth consists not in having great possessions but in having few wants When you save and invest prudently the benefits are deferredbut crucially they are also compounded The US retirement sys tem greatly rewards those who defer gratification Claiming social security at age seventy leads to 76 percent higher inflationprotected benefits compared with claiming at age sixtytwo Resist instant gratification Embrace delayed gratification Wealth in fact is what you dont see Its the cars not purchased The diamonds not bought The renovations postponed the clothes forgone and the firstclass upgrade declined Its assets in the bank that havent yet been converted into the stuff you see Morgan Housel simple steps can help you cut your costs You can cook your own food buy goods on discount turn down the heat during the winter and wear a sweater at home and eliminate any spending not 100 percent necessary Learn to cherish frugality It will be the steppingstone to your financial freedom I feel proud of the fact that I did not buy a single expensive item during my first three years of living in America and even after getting a highpaying job I used to walk to and from my office every day except the snowy winter days to save money on cab rides During my initial years in the United States as a hotel clerk working for minimum wage I used to checkin guests help them with their luggage and occasionally wash dishes in the kitchen I bought used books to save money Today I cherish those memories During his interview with Jason Zweig in September 2014 Munger remarked that few people have the deferred gratification gene Its waiting that helps you as an investor and a lot of people just cant stand to wait If you didnt get the deferredgratification gene youve got to work very hard to overcome that emphasis added22 Why did Munger say this To understand the deep reason behind it we need to travel back many centuries in time In his book Sapiens Yuval Harari explains the gorging gene theory We need to delve into the huntergatherer world that shaped us the world that we subconsciously still inhabit Why for example do people gorge on highcalorie food that is doing little good to their bodies Todays affluent societies are in the throes of a plague of obesity which is rapidly spreading to developing countries Its a puzzle why we binge on the sweetest and greasiest food we can find until we consider the eating habits of our forager forebears In the savannahs and forests they inhabited highcalorie sweets were extremely rare and food in general was in short supply Atypical forager 30000 years ago had access to only one type of sweet foodripe fruit If a Stone Age woman came across a tree groaning with figs the most sensible thing to do was to eat as many of them as she could on the spot before the local baboon band picked the tree bare The instinct to gorge on highcalorie food was hardwired into our genes emphasis added Today we may be living in highrise apartments with overstuffed refrigerators but our DNA still thinks we are in the savannah Thats what makes us spoon down an entire tub of Ben Jerrys when we find one in the freezer and wash it down with a jumbo Coke2 All specific human cravings are modern manifestations of broad evolutionary desires The deeprooted desire to gorge on all avail able sweet fruit out of fear of losing it to the local baboon remains within us even today We gorge on the food we know is bad for us and chase the stocks we understand may be very risky for us This is because we fear missing out on the instant gratification we may get from consuming and buying them If we are not born with the deferred gratification gene is there no way to inculcate it As it turns out this problem has a simple solution Its simple but not easy It requires a tremendous amount of patience consistency dedication and a deep conviction in the power of compounding One Small Step at a Time One Small Step Can Change Your Life The Kaizen Way by Robert Maurer is one of my favorite books It talks about the power of compound ing small daily positive actions This small book talks about the big idea of kaizen which is Japanese for taking small steps for continual improvement The difference between those who fail and those who succeed is the courage to actrepeatedly Most people when faced with change will feel at least some element of fear Very often that fear can get in the way of actually making the change The idea of kaizen is to make such small changes in your life that your brain doesnt even realize that you are trying to change and therefore doesnt get in the way Kaizen is a neat mental hack that helps us bypass our brains fear response In his book Maurer talks about six strategies that can help us bring about big changes in our life over a period of time 1 Asking small questions 2 Thinking small thoughts 3 Taking small actions 4 Solving small problems 5 Giving small rewards 6 Recognizing small moments Start SmallReally SmallEven Smaller Usually if we try to tackle a big life change all at oncelike completely cutting out sugar or learning to invest in the stock market or incul cating a reading habitit might work for a while but we will give up soon This is because the big changes trigger the brains subconscious fears which end up hindering us So taking small incremental steps is the way to get past that and succeed For instance when it comes to investing in the stock market we overwhelm ourselves with big questions like How can I pick the best stock for my portfolio or How will I ever become a successful investor when others have failed Instead use kaizen and focus on small questions like What little step could I take today toward learning how to pick stocks effectively If you want to form the habit of reading one annual report a day start with reading one page of an annual report a day then increase it to two pages then three and so on Kaizen is how I learned to use the treadmill effectively in the gym when I first started trying to lose weight The very thought of briskly walking nonstop for thirty minutes on highincline mode seemed impossible to me and I did not want to even try But then I started with slow walking on low incline for five minutes a day then six minutes at a slightly faster speed on a slightly higher incline after some time then seven minutes at a slightly faster speed on a slightly higher incline and so on Eventually I reached my target duration speed and incline level The idea is to make it simple habitual and fun And nobody can say they dont have an extra minute a day right You see big bold actions like lofty New Years resolutions often get us initial results but they dont take into account things like fear or mental resistance The smaller steps however get us to the desired goal because they can be incorporated more easily into our daily life Small steps make delaying gratification easier and sustainable So whether it is quitting a bad habit or forming a good one the idea is to start small very small and then to build on it over time figure 111 As the saying goes If we are facing in the right direction all we have to do is keep on walking 1 BETTER EVERY DAY 1 worse every day for one year 099 0003 365 1 better every day forone year 101 3778 Resuurs 1 IMPRoveEMENT Time Figure 111 The effects of small habits compound over time For example if you can get just 1 percent better each day youll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year Source James Clear Atomic Habits New York Avery 2018 used by permission of the author In the challenging journey of pursuing financial independence a supportive partner plays a crucial role Delaying gratification means sacrifice and investors spouses tend to embrace their partners dream as their own It is these shared longterm goals that keep their home warm and comfortable during any of those initial tough years I have nothing but utmost respect and admiration for such gen uine relationships of care affection and true love SECTION III COMMON STOCK INVESTING CHAPTER 12 BUILDING EARNING POWER THROUGH A BUSINESS OWNERSHIP MINDSET Investing is most intelligent when it is most businesslike Benjamin Graham W arren Buffett has shared great insights on having a business ownership mindset in his 1977 letter to shareholders Our experience has been that prorata portions of truly outstanding businesses sometimes sell in the securities markets at very large discounts from the prices they would command in negotiated transactions involving entire companies Consequently bargains in business ownership which simply are not available directly through corporate acquisition can be obtained indirectly through stock ownership When prices are appropriate we are willing to take very large positions in selected companies not with any intention of taking control and not foreseeing sellout or merger but with the expectation that excellent business results by corporations will translate over the long term into correspondingly excellent market value and dividend results for owners minor ity as well as majority We invested 109 million in Capital Cities Communications during 1977 Capital Cities possesses both extraordinary properties and extraordinary management And these management skills extend equally to operations and employment of corporate capital To purchase directly properties such as Capital Cities owns would cost in the area of twice our cost of purchase via the stock market and direct ownership would offer no important advantages to us While control would give us the opportunityand the responsibilityto manage operations and corporate resources we would not be able to provide management in either of those respects equal to that now in place In effect we can obtain a better management result through noncontrol than control This is an unorthodox view but one we believe to be sound Once a strong foundation is created for a business owners dont work for money Rather money works for them As an investor your money is working for you 247 You are becoming wealthier with each passing second alongside the increasing intrinsic value of your businesses Tick tick tick An investor builds earnings power through a business ownership mindset Investing in publicly listed businesses is a great way to passively reap most of the major benefits of running ones own business without being exposed to the disproportionate risks emanating from the usual vagaries of directly running a business Such a passive approach offers multiple benefits 1 The possibility of partly owning a business with a small investment corpus For a person coming from the middle class capital is usually a big limitation to starting a business This is not to say that if a person has a great idea he or she will not find the needed capital to fund it Often however this is the most challenging part of starting a business Suppose someone wants to set up a smallscale chemical factory in the state of West Bengal India The minimum initial equity contribution required may be of the tune of approximately INR 10 million or about US140000 This might mean investing ones entire life savings in a single venture which may or may not work out Alternatively that person could invest just a fraction of this amount and own part of Vinati Organics the worlds largest manufacturer of isobutyl benzene IBB and 2acrylamido 2methylpropane sulfonic acid ATBS It would take years if not decades to replicate its global market leadership from scratch If one looks at return on capital employed Vinati generates returns in excess of 30 percent Thus even with a smaller ticket size an investor could generate better returns on capital employed than could have been obtained in most cases from a privately owned chemical factory 2 Minimizing risk through diversification An investor can enjoy part ownership of ten to fifteen of the best businesses in exis tence at any time Diversification reduces the risk of losing capital entirely which could happen for any unfortunate or unforeseen reason if you own only one business Because ones capital is spread across various businesses this mitigates idiosyncratic individual company specific risk No matter how well you may know your stocks every business has unknown risks Few can know about a Satyam an Enron ora Ricoh India in advance Diversification also protects investors from the risk of ruin as a result of a natural calamity or any other signifi cantly adverse development in one or two businesses Take the example of the April 2015 earthquake in Nepal Had I been directly running and managing only a single business operating in that location I could have been potentially wiped out or it would have taken a long time to recoup my losses in the form of general in surance proceeds if the business was covered by it at all In contrast even though the plant belonging to one of my portfolio companies Hester Biosciences was disrupted by that earthquake I was able to comfortably weather the storm because at the time my portfolio consisted of many other businesses that were not affected at all Sometimes factors like currency depreciation or rising interest rates hurt some of our portfolio companies while benefiting others so that the overall impact is muted Most notably if we invest in a diversified portfolio of good businesses then most of the time the tailwinds pushing a few businesses forward will compensate for the headwinds pushing back the others thus protecting us from permanent loss of capital 3 Access to topnotch managers to run the business When investing in the stock market an investor gains access to topnotch managerial talent free of cost Investors are given an opportunity to ride in the passenger seat next to people who have complementary skills that are specific to them and this has significant value This is also known as sidecar investing As an investor in the company these skills are made available to us at zero cost but the benefits we derive can be enormous In contrast when running a private business access to people with such skills can be prohibitively expensive and hence the odds of making extraordinary returns are significantly lower 4 Buying business ownership on your own terms This is what Graham was referring to when he talked about an investors basic advantage It is important to choose our battles wisely and we should choose those for which the odds of winning are clearly in our favor Life often does not give us an opportunity to choose our battles but the stock market gives us the invaluable flexibility of choosing not only the battle we want to fight but also in many cases the battleground and the timing of the fight as well Human beings are a messy living compilation of a multitude of cognitive and behavioral biases especially when it comes to matters related to money The auctiondriven nature of the stock market which is a heady cocktail of swirling human emotions and sentiments makes it the perfect place to look for pockets of periodic irrational behavior which is sometimes extreme to the point of being ludicrous Greed and fear are always present in abundance in the market and the most recent marginal opinion not longterm intrinsic value de termines the present stock price This sets a perfect stage for getting incredible bargains that no private business owner ina sane state of mind would ever offer For a businessperson the stock market is the best place to look at buying businesses at substantial discounts or selling them at staggering premiums The biggest advantage for an individual investor is the option to calmly wait until identifying a business that is available at a significant discount to intrinsic value Ina private transaction this simply is not possible Just imagine what would happen if you offered to buy a growing and highly profitable business at less than the amount of cash sitting on the books You most likely would be thrown out the door As an investor in the stock market however you may get opportunities to invest in such cash bargains during ones lifetime 5

lot of time to complete all the closing formalities and to wind up the business The process is far more cumbersome if it is a private limited company All of the compliance requirements must be met until every account is settled and money has been distributed to all stakeholders If the business involves more than one partner the matter is further complicated if any of them want to continue the business while you want to exit When investing in a stock however even though you are a part owner of the business you can exit your entire holding for any ur gent or personal reason with the click of a mouse and the entire sale proceeds will be deposited in your bank account in a matter of days This flexibility and ease of exit is extremely useful when in your judgment the business is going downhill with no tumaround in sight the management shows a lack of integrity or you simply have found a much more profitable alternative in which to invest Stocks Closely Resemble Bonds Ina 1977 Fortune article Buffett explained how stocks closely resemble bonds An understanding of the finer nuances of his teachings on this topic enable us as part owners of a business and one of the two primary providers of capital bondholders and shareholders to appre ciate the subtle similarities between the two components of enterprise value ie debt and equity 1 Coupon A companys equity coupon is the owner earnings it generates Our job as investors is to ascribe a value to those coupons A portion of the coupon is handed out as a dividend The investor is free to do what he wants with that cash but the remaining portion of the companys earnings is retained within The amount of earnings a company retains from year to year is left to the companys discretion Earnings retention is one of the lesser appreciated marvels of capitalism It provides anyone with a brokerage account and some patience cheap access to the productive power of a business or an entire market economy if investing in a total market index fund 2 Maturity Stocks are meant to be perpetual and do not have an obvious maturity date Businesses are going concerns which means they are intended to last forever Creative destruction however has ensured that few companies in history have been able to survive forever In fact most companies have extinguished their stock well before infinity But the timing of these events can never be known in advance with certainty So although businesses exist under the assumption of operating forever the reality is that their stocks have uncertain maturity dates 3 Par value The par value of a stock is the book value of its equity This is an accounting value that approximates the value of a business to its shareholders if it were to stop operations immediatelythat is it does not account for future growth It is the difference between what a company owns assets and what that company owes to others liabilities Buffett has cautioned investors not to confuse book value with intrinsic value Of course its pershare intrinsic value not book value that counts Book value is an accounting term that mea sures the capital including retained earnings that has been put into a business Intrinsic value is a presentvalue estimate of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life At most companies the two values are unrelated2 Buffetts insights are valuable because they remind us that stocks are not just pieces of paper but fractional ownership stakes in real businesses They are a claim to a piece of a businesss profits which grows as the business invests in productive activities executes well and generates returns The sheer delight that we as passionate investors experience whenever any of our portfolio companies signs up a new client wins a landmark contract completes the execution of an order before the stipulated time embarks on a promising expansion or receives recog nition for corporate excellence is something that cannot be described It has to be felt from within Be passionate about the business but dispassionate about the stock Celebrate the big successes of your businesses and reflect on failures A true feeling of ownership gives an investor the conviction to hold When you think like a business owner you no longer view stocks as pieces of paper or buy them with target prices in mind Instead you view stocks as part ownership in a business and you want to savor the journey alongside the promoters As companies grow larger and more profitable their stockholders share in the increased profits and dividends Invest for the long term Live fully today Every day millions of hardworking people around the world are doing great things at so many companies As investors we are thankful CHAPTER 13 INVESTING BETWEEN THE LINES Perhaps 90 percent of our shares are owned by investors for whom Berkshire is their largest security holding very often far and away the largest Many of these owners are willing to spend a significant amount of time with the annual report and we attempt to provide them with the same information we would find useful if the roles were reversed Warren Buffett hen we start researching an investment idea the first thing we want to know is whether the business is sound and profitable We read the companys annual report for numbers like net income debt cash flow profitability ratios and the like We as sume that these audited numbers must be accurate and authentic But even Enrons and Satyams numbers were certified by auditors and both of them ended up as big accounting scandals and corporate frauds In general be extra diligent with firms that have convoluted structures such as a large number of subsidiaries and crossholdings Asan investor how do we know that the management is telling us the truth And how does an honest CEO communicate with the shareholders in a manner that establishes trust Laura Rittenhouse in her book Investing Between the Lines attempts to answer these questions She offers clues to separate the facts from the fluff in annual reports corporate communications and quarterly earnings calls Through the ideas in her book Rittenhouse helps us cut through the noise and enables us to better decode CEO communication Capital Stewardship If we do the right things the stock price will take care of itself and our shareholders will be rewarded Jim Sinegal Companies that are focused on stewarding investor capital tend to deliver superior returns over time Rittenhouse writes As an investor your goal is to find businesses which are run by leaders who steward capital and are accountable for their words and actions Capital Stew ardship reveals whether a CEOs actions are based on attitudes of being entrusted with or entitled to investor capital To check for the presence of capital stewardship look for clues related to the following topics in shareholder letters annual reports and other executive communications Capital discipline CEOs who are good capital allocators typically offer commentary about returns on investment on invested capital and on assets The strength or weakness of a CEOs capital discipline is expressed in the commentary about book value or market value Ask these questions while reading the annual report commentary Is capital allocation discussed explicitly and rationally Are words consistent with actions Are actions and words consistent over time Cash flow Recurring cash flows are crucial for longterm sustainability of a business This is why many investors like to invest in stocks of smallticket consumer nondurables which are purchased almost as a matter of habit and whose consumption cannot be indefinitely delayed For this very reason within cyclical industries consumableoriented businesses enjoy higher valuations than capexoriented ones which have a long replacement cycle Given its importance investors might expect every shareholder letter to include commentary on operating and free cash flow But most letters fail to report on this aspect Look for CEOs who place a great deal of emphasis on cash flows and communicate about it in a clear manner Also look at a companys balance sheet and cash flow statement to see whether the cash flow numbers listed in those financial statements match with the numbers in the CEOs communication Operating and financial goals Meaningful financial goal statements indicate that a CEO is serious about efficient capital alloca tion Instead of stating goals as platitudes such as our goal is to delight all our customers effective CEOs provide meaningful context around quantifiable goal statements Ask yourself What are the CEOs incentives How does the CEO get paid Is there a returnoninvestment component Look for CEOs and insiders who have low salaries and high stock ownership as they get rich only when shareholders get rich CEOs who publish meaningful financial and operating goals and focus on capital discipline cash flow and balance sheet health are exemplars of capital stewardship Candor Candor is the language of trust and it means being authentic with your words As Warren Buffett puts it We will be candid in our report ing to you emphasizing the pluses and minuses important in appraising business value Our guideline is to tell you the business facts that we would want to know if our positions were reversed We owe you no less2 Buffett exemplifies the pinnacle of candor in CEO communication with shareholders He quantifies not only the accounting cost of his errors but also their opportunity cost In his 2014 letter he wrote Berkshire paid 433 million for Dexter and rather promptly its value went to zero GAAP generally accepted accounting principles accounting however doesnt come close to recording the magnitude of my error The fact is that I gave Berkshire stock to the sellers of Dexter rather than cash and the shares I used for the purchase are now worth about 57 billion As a financial disaster this one deserves a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records The easiest way to test for candor is to invert the problem and test for the absence of candor How can we test for the absence of can dor in an executive communication Rittenhouse writes When Rittenhouse Rankings analyzes a shareholder letter we start reading with a red pencil or pen in hand and use it to underline clichés such as employees are our greatest assets our future is bright advancing momentum and we aim to create share holder value This kind of meaningless jargon and platitudes diminishes our understanding of the business and our trust in the leadership When we finish coding a communication we look back at the pages If we see more red than black ink on the pages we put a company on probation We dig further to examine the companys accounting and its marketplace claims This was certainly true of Enron whose 2000 shareholder letter offered the following linguistic anesthesia Our talented people global presence financial strength and massive market knowledge have created our sustainable and unique businesses EnronOnline will accelerate their growth We plan to leverage all of these competitive advantages to create sig nificant value for our shareholders In one short paragraph Enron introduced six popular CEO clichés Talented people Global presence Market knowledge Fi nancial strength Leverage competitive advantages Significant value for our shareholders Each competitive advantage is an important business concept but so many generalities are meaningless to the reader Not only do these clichés fail to inspire trust but they should cause a prudent investor to wonder what the company might be hiding Investors who read between the lines and look for the absence of candor can spot companies like this that may be headed for troubles Its not that the content CEOs write in their letters and other communication is difficult to understand Sometimes the content is deliberately written in a way not to be understood Restructuring is one of the more abused words we hear from CEOs who have made highly expensive blunders in the past and now want to get back on track only to make more such blunders in the future Onetime re structuring expenses often turn out to be perpetual Sadly investors never receive even a small apology from the CEOs and executives re sponsible for such costly mistakes Most annual reports and other such financial disclosures are written not to inform readers but rather to protect the provider of the information Thats because most issuers of equities debt and other financing instruments are apprehensive that if they communicated in plain simple English someone might actually understand just what was at stake Just imagine if an investment banker said or an initial public offering IPO prospectus read You could lose all your money if you buy this Rittenhouse has coined an acronym for the absence of candor FOG or factdeficient obfuscating generalities Investors who find a foggedover communication presence of clichés jargon and hyperbole need to ask Does the CEO not understand the business or does he or she not want owners to understand it When we read something full of jargon and clichés we often presume that we are not smart enough to understand it and we under appreciate our personal judgment Rittenhouse writes Is it because we fear our vulnerability in relation to leaders whom we must trust To imagine that they would injure us to advance their selfinterest is disturbing even frightening Instead we choose to doubt ourselves If you feel that you are not smart enough to understand whats written in the corporate communications then dont worry This is not your problem It is the managements responsibility to write the letter in a manner that can be easily comprehended by the average reader To evaluate the quality of the management you dont need privileged access to insider information The secret is right in front of youin black and whitein the words of every shareholder letter annual report and other corporate correspondence Once you learn how to read between the lines in the corporate communications you can make a better assessment about management quality and their intentions Remember analyzing words is just as important as analyzing numbers CHAPTER 14 THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF CHECKLISTS IN DECISIONMAKING Checklist routines avoid a lot of errors You should have all this elementary worldly wisdom and then you should go through a mental checklist in order to use it There is no other procedure in the world that will work as well Charlie Munger about our capabilities A checklist can remind us that we are not infallible that we do make mistakes and that we should not be A fair amount of research has been done in the past that suggests the immense value of checklists We tend to be overconfident too sure about our decisions Use the following general principles when devising a checklist Good checklists are brief precise efficient and easy to use even under difficult conditions They do not try to spell out everything and they provide reminders of only the critical and most important steps Bad checklists are vague imprecise too long hard to use and try to spell out every single step Checklists should be confirmed perform jobstasks from memory and experience but then stop run the checklist and confirm that everything was done correctly Checklists should be reviewed carry out tasks as they are checked off Checklists should include some dealbreaker questions as well as other questions that may require tradeoffs Investing in stocks is not as complex as doing a medical surgery or flying an airplane but checklists still play an important role In one of her past interviews Alice Schroeder discussed Warren Buffetts use of disqualifying features as one of his checklist items Typically and this is not well understood his way of thinking is that there are disqualifying features to an investment So he rifles through and as soon as you hit one of those its done Doesnt like the CEO forget it Too much tail risk forget it Lowmargin busi ness forget it Many people would try to see whether a balance of other factors made up for these things He doesnt analyze from A to Z its a timewaster emphasis added1 Charlie Munger has often been credited with popularizing the use of checklists in investing In Poor Charlies Almanack Peter Kaufman summarized Mungers investing principles risk independence preparation intellectual humility analytic rigor allocation pa tience decisiveness change and focus in a checklist form This is a mustread for all investors Its not the answers that make you good in the investing business its the questions you ask Ask the right questions youll get valu able answers Do the initial groundwork A prudent investor never purchases ownership in a company without conducting the necessary due diligence Learn about the company and its competitors both listed and unlisted from company websites filings and information on the Internet Read the past ten years worth of annual reports proxies notes and schedules to the financial statements and management discussion and analysis check for changes in tone and industry outlook and observe the recent trends in insider shareholding Accounting is the language of business and a basic understanding of its fundamentals is essential for investors Because account ing is a doubleentry system even a false entry needs to be matched by an offsetting number If one of the three accounting statements income statement cash flow and balance sheetis falsified traces will show up in the other two Everything must add up arithmetically even if the company is fraudulently misclassifying key figures A simple triangulation exercise will help you spot accounting shenanigans in time For example if net income receives too much attention study the inventories and receivables on the balance sheet When analyz ing the quarterly or semiannual results of any company investors always should first check the balance sheet for any red flag items before even taking a look at the income statement After you have concluded the initial groundwork study the following parameters in a checklist fashion 1 Income Statement Profit and Loss Account Analysis Sales growth The higher sales growth is the better provided it is profitable Over the long term stock returns are highly correlated to sales growth as margins revert to the mean Organic growth driven by internal accruals is most desirable Be cautious of high growth driven primarily by bigticket acquisitions Gross profit margin Focus on the trend over the years If it is fluctuating a lot in a cyclical manner then it means that the company does not have pricing power over its customers and is not able to pass on increases in raw material cost On the contrary if it is high and stable or improving over the years then the company in question may have an economic moat Dig deeper in such cases as well as when acom panys operating margins are much higher than that of its industry peers Interest income usually shown as other income Check the cash and investments figure on the balance sheet If the interest income is not at least equal to the banks fixed deposit return then analyze it deeper to see where the company has invested its cash Interest expense A lowinterest expense or a highinterest coverage ratio in isolation should never be taken at face value Always check whether the company has been capitalizing the interest cost Multiply the total debt figure by the prevailing rate of interest for similarly rated corporations and compare that figure with the total interest expense number used in the calculation of the interest coverage ratio Employee cost In fraudulent companies the reported figure may be grossly out of line when evaluated against the existing number of employees stated in the company filings or on the website Other expenses Several miscellaneous expenses are aggregated under this heading which makes for a rich conduit for leakage A sharp rise in other expenses in a depressed market or slowing economy could point to money being siphoned off Taxes The tax payout ratio should be near the standard corporate tax rate If it is low then check whether the company has accumulated losses from the past or if it is enjoying tax incentives from operating out of a special economic zone or other taxadvantaged jurisdictions Net profit margin The higher this margin is the better Be wary of companies that show high sales growth with declining profit margins Companies that chase growth at the cost of profitability usually do not create sustainable wealth for shareholders 2 Cash Flow Analysis Cash flow from operating activity CFO The higher the CFO is the better Compare the CFO with net profit over the years to see whether the funds are getting stuck in or released from working capital Capital expenditure capex Compare capex with the CFO to see whether the company can fund its capital expenditures from its operat ing cash flow Companies that show high sales growth without much capex potentially could be capitallight compounders Total debt The lower the debt is the better High debt for nonfinance businesses signifies living beyond ones means Avoid companies that heavily depend on the kindness of strangers Cash balances Very high cash levels in companies that do not pay dividends should be viewed with caution The cash shown on the bal ance sheet may be fictitious Free cash flow FCF This is the discretionary surplus that can be distributed to reward shareholders The higher the proportion of FCF out of the CFO the better If FCF is negative and the dividend is always funded by debt then the investor should not take any comfort from a high dividend yield Ifa company is not ever able to generate FCF then it may be the equivalent of a perpetual Ponzi scheme wherein it simply robs Peter to pay Paul Remember intrinsic value is derived from the cash that can be taken out of a business during its lifetime When a company reports profits but bleeds cash believe the cash Always The most common symptoms of falsified earnings are negative free cash flow accompanied by rising debt increasing shares outstanding and bloating in receivables inventory noncurrent investments and intangibles 3 Return Ratios Analysis Selfsustainable growth rate SSGR This represents the debtfree SSGR potential of a company Companies growing at a higher rate than SSGR are using more resources than their inherent operations can generate and they experience increasing debt levels An SSGR higher than the sales growth rate is desirable Profit before taxaverage net fixed assets The higher this ratio is the better A company should earn more on its tangible assets as well as tangible equity and capital employed than the banks fixed deposit rate Pretax return on tangible equity The higher the pretax return is the better Tangible equity is calculated by subtracting intangible assets and preferred equity from the companys book value Be cautious of companies for which the high return on equity figure is being primar ily driven by higher leverage Return on capital employed The higher this return is the better This is calculated as earnings before interest and taxes divided by capi tal employed 4 Operating Efficiency Analysis Net fixed asset turnover ratio The higher this ratio is the better A high ratio shows that the company sweats its fixed assets in an effi cient manner Receivables days The lower the number of days the better A higher number means that the company is giving customers a longer credit period to generate sales In case of fictitious sales in which cash is not received from customers the number of receivables days will be constantly increasing Inventory turnover ratio The higher this ratio is the better Lower inventory turnover means that the company is accumulating a lot of inventory which might become obsolete later 5 Balance Sheet Analysis Net fixed assets Look for sharp increases in this figure on the balance sheet These increases signify that the company has completed a capex program which could drive higher sales and profits in the future Capital work in progress Look for sharp increases in this figure on the balance sheet These increases signify that the company is cur rently undertaking a capex program which may be on the verge of completion Share capital Ideally the share count should be constant over the years or it should decrease because of buyback An increase in share capital that is not due to bonus shares represents a dilution of existing shareholders Keep in mind that stock splits and bonuses affect only the liquidity of a stock not its intrinsic value Debttoequity ratio The lower this ratio is the better Check for offbalance sheet exposures like underfunded pension liabilities dis puted legal claims noncancelable operating leases and contingent liabilities like corporate guarantees for loans taken by promoterowned group entities Test the debt serviceability through interest coverage earnings before interest and taxesinterest and FCF A company may have a low debttoequity ratio but still face financial stress if the cash is insufficient to meet the nearterm payment obligations 6 Management Analysis Study the background and credentials of promoters and search the Internet for any corporate governance issues Use keywords like fraud scam litigation investigation and the like Management red flags include exorbitant salaries perks and commissions most worrisome if paid during a period of losses a high percentage of insider holdings being pledged promoters merging their weaker privately owned companies into their publicly listed company engaging in significant relatedparty transactions appointing relatives who lack adequate qualifications using aggressive accounting practices frequently changing auditors changing the company name to include buzzwords from the hot sectors currently in high demand and engaging in overly promotional activities such as quoting broker reports for its revenue or profit guidance and issuing frequent but meaningless press releases and announcements A hard sell usually indicates that some form of financing is impending Show me a promoter who is obsessed with the companys stock price and Ill show you a business that guzzles cash and constantly needs to raise money Always read the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in annual and quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filings to assess the capitalraising needs of the business you are researching 7 Mungers Psychological Checklist of the Standard Causes of Human Misjudgment Bias from mere association This bias automatically connects a stimulus with pain or pleasure It includes liking or disliking something associated with something good or bad and includes seeing situations as identical because they seem similar Underestimating the power of rewards and punishment People repeat actions that result in rewards and avoid actions for which they are punished If people dont have to pay for a benefit they tend to overuse it After a success we become overly optimistic risk takers After a failure we become overly pessimistic and risk averse This happens even in cases in which success or failure was merely a result of chance We do not improve the man we hang we improve others by him Tie incentives to performance Ensure that people share both the upsides and downsides Make them understand the link between their performance their reward and what you want to accomplish Re ward individual performance not effort or length of time in the organization Underestimating bias from ones own selfinterest and incentives Persuade others by asking them questions that highlight the conse quences of their actions Appeal to interest not to reason Selfserving bias This bias encourages an overly positive view of our abilities or being overly optimistic Successes always draw far more attention in the media than failures The more we think we know about a subject the less willing we are to use other ideas We solve a problem in a way that agrees with our method of expertise Always ask How might I be wrong Selfdeception and denial When we practice denial we engage in a distortion of reality to reduce pain This includes wishful thinking As Demosthenes said What a man wishes he will believe Bias from consistency and commitment tendency This bias causes us to remain consistent with prior commitments and ideas even in the face of disconfirming evidence This includes confirmation biasthat is looking for evidence that confirms our beliefs and ignoring or distorting disconfirming evidence to reduce the stress from cognitive dissonance We tend to double down on our failed efforts because of the sunk cost fallacy The more time or money we spend on something the less likely we are to abandon it When we have made an in vestment we tend to seek evidence to confirm that we made the right decision and to ignore information that shows we made the wrong one As Buffett has said What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact2 The more publicity a decision receives the less likely it is that we will change it Rigid convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies It is better to be right than to be consistent Calibration requires an openminded consideration of diverse points of view and exploration of alternative hypotheses You are more likely to be right if you try to prove yourself wrong You should hold and explore conflicting possibilities in your mind while steadily advancing toward what is likely to be the truth based on what you learn along the way If you find yourself in a hole stop digging To admit you are wrong means you are wiser today than yesterday The greatest enemy of truth is the innate desire to win every argument Learning is what happens when you end up justifiably agreeing with people who disagree with you Welcome criticism when you see it is sincere founded on knowledge and given in a spirit of helpfulness Growth requires a steadfast commitment to pivot and adapt Be openminded and always triangulate your thesis with people who see things differently from you By engaging them in thought ful disagreement you will gain a better understanding of their reasoning and allow them to stress test your thoughts In this way you will raise your probability of being right Remember you are looking for the right answer not merely the best one that you can come up with on your own Just try to be rightit doesnt matter if the right answer comes from someone else As Karl Popper said The aim of an argument or of a discussion should not be victory but progress Focus on understanding not on agreement or disagreement Judgment follows understanding not vice versa Bias from deprival syndrome This strong reaction comes when something we like and have or have almost obtained is or threatens to be taken away or lost It includes desiring and valuing more of what we cant have People respond to immediate threats Anything that happens gradually tends to get ignored If compliance practitioners want a person to take a risk they try to make him feel as if he is behind Status quo bias and donothing syndrome This bias keeps things the way they are It minimizes effort and supports a preference for default options Our unconscious mind rules our behavior Our senses send our brains roughly 11 million bits of information per second vastly more than our conscious processing capacity which maxes out at an estimated fifty bits per second Research studies show that this bias could be due to the fact that challenging mental activities require more of the bodys basic fuel glucose When we avoid hard thinking we save mental energy We are programmed to be lazy and are naturally inclined to follow the path of least resistance that is doing what is easy rather than doing what is required Impatience When we are impatient we value the present more highly than the future Bias from envy and jealousy People will do many things to feel loved They will do all things to be envied Distortion by contrast comparison This bias involves judging and perceiving the absolute magnitude of something not by itself but rather based only on its difference from something else when presented closely in time or space or from some earlier adaptation This in cludes underestimating the consequences of gradual changes over time low contrast Bias from anchoring When we anchor we overweigh certain information often arbitrary and meaningless as a reference point for fu ture decisions Overinfluence from vivid or recent events Always back up stories with facts and numbers Many times the data refutes the anecdotes but people still prefer to believe the latter Peoples minds usually dont change with data when the subject matter is an emotional or polit ical issue for them Omission and abstract blindness When we experience this bias we see only stimuli we encounter or that grabs our attention and we neglect important missing information and the abstract Today millions of people did not win the lottery We dont see the quiet losers We dont see those who didnt predict well Missing information doesnt draw our attention This bias includes inattentional blindness Bias from reciprocation tendency We repay in kind what others have done for or to us This bias includes favors concessions attitudes and information sharing Bias from overinfluence by liking tendency We believe trust and agree with people we know and like This includes bias from excessive desire for social acceptance It also includes bias from dislikingour tendency to disagree with people we dont like even though they may be right A good person can make a bad argument A bad person can make a good argument Judge the argument not the person Practice intellectual integrity Bias from overinfluence by social proof We imitate the behavior of similar others This bias includes crowd folly When all are account able no one is accountable Bias from overinfluence by authority We tend to trust and obey perceived authorities or experts Sense making When we construct explanations that fit an outcome we may act too quickly to draw sound conclusions thinking events that have happened were predictable in advance In hindsight everything seems obvious Always assess the quality of previous decisions in the context of the time at which they were made Reason respecting We often comply with requests merely because we have been given a reason If you always tell people why they will consider it more important and they will be more likely to comply People are moved more by what they feel than by what they under stand Believing first and doubting later It can be easy to believe what is not true when in a distracted state Memory limitations This causes us to remember selectively and wrongly This bias includes influence by suggestions Dosomething syndrome We may be prone to take some action just for the sake of being active Mental confusion from saysomething syndrome We often feel a need to say something when we have nothing to say As the saying goes Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt Emotional arousal It is easy to make hasty judgments under the influence of intense emotions This includes exaggerating the emotional impact of future events Mental confusion from stress physical or psychological pain or the influence of chemicals or diseases During the research process conduct an honest emotional selfcheck Write down how you are feeling as well as the main reason you want to buy the stock in question Are you buying just because of the large amount of research and effort you have put into the stock Are you re luctant to accept differing opinions Resist the urge to buy first and study later Avoid buying just because others are buying the stock and making a lot of money offof it Do not fall prey to the fear of missing out Switch off the television and social media If necessary take a break and clear your mind Checklists are a systematic way to engage the rational brain and for investors they can be highly effective vaccines against what Guy Spier calls the cocaine brain You go into the greed mode Neuroscientists have found that the prospect of making money stimu lates the same primitive reward circuits in the brain that cocaine does The ideal checklist is subjective and it varies from individual to individual A borrowed or outsourced checklist is not recom mended Every investor needs to build his or her own checklist based on personal experiences knowledge and previous mistakes A checklist created in this manner would be most useful Munger agrees You need a different checklist and different mental models for different companies I can never make it easy by saying Here are three things You have to derive it yourself to ingrain it in your head for the rest of your life At the end of the day an investor should be selfaware and have a clear understanding of what he or she is trying to achieve In his book Seeking Wisdom Peter Bevelin writes Doing something according to preestablished rules filters and checklists often makes more sense than doing something out of pure emotion But we cant have too many rules filters or items without thinking We must always un derstand what were trying to accomplish emphasis added3 Along with checklists we have another valuable tool to improve our decisionmaking skills Ajournal CHAPTER 15 JOURNALING IS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR SELFREFLECTION Observe all men thy self most Benjamin Franklin It is wisdom to know others It is enlightenment to know ones self Lao Tzu If most of us remain ignorant of ourselves it is because selfknowledge is painful and we prefer the pleasures of illusion aldous Huxley significant part of human memories is mostly fiction We form false memories quite easily Our subconscious brain tends to dis tort certain events before storing them in the form of memories Many research studies have supported the idea of selective memory The human brain is a meaningmaking machine It is always optimizing and conserving energy by extracting the gist of everything When we observe anything our brain immediately tries to glean the meaning of what we see For most people this meaning is personal Memory generally is a product of our preconceived notions and personal biases that is what makes sense to us and how that belief fits into our picture of the world Any information that conflicts with this subjective interpretation is discarded by the brains grey matter In other words our minds are drawn to what feels true not to what is necessarily so Every time we pull out a piece of information from memory we get back a summary that has a lot of missing details To comprehend that piece of memory our brain regenerates some part of it on the fly by imaginatively filling in the missing details with stuff that seems plausible whether or not it actually happened This reconstruction of any piece of memory happens not just once but every time we access it When we remember something we are simply pulling up a number of false details Maybe we are even adding new errors with each act of recall The presence of this feedback loop in memory reconsolidation compounds the problem over time We tend to remember the things we want to remember and forget the things we would rather forget As a result a significant part of our memories is selfdistorted fiction Making effective decisions is a complicated affair but that is our primary task as investors Our job is to make decisions And yet very few of us think about how we engage in decisionmaking Confusing actual experience with a false memory of it can bea big deter rent to learning from our past investing outcomes And if we are not learning effectively from our past experiences we cannot improve our process to make better decisions Because of narrative fallacy hindsight bias and imperfect memory it is almost impossible to recall with 100 percent accuracy the reasons why we made a particular decision in the past Our brain fools us by presenting a distorted picture of the circumstances under which we made the decision which leads to the wrong conclusion about why a stock turned out to be a mis take ora success We often struggle to improve our decisionmaking skills because we rarely receive feedback on the quality of our decisions Good decisions do not guarantee success but bad ones almost always lead to failure The way to test the quality of our decisions is to test the process by which we make them There is a simple way to do this Its simple but not easy Implementing it requires a great deal of humility and intellectual honesty Carry a notebook and track all of your important decisions A decision journal helps you collect accurate and honest feedback on what you were thinking when you made decisions This feedback helps you realize when you were just plain lucky Sometimes things work out well for very different reasons than we initially en visaged The key to understanding the limits to our knowledge is to check the results of our decisions against what we thought was going to happen and why we thought it was going to happen This feedback loop is incredibly important because the mind wont provide it on its own We dont know as much as we think we know We are fooled into thinking that we understand something when we do not and we have no means to correct ourselves Our minds revise history to preserve our view of ourselves The story that we tell ourselves conjures up a linear causeandeffect relationship between a decision we made and the actual outcome The best cure for this cognitive malfunction is a decision journal Maintain a journal that contains your original investment thesis at the time you made the purchase as well as the rationale for making the sale As Robert Heinlein writes man is not a rational animal he is a rationalizing animal After the fact everything seems obvious in hindsight fundamental analysis of any event can be reconstituted and is always brilliant A journal is the most objective way to remain true to yourself and to avoid hindsight bias More important it helps you continuously learn from your mistakes and these insights will be your greatest teachers in life business and investing The significant intrinsic value of learning from ones personal mis takes and even more important learning vicariously from others mistakes over an investing lifetime is grossly underestimated Planning Fallacy and the Critical Role of a Premortem Overly optimistic forecasts of the outcome of projects are evident everywhere This bias a phenomenon in which predictions about how much time or cost will be needed to complete a future task display an overly optimistic view is called planning fallacy a term coined by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky Planning fallacy occurs when plans and forecasts assume a bestcase scenario and ignore the base rates of similar cases in the past This in turn leads to significant time and cost overruns What causes people to succumb to the planning fallacy The inside view according to Kahneman and Tversky is the culprit here The inside view is that which we all spontaneously adopt to assess future prospects When our intuitions pertain to probability and statis tics we shouldnt trust them We tend to focus on specific circumstances and to search for evidence within the small world of our personal experiences a phenomenon known as availability bias When we have information about an individual case we rarely want to know the statistics of the reference class to which the case belongs We tend to forecast based on the information in front of us availability bias again We do not consider the succession of possible events that could cause the task to drag on longer In other words we ignore the very existence of unknown unknowns According to Kahneman taking an outside view is a way to break the overconfidence illusion created by planning fallacy To take an outside view is to take your attention away from your specific case and focus it toward a class of similar cases Check the statistics of success and failure rates of similar cases in the past If you want to know how something is going to turn out for you look at how it turned out for others in similar situations in the pastthe base rate The best investors make a habit of putting procedures in place in advance emphasis added that help inhibit the hot reactions of the emotional brain Jason Zweig Getting exactly what we planned for is anonevent for our brain activity So if we are mentally prepared for the worstcase scenario and have a contingency plan ready to cope with it we will be far less susceptible to overreacting and making costly mistakes under sudden stressful conditions As legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu aptly putt Battles are won or lost before they are fought A premortem is an investigation of a bad outcome but before it happens We tend to bask in an optimistic view of the future and overestimate the probability of favorable outcomes A premortem tempers this innate bias In investing conducting a premortem lets us take appropriate corrective action in a timely manner in the future Before you buy a stock visualize that a year has passed from the date of your purchase and that you have lost money on your investment even in a steady market Now write down on a piece of paper what went wrong in the future This prospective hindsight technique forces you to open up your mind to think in terms of a broad range of outcomes to consider the outside view and to focus your attention on those potential sources of downside risk that did not intuitively come to your mind the first time you thought about buying a stock Visualizing a range of scenarios for variables outside of ones control also helps investors make better decisions for individual position sizing and portfolio construction Many investors do postmortems and glean lessons from decisions made but a premortem begins by assuming that a decision has failed and then asks why Think about what can go wrong before making the investment and keep evaluating it as time passes Avoid compounding in reverse To make money you need to have money In other words to maximize profits you have to minimize losses You must focus on capital preservation above all else Value investors always think about the potential downside risks first when evaluating a potential investment Even the father of value investing Benjamin Graham emphasized return of capital and placed it before return on capital in his definition of investing An investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative When making an investment always ask What can go wrong What will be my reaction if those things do go wrong What are the risks How likely are the risks How big are the risks Can I bear them if they come true When making decisions under conditions of uncertainty always think in terms of consequences and consequences of consequences and not just in probabilities As Benjamin Franklin wrote in Poor Richards Almanack He that builds before he counts the cost acts foolishly and he that counts before he builds finds he did not count wisely Writing Is a Medium for Increased SelfAwareness Understanding and Happiness I spent ten dollars on a journal in late 2014 and I consider it to be one of the best value investments I ever made Since that day Ihave been keeping track of my investing decisions and subsequent developments in a journal This habit has helped me a lot in learning about myself and improving as both an investor and an individual I receive a lot of valuable feedback and use it to correct my biases I also have main tained a personal archive of the media commentary and investor behavior during various episodes of market panic between 2015 and 2019 I find that it is highly beneficial to refer to this information whenever the market undergoes its periodic steep corrections Human behavior in the markets has not really changed much over time The process of structuring our thoughts into a journal entry brings clarity to our thinking Journaling by hand reduces the possibil ity of hindsight bias It is hard to look at your own writing and deny your previous thoughts A periodic review is an important part of the process This is how you start getting better Realizing where you make mistakes why you make them and what the common mistakes are that you tend to make all can help you improve over time Whenever the outcome of a past decision is known revisit your decision journal Odds are you will discover some surprises In many of the favorable outcomes youll commonly find that the original reasoning wasnt right Outcomes distort our thinking a lot Unless you are humble and intellectually honest you will end up taking the wrong lessons from favorable outcomes It is not intuitive to honestly recall how the events unfolded especially after getting a favorable result We may be right a lot of the time but it may well be for the wrong reasons This selfrealization can be humbling It is also how we learn and improve Writing apart from being a communication tool is a thinking tool too It is almost impossible to write one thing and simultane ously think something else When you force your hand to write something it channels your thoughts in the same direction Journaling turns out to be not just a tool for thinking but also a highly effective medium for focusing our thoughts The more you write the more precision of thought you build Writing is a thinking exercise and it acts as a shield against the rusting of our mind It is also a useful tool for retaining what we read and it deepens our understanding An added benefit of journaling is that it deepens commitment The very act of writing things down deepens our resolve to make good things happen in our lives It is like a personal declaration that acts as a constant motivator Journaling has therapeutic benefits too Writing aids selfreflection which is a great way to ease any unhappiness in our lives Writ ing also improves our memory because we remember more when we write down our thoughts and learnings Stephen King says Writing is magic as much the water of life as any other creative art The water is free So drink Write make better decisions and be happier CHAPTER 16 NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF INCENTIVES Never ever think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives Charlie Munger If you want to persuade appeal to interest not to reason Benjamin Franklin My main life lesson from investing selfinterest is the most powerful force on earth and can get people to embrace and defend almost anything Jesse Livermore Never ask anyone for their opinion forecast or recommendation Just ask them what they haveor dont havein their portfolio Nassim Nicholas Taleb To know what people really think pay regard to what they do rather than what they say René Descartes e do that for which we are rewarded and avoid that for which we are punished Incentives are at the root of most of the situations we face and yet we often fail to account for them The behavior we observe is usually the result of incentives we do not observe Incentives carry the power to distort our behavior and blind us to reality In his book Pebbles of Perception Lau rence Endersen writes We can only see a situation with true clarity when we take the time to carefully consider the interests at hand And we understand it even better when we consider how the situation might be different if the underlying interests were different Incentives matter greatlyunderestimate them at your peril People will navigate the shortest path to the incentive emphasis added The curious among us will pay particular attention to incentives monetary or otherwise The iron rule of life is that you get what you reward for People follow incentives the way ants follow sugar Rewards as a valuable psychological tool have been part of the academic vocabulary since the midtwentieth century when behavioral psychologist B F Skinner articulated his philosophy of positive reinforcement a way to shape behavior through reward systems Skinners experiments in operant conditioning and behaviorism are his biggest contributions to the field of psychology Operant conditioning can be summarized as fol lows a behavior is followed by a consequence and the nature of the consequence modifies the organisms tendency to repeat the behavior in the future It is imperative that we think deeply about the incentive systems we create because ignoring the second or thirdorder effects of an incentive system often leads to unintended consequences also known as the Peltzman effect Endersen writes An example is monetary rewards offered to help exterminate unwanted animals such as rats and snakes What authorities failed to foresee was that people would start to breed the rats and snakes It not only is important to have symmetrical incentives but also is crucial to not allow gaming of the system Human beings have the tendency to game systems for their benefit It is better to miss rewarding a desirable behavior than to produce an incentive system that promotes cheating behavior because bad behavior once rewarded is habit forming And then it spreads If we think carefully we can observe the fact that incentivecaused bias and social proof create the lollapalooza of Greshams law Bad behavior drives out good behavior As William Ophuls said As with Greshams law in economics bad values drive out good so the moral currency is continuously debased2 This just goes to show how the interplay of multiple behavioral biases results in extreme irrational outcomes It is why Charlie Munger recommends Antigaming features constitute a huge and necessary part of system design Also needed in the system design is an admonition dread Incentives are not only financial but also include prestige freedom time titles power and admiration Alll of these are powerful incentives And according to Munger few forces are more powerful than incentives Almost everyone thinks he fully recognizes how important incentives and disincentives are in changing cognition and behavior But this is not often so For instance I think Ive been in the top 5 percent of my age cohorts almost all my adult life in understand ing the power of incentives and yet Ive always underestimated that power Never a year passes but I get some surprise that pushes alittle further my appreciation of incentive superpower Often the solution to a behavior problem is to simply align the incentives with the desired goal Munger shares his favorite case study from this context In human affairs what determines the behavior are the incentives for the decision maker From all business my favorite case on incentives is Federal Express The heart and soul of their systemwhich creates the integrity of the productis having all their airplanes come to one place in the middle of the night and shift all the packages from plane to plane If there are delays the whole operation cant deliver a product full of integrity to Federal Express customers And it was always screwed up They could never get it done on time They tried everythingmoral suasion threats you name it And nothing worked Finally somebody got the idea to pay all these people not so much an hour but so much a shiftand when its all done they can all go home Well their problems cleared up overnight Lessons from Berkshire Hathaway for Structuring Incentives in Organizational Settings Capital allocation is a CEOs most important job How he or she allocates capital is what determines the value created for the business and its shareholders in the long run Many CEOs fail in allocating capital because of their incentive structure which is aligned to what they can do in the short term rather than what they should do for the long term This is why Munger says Perhaps the most important rule in management is to get the incentives right In theory stock options should align the interests of managers with shareholders But as Yogi Berra said In theory there is no difference between practice and theory In practice there is Two aspects of stock options make them an ineffective way to incentivize management First they are a capital cost For a manager with a fixed price option retained earnings are freeofcost capital Second managers do not bear any downside risks but shareholders do So it is more like a free lottery ticket for managers In his 1996 letter Warren Buffett explained Berkshire Hathaways incentive compensation principles It is widely regarded as the blueprint for how organizations should design incentive and compensation structures Goals should be 1 tailored to the economics of the specific operating business 2 simple in character so that the degree to which they are being realized can be easily measured and 3 directly related to the daily activities of plan participants As a corollary we shun lottery ticket arrangements such as options on Berkshire shares whose ultimate valuewhich could range from zero to hugeis totally out of the control of the person whose behavior we would like to affect In our view a system that produces quixotic payoffs will not only be wasteful for owners but may actually discourage the focused behavior we value in managers It is important to study the business understand its key value drivers and then bind the incentives with those value drivers as Buffett has done with GEICO The bonuses received by dozens of top executives starting with Tony are based upon only two key vari ables 1 growth in voluntary auto policies and 2 underwriting profitability on seasoned auto business meaning policies that have been on the books for more than one year2 How does Buffett ensure that he gets the incentives right for his managers so that they send all their excess capital to Berkshire Hathaway headquarters He does this by linking it directly to their compensation and to areas under their control In setting compensation we like to hold out the promise of large carrots but make sure their delivery is tied directly to results in the area that a manager controls When capital invested in an operation is significant we also both charge managers a high rate for in cremental capital they employ and credit them at an equally high rate for capital they release The product of this moneysnotfree approach is definitely visible at Scott Fetzer If Ralph can employ incremental funds at good returns it pays him to do so His bonus increases when earnings on additional capital exceed a meaningful hurdle charge But our bonus calculation is symmetrical If incremental investment yields substandard returns the shortfall is costly to Ralph as well as to Berkshire The consequence of this twoway arrangement is that it pays Ralphand pays him wellto send to Omaha any cash he cant advantageously use in his business Skin in the Game A system is responsible in proportion to the degree that the people who make the decisions bear the consequences Charles Frankel An example of a really responsible system is the system the Romans used when they built an arch The guy who created the arch stood under it as the scaffolding was removed Its like packing your own parachute Charlie Munger The presence of misaligned incentives results in perverse outcomes But when you align incentives of everyone in both positive and negative ways you create a system that takes care of itself Thinking about the incentives of others is necessary to creating winwin rela tionships Munger often says that people respond most strongly to what they view as their incentive or disincentive Nassim Taleb consid ers incentives and disincentives a better risk management tool than popular statistical methods like value at risk Incentives encourage desirable behavior Disincentives prevent them Almost four thousand years ago King Hammurabi of Babylon laid out one of the first sets of laws The Code of Hammurabi is among the oldest translated writings and consists of 282 laws most of them concerning punishment Taleb and George A Martin describe law 229 of Hammurabis Code as the best risk management rule The Hammurabi rule marks the separation between an agents interests and those of the client or principal she is supposed to rep resent This is called the agency problem in the social sciences Often closely associated is the problem of moral hazard wherein an actor has incentive to behave in an economically or socially suboptimal manner eg overly risky because she does not bear all of the actual andor potential costs of her action The Hammurabi rule solves the joint agency and moral hazard problem by ensur ing that the agent has sufficient nondiversifiable risk to incent the agent to act in the joint interest of the agent and the principal This moral principle is exactly what Seth Klarman refers to in his book Margin of Safety You probably would not choose to dine at a restaurant whose chef always ate elsewhere You should be no more satisfied with a money manager who does not eat his or her own cooking It is worth noting that few institutional money managers invest their own money along with their clients funds The failure to do so frees these managers to singlemindedly pursue their firms rather than their clients best interests1 Misaligned Incentives Often Result in Perverse Outcomes Early in the history of Xerox Joe Wilson who was then in the government had to go back to Xerox because he couldnt understand how their better new machine was selling so poorly in relation to their older and inferior machine Of course when he got there he found out that the commission arrangement with the salesmen gave a tremendous incentive to the inferior machine Charlie Munger In most cases complexity favors the seller simplicity the buyer Any product with a fat commission will get pushed no matter how toxic it is for the customer Munger says Any time you create large differences in commissions where the guy gets X for selling A which is some mundane security and 10 times X for selling B which is something toxic you know whats going to happen Incentivecaused bias is so pervasive that it occurs in almost every profession Outsider CEOs as opposed to founders in public companies avoid longterm valuecreating investments and research and development because their compensation is based on their meeting or beating quarterly street expectations Lawyers make clients litigate more than necessary Doctors prescribe expensive branded drugs instead of generics Contractors engage in the gaming of costplus arrangements Auditors overlook accounting irregularities Credit rating agencies give high ratings to junkgrade instruments Investment bankers price initial public offerings IPOs to extract max imum value for their clients because that is the basis on which they get paid The real power of incentives is the ability to manipulate the cognitive process An otherwisedecent individual may act immorally because he or she is driven by the perverse incentives prevailing in the system When you work in a job for someone else you could face the same problem Because incentivecaused bias operates automatically at a subconscious level you may be fooled into believing that what is good for you is also good for the client And so you may find yourself selling addictive and harmful products like tobacco and alco hol or overpriced and salesloadheavy insurance and investment products just for the money It is difficult to get rich on a salary because you get paid linearly for analyzing and solving a given problem in a job But you get paid in an exponential manner for spotting and seizing opportunities as an investor venture capitalist or entrepreneur As investors we can intelligently use the power of incentives to our advantage by recognizing certain subtle clues in the public markets For example if the existing private equity partners are not selling any stake during an IPO or the promoter purchases shares from the open market just ahead of the closure of the trading window before the quarterly results we should sit up and take notice If a pro moter announces a rights issue at an unattractive price it could be because he is aware of the strong growth prospects ahead and wants to deliberately discourage participation by minority shareholders and increase his ownership in the firm Significant insider ownership in entrepreneurbacked companies helps align the incentives of the promoter with those of the minority shareholders One should prefer situations in which the promoter has his or her entire skin in the game in just one company rather than owning multiple listed or pri vately held entities Never Ask the Barber Whether You Need a Haircut Widespread incentivecaused bias requires that one should often distrust or take with a grain of salt the advice of ones professional advisor even if he is an engineer The general antidotes here are 1 especially fear professional advice when it is especially good for the advisor 2 learn and use the basic elements of your advisors trade as you deal with your advisor and 3 double check disbelieve or re place much of what youre told to the degree that seems appropriate after objective thought Charlie Munger all commissioned salesmen said Munger at the 1988 Wesco Financial annual meeting have a tendency to serve the transaction instead of the truth Munger recommends that we should always reflect on the question What is someone getting out of this The more the managers and brokers take the less the investors make As Buffett says For investors as a whole returns decrease as motion increases2 Investors get what they dont pay for Many investment advisers are actually disguised brokers or subbrokers mutual fund distributors and insurance policy sellers whose objective is to maximize commissions and brokerage Ensure that your adviser is fee only receiving no remuneration from any source other than you The fund management industry is meant to be a fiduciary business but many money managers conduct their affairs as a marketing firm selling investments in the guise of an investment firm Learn to distinguish between the two Amarketing firm overly advertises the track records of its hottest funds An investment firm does not Amarketing firm creates new sector funds based on the latest fadsbecause they can sell them not because they think they are good investments for clients An investment firm does not Amarketing firm churns out incubator funds shuts down and buries those that do not perform well and does mass advertising of the ones that survive An investment firm does not An investment firm continually engages in client education on market volatility and explains how past performance is not repre sentative of the future A marketing firm does not Asmall and midcaporiented investment

firm does not An investment firm passes on to clients its savings benefits in the form of reduced fees when its operating cost ratios improve with increasing assets under management A marketing firm does not If investment firms focus on generating the best possible riskadjusted returns and maintain an ongoing dialogue with clients regarding their process and philosophy in a clear manner the rest

POUVERNG GEAL VawWEe Figure 161 a Simplicity drives value and b delivering value to clients ensures longterm survival and prosperity Source Behavior Gap Ultimately the best way to overcome incentivecaused bias is to achieve financial independence because this independence em powers you to see things as they really are Only free people can be honest Only honest people can be free Buffett captured the superpower of incentives in its full essence when he said I could end the deficit in five minutes You just pass a law that says that any time theres a deficit of more than 3 percent of GDP all sitting members of Congress are ineligible for reelection2 Thave nothing to add CHAPTER 17 ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THE MATH BUT AVOID PHYSICS ENVY Investing in stocks is an art not a science and people whove been trained to rigidly quantify everything have a big disadvantage Peter Lynch ath helps us evaluate when things make sense And math is stable over time It was true that two plus two equals four one mil lion years ago and it will be true one million years from today When we quantify and translate something into numeric form we can make relevant comparisons and sound judgment calls by heeding the wise words of John Maynard Keynes It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong At the height of the Internet bubble at the turn of the century Warren Buffett embodied Keyness wisdom When we buy a stock we always think in terms of buying the whole enterprise because it enables us to think as businessmen rather than stock speculators So lets just take a company that has marvelous prospects that is paying you nothing now where you buy it at a valuation of 500 billion To deliver lets assume that theres only going to be a oneyear delay before the business starts paying out to you and you want to get a 10 percent return If you paid 500 billion then 55 billion in cash is the amount that its going to have to be able to disgorge to you year after year To do that it has to make perhaps 80 billion or close to it pretax Look around the universe of businesses in this world and see how many are earning 80 billion pretax or 70 billion or 60 or 50 or 40 or even 30 billion You wont find any Note how Buffett uses extreme reductionism and proof by contradiction to greatly simplify an investing decision As investors we do not need to endlessly strive for precision Just being approximately right while having a good margin of safety is sufficient to get the job done Remember you dont need a weighing scale to know that a fourhundredpound man is fat Dont obsess over whether the business will earn 2 or 205 in the next quarter Focus instead on finding a big gap between the current price and the value you have placed on longterm earning power using conservative estimates to create a large margin of safety just in case your initial assessment is wrong But dont invest in a situation in which a complicated financial model is required to justify a purchase Keep things simple Buffett thought PetroChina was worth 100 billion and he could buy it at 37 billion You can engage in all sorts of elaborate analysis but Buffett boils down everything to whether a big discrepancy exists between the current price and the estimated value using conservative estimates which gives him a large margin of safety Dont overweigh what can be counted and underweigh what cannot Be wary of clinging to false precision in a complex world Not everything that counts can be counted and not everything that can be counted counts albert Einstein In his 2003 speech at the University of California Santa Barbara Economics Department titled Academic Economics Strengths and Faults After Considering Interdisciplinary Needs Charlie Munger said Youve got a complex system and it spews out a lot of wonderful numbers that enable you to measure some factors But there are other factors that are terribly important yet theres no precise numbering you can put to these factors You know theyre important but you dont have the numbers Well practically everybody 1 overweighs the stuff that can be numbered because it yields to the statistical techniques theyre taught in academia and 2 doesnt mix in the hardtomeasure stuff that may be more important em phasis added 2 When it comes to investing precision has much less practical application than an investor would think This tendency to look for precision where none exists is a human bias and is referred to by Munger in the same speech as physics envy In Poor Charlies Almanack Peter Kaufman writes Charlie strives to reduce complex situations to their most basic unemotional fundamentals Yet within this pursuit of rationality and simplicity he is careful to avoid what he calls physics envy the common human craving to reduce enormously complex systems such as those in economics to onesizefitsall Newtonian formulas Instead he faithfully honors Albert Einsteins admo nition A scientific theory should be as simple as possible but no simpler Or in his own words What Im against is being very confident and feeling that you know for sure that your particular action will do more good than harm Youre dealing with highly complex systems wherein everything is interacting with everything else2 A monumental example of this problem is the efficient market theory which assumes all market participants to be Homo economi cus or Economic Human ie perfectly rational beings at least according to the economic definition This theory is the outcome of trying to impose the discipline of a hard science on economics which actually is not a hard scienceit is a social science Markets are all about human behavior and while they are efficient at aggregating information and valuing data they certainly are not rational They are too complex and reactive to lend themselves to the kind of discipline that rules the hard sciences Discontinuity far from being an anomaly best ignored is an essential ingredient of markets that sets finance apart from the natural sciences According to Michael Mauboussin Acomplex adaptive system has three characteristics The first is that the system consists of a number of heterogeneous agents and each of those agents makes decisions about how to behave The most important dimension here is that those decisions will evolve over time The second characteristic is that the agents interact with one another That interaction leads to the thirdsomething that scientists call emergence In a very real way the whole becomes greater than the sum of the parts The key issue is that you cant really understand the whole system by simply looking at its individual parts When you see something occur in a complex adaptive system your mind is going to create a narrative to explain what hap penedeven though cause and effect are not comprehensible in that kind of system Hindsights a beautiful thing Complexity doesnt lend itself to tidy mathematics in the way that some traditional linear financial models do emphasis Value investors commonly joke that more fiction has been created using Excel than Word Because of deeply ingrained confirmation bias we do not need a spreadsheet to provide us with a goal seek function This function is embedded in our brains Personally Ihave never opened a spreadsheet even once when making an investment decision The most advanced technology I have ever used is a pocket calculator for basic math like addition subtraction multiplication and division Extensive spreadsheets and complex quantitative software tools can be harmful to ones financial wellbeing Tiny changes in input assumptions can dramatically change the estimate of intrinsic value so bankers and deal consultants can engage in any level of wishful reverseengineering that they deem convenient A discounted cash flow model remains the best strategic destination for all analysts where their imagination of pricetoearnings pricetobook and pricetosales ratios or enterprise value multiples failed to reach As Ben jamin Graham said The combination of precise formulae with highly imprecise assumptions can be used to establish or rather to justify practically any value one wishes Never underestimate the power of incentives The world cannot be understood without numbers At the same time it cannot be understood with numbers alone Relying solely on complex quantitative analysis can divert our attention away from things that really matter For example spreadsheets cannot model trust integrity goodwill reputation or the execution capabilities of the management Thus due diligence always needs to have a softer subjective side to it Investing is part art and part science Nuanced judgment is required Buffett says Price is what you pay Value is what you get So we have to ensure that we do not pay more than the intrinsic value of a company Now this poses a challenge We have to compare the price which can be measured precisely with an inherently imprecise estimate of value Most investors attempt to do just thatthey try to arrive at a precise number for intrinsic value For instance exact price targets in an analyst report right down to the last decimal point is a misleading anchor to cling to because the preciseness of the target price number instills a false sense of confidence in readers And this false confidence makes readers vulnerable to serious mistakes Its a classic case of physics envy in action Over the years I have come to appreciate the fact that investing is a field of simplifications and approximations rather than of extreme precision and quantitative wizardry I also have realized that investing is less a field of finance and more a field of human behav ior The key to investing success is not how much you know but how you behave Your behavior will matter far more than your fees your asset allocation or your analytical abilities Even lowcost index funds wont be able to help you if you succumb to behavioral biases Most of the time the real risk is not in the markets but in our behavior Emotional intelligence has a much bigger impact on the success or fail ure of investors than the college they attended or the complexity of their investment strategy Most of the time their high intellect works against them because they become so sure of themselves and their abilities that they cannot change their mind It is always a struggle to keep things simple in a complex world That struggle is more pronounced for the highly educated people The smarter you are the better you are at constructing a narrative that supports your personal beliefs rationalizing and framing the data to fit your argument or point of view You may be smart but not necessarily intelligent because intelligence is the ability to arrive at accurate causeandeffect descrip tions of reality Buffett has often said that the calculation of intrinsic value is a challenge In the Berkshire owners manual he said The calculation of intrinsic value though is not so simple As our definition suggests intrinsic value is an estimate rather than a precise figure and it is additionally an estimate that must be changed if interest rates move or forecasts of future cash flows are revised emphasis added 7 In his 2005 letter to investors Buffett wrote Calculations of intrinsic value though allimportant are necessarily imprecise and often seriously wrong The more uncertain the future of a business the more possibility there is that the calculation will be wildly offbase em phasis added And in his 2000 letter he wrote Using precise numbers is in fact foolish working with a range of possibilities is the better approach emphasis added As investors we can use simple approximations under a range of different business scenarios to estimate our potential return from any single stock and then compare this with the expected return from existing passive instruments and from the alternative choices in our stocks opportunity set to select the one with the highest expected return Thinking Forward and Backward Whenever we try to solve problems and predict what is likely to happen or is likely to be true or false we should think things through both forward and backwards Here are some of Mungers thoughts on the subject Think forwards and backwardsinvert always invert Many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backward The way complex adaptive systems work and the way mental constructs work is that problems frequently get easier Id even say usually are easier to solve if you turn them around in reverse In his enlightening talk in July 1996 titled Practical Thought on Practical Thought Munger took up a case involving the turning of 2 million into 2 trillion in 150 years Note Numerical fluency helps a lot when working with big numbers In this case the seemingly huge 2 trillion figure translates into a compound annual growth rate of 964 percent Compounding even at modest rates when done over a long period of time produces truly spectacular outcomes Although many great lessons can be gleaned from the transcript of this talk the big idea that I took away was the fact that Munger does not think in terms of intrinsic value today which is an imprecise number and often triggers a hornets nest of debates regarding the discount rate to be used for valuing future earnings or the perpetual growth rate also known in finance parlance as terminal growth rate to use at the end of the explicit forecasting period The latter is a critical point of contention today when the longevity of businesses across industries is shrinking rapidly because of technological disruptions and the very concept of terminal value which traditionally accounted for more than half the estimated intrinsic value of a business is being questioned An accelerating pattern of value migration is taking place away from outmoded business designs toward new designs that better satisfy customers most important priorities History suggests that many companies eventually will end up with a terminal value of zero Always be conservative when making assumptions about terminal value In his talk Munger teaches us how to think about arriving at a potential future value that we then can compare with the businesss current market value to calculate expected return In this case we are forced to think in terms of the math implicit in our assumptions while arriving at potential future value This method is popularly known in finance parlance as conducting a reverse discounted cash flow operation As you can see inversion helps solve many problems in life Lets take a simple hypothetical example to explain this process Lets say we want to buy shares of Company X whose current market value is 1 billion For the sake of simplicity we assume that there are no dividends stock options debt or offbalancesheet obli gations The business has owner earnings of 40 million and an assumed average annual growth rate of 10 percent for ten years the ex plicit forecasting period in this example This leads to a value of 104 million in owner earnings in year 10 Lets assume that the market pays an average multiple of 15x on owner earnings for this type of business and that no valuation rerating or derating of the business occurs in the interim period This gives us a market value of 156 billion in year 10 Compared with the current market value of 1 billion this gives us an implied yearly return of 45 percent Now simply compare this with the expected returns from the other investment opportunities available to you If the expected return over the next ten years is not even equal to the yield on the toprated sovereign bond then it would be irrational to own this stock at the current price A business may have great economic characteristics but if the expected returns are greatly inferior when compared with existing alternatives investors should avoid it Suppose we want to know under what scenario we could earn a 15 percent annual return from this stock What assumptions would be required to hold true to achieve thisand more important are they reasonable Apresent market value of 1 billion and an annual return of 15 percent leads to 4 billion in market value in year 10 An exit multiple of 15x suggests owner earnings of 270 million in year 10 This implies an average annual growth rate of 21 percent in owner earnings on the initial starting point of 40 million A hypothetical profit margin of 15 percent suggests sales of 18 billion in year 10 This implies a 21 percent annual growth rate in sales for ten years Now we can work with the various assumptions regarding required sales volume growth trends in sales realization per unit market share and so on and we can assess whether these are reasonable given the past trends and track record of volume growth pricing power profit margins market size market share and competitive advantage We also can find out which factor has the greatest impact on future owner earnings and thereby value and under what circumstances it could change We then could engage accordingly in a constructive premortem exercise To build in multiple redundancies to act as sources of margin of safety we should always use conservative assumptions We should avoid assuming future growth rates significantly in excess of historical growth rates both long term and short term use a reasonable exit multiple at the end of the explicit forecasting period and apply the method only on stable business models The inherent advantages of thinking in terms of longterm expected return instead of a precise current intrinsic value are multi fold This approach forces the mind to think about future value drivers It helps us determine the appropriate position sizing through an objective comparison of the competing investment alternatives available within our circle of competence It helps us select only simple businesses whose future is relatively more predictable We cannot apply this model to fastmoving technology businesses but we can apply it to moated businesses that meet basic human needs and aspirations in a relatively unsaturated market with a long runway for growth These businesses usually experience a slower rate of change in their business models The essence of this chapter is best summed up by Mungers words at the 1990 Berkshire annual meeting We never sit down run the numbers out and discount them back to net present value The decision should be obvious emphasis added2 CHAPTER 18 INTELLIGENT INVESTING IS ALL ABOUT UNDERSTANDING INTRINSIC VALUE A general definition of intrinsic value would be that value which is justified by the factseg assets earnings dividends definite prospects In the usual case the most important single factor determining value is now held to be the indicated average future earning power emphasis added Intrinsic value would then be found by first estimating this earning power and then multiplying that estimate by an appropriate capitalization factor Benjamin Graham Security Analysis he process of determining the intrinsic value of a business is an art form You cannot follow rigid rules to plug data into a spread sheet and hope that it spits out the value for you Stocks are worth what people are willing to pay for them and no shortcuts will give you an exact equilibrium value Intrinsic value is a moving target that is constantly changing as fundamental data come out and investors update their expectations based on knowledge and past experience In the past Warren Buffett has described intrinsic value as private owner value the price that an informed buyer would pay for the entire business and its future stream of cash Thus the intrinsic value of an asset is the sum of the cash flows expected to be received from that asset over its remaining useful life discounted for the time value of money and the uncertainty of receiving those cash flows If we carefully read Benjamin Grahams definition at the beginning of this chapter it is interesting to note that he says that future earning power is the most important single factor determining value So the main question we are trying to answer is this What is the normalized earning power of the business In other words if1am a private buyer how much cash will this business put in my pocket each year after paying for the expenditures required to maintain my competitive position What normalized owner earnings can I expect from this business Its Owner Earnings That Count Buffett defined owner earnings in his 1986 letter as follows a reported earnings plus b depreciation depletion amortization and certain other noncash chargesless c the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment etc that the business requires to fully maintain its longterm competitive position and its unit volume If the business requires additional working capital to maintain its competitive position and unit volume the increment also should be included in c On Wall Street the term earnings refers to net income or earnings per share EPS from the income statement This is what most analysts latch onto and they succumb to availability bias They fail to heed Charlie Mungers warning There is nothing more dangerous than an idea if its the only one you have Another widely used metric is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization EBITDA which although a ubiquitous term on Wall Street is a relatively new financial concept It was not until the leveraged buyout boom in the 1980s that EBITDA was widely adopted as a financial measure EBITDA however does not take into account real cash ex penses like capital expenditure capex interest and taxes For value investors the earnings used for valuation purposes are the owner earnings Net income and EPS are reported figures under accounting principles but the actual cash that the business owner is able to finally take out is quite different Owner earnings tell us how much cash comes into the business owners pockets which is meant to be actual spendable cash not inventory and receivables This is why Buffett calls it owner earnings Remember buying a stock is buying a part ownership in a business Buffetts definition of owner earnings is widely regarded in the value investing community as the holy grail for understanding the true earning power of a company Note however the subtle omission in Buffetts definition Buffett started from reported earnings and then made some adjustments to arrive at owner earnings But he did not adjust for out lays having a quasicapex nature such as advertising or research and development which are generally treated as an expense in the profit and loss PL statement before reported earnings are arrived at So the first variable reported earnings in Buffetts equation is likely to be depressed in cases of businesses with emerging moats that is businesses that are investing in longterm valuecreating initiatives that currently are being expensed in the income statement Investors should capitalize these types of expenditures and amortize them over a conservatively assumed economic life Two conditions must be satisfied to warrant such an adjustment volume growth and market share gains Business analysts should treat any money spent that expands the size of the moat as an expenditure that delivers an enduring advantagejust like capex Businesses that follow conservative accounting however treat all this money spent as an expense in the income statement Such an adjustment if made willin growing businesses in which such expenditures also are growingresult in owner earnings exceeding reported earnings This is why accounting numbers should always be used only as a basic starting point for investment analysis In moated businesses where money is being spent on expanding the moat and where this adjustment is made the correct number to use for determining intrinsic value is the owner earnings or economic earnings number Discount that number back from the future to arrive at fair value Many times conventional valuation measures based on reported earnings or accounting book values result in an optically high pricetoearnings or pricetobook ratio for a moated business and investors end up making costly mistakes of omission because they find these businesses to be overvalued But as Buffett has said Whether appropriate or not the term value investing is widely used Typically it connotes the purchase of stocks having attributes such as a low ratio of price to book value a low priceearnings ratio or a high dividend yield Unfortunately such charac teristics even if they appear in combination are far from determinative as to whether an investor is indeed buying something for what it is worth and is therefore truly operating on the principle of obtaining value in his investments Correspondingly opposite characteristicsa high ratio of price to book value a high priceearnings ratio and a low dividend yieldare in no way inconsistent with a value purchase emphasis added2 The key point is that for businesses that will grow their earnings even at a moderate pace but for a very long time the optically high pricetoearnings PE multiples that deter many value investors in reality are pretty low This means that if you buy a strong moated business at what appears to be a full price based on current year earnings you will end up compounding your money at a higher rate than the discount rate you used to arrive at that fair price The longer the competitive advantage period CAP the more likely a business is worth a lot more than what the market thinks Durability of the moat is the key factor The market tends to underappreciate compa nies that have really strong moats because the durability often allows for the companys runway to last longer than many expect For long term investing the focus should be shifted from entry PE multiples to duration of the CAP And PE multiples should be the result of the valuation exercise and not the cause Evaluating accounting numbers from the right perspective is vital to succeeding as an investor For example goodwill can reflect either having paid too much for an acquisition or enduring longterm intangibles whose value increases over time Investors will have to figure this out because the accountants wont With that in mind let us evaluate some of the important components of economic earnings namely maintenance capex and working capital My observation has been that the market always displays its wisdom and accords a lower valuation to companies with higher main tenance capex which thus optically appear to be cheaper than their peers One needs to derive the maintenance capex figure from the annual report or get it from management during the conference calls or annual general meetings Always crosscheck what management says with what they actually report Total capex is given in the investing section of the cash flow statement All capex that is not growth capex must necessarily be maintenance capex So if we can estimate growth capex we can estimate maintenance capex Sometimes it is obvious that almost all the capex is maintenance capex because of competitive pressures For example the functional equivalents of Buffetts shutdown of his textile mills are common in the business world so do not take the accountants definition of capex at face value Accountants dont evaluate they record transactions They would rather show something as precise even if it is wrong How a business transaction is recorded does not alter the event or its impact on value Avoid availability bias by asking Is this expenditure likely to result ina sustainable rise in economic earnings in the future This will not be the case if the margin or productivity gains have to be fully passed on to the customer if capex is incurred to replace defunct machinery that will only help the company maintain its current earning power if the industry is characterized by cutthroat com petition or high rates of technological change or obsolescence that requires constant capex for protective reasons or just to keep up with the competition which keeps inventing new technology applications thus making old technology obsolete or if historical cost account ing during highly inflationary periods results in underprovision of depreciation in the books In all of these cases the company in question makes no real profits When we correctly treat the money spent on such frequent capex programs not as capex but as maintenance capex we will figure out that essentially there are no owner earnings And when there are no owner earnings there is no value This will always hold true even if the stock market value of such a business in the interim period touches billions of dollars During such periods the Keynesian beauty contest phenomenon is in force with the investing public pricing shares based not on what they think their fundamental value is but rather on what they think everyone else thinks their value is or on what everybody else would predict the average assessment of value to be This is a common phenomenon during sector or assetclassspecific bubbles Bubbles are more of a social phenomenon than an economic or financial one People crave the shared experience of being part of something exciting and new The origin of these bubbles usually is grounded in a sound premise that eventually is overextended and taken too far In other words the essence of every bubble is strong fundamentalseuphorically extrapolated Graham used to talk about how ideas that initially were sound eventually were carried too far on Wall Street You can get in way more trouble with a good idea than a bad idea because you forget that the good idea has limits Buffett explains how certain assetheavy businesses with no owner earnings get into trouble when they begin to distribute out of restricted earnings Allearnings are not created equal In many businessesparticularly those that have high assetprofit ratiosinflation causes some orall of the reported earnings to become ersatz The ersatz portionlets call these earnings restricted cannot if the business is to retain its economic position be distributed as dividends Were these earnings to be paid out the business would lose ground in one or more of the following areas its ability to maintain its unit volume of sales its longterm competitive position its financial strength No matter how conservative its payout ratio a company that consistently distributes restricted earnings is destined for oblivion unless equity capital is otherwise infused Restricted earnings are seldom valueless to owners but they often must be discounted heavily In these kind of companies debt issuance and equity dilution occur frequently New investors keep pouring money into the firm but are never able to take anything out And if any dividends are paid they come not from operating cash flow but from the fresh fund infusions made by debt and equity investors These companies are just recycling cash from new investors to old investors which is the functional equivalent of a Ponzi scheme In Berkshires fiftieth annual letter Buffett described these kind of companies Business models based on the serial issuances of overpriced sharesjust like chainletter modelsmost assuredly redistribute wealth but in no way create it Both phenomena nevertheless periodically blossom in our countrythey are every promoters dreamthough often they appear in a carefully crafted disguise The ending is always the same Money flows from the gullible to the fraudster And with stocks unlike chain letters the sums hijacked can be staggering At both BPL and Berkshire we have never invested in companies that are hellbent on issuing shares That behavior is one of the surest indicators of a promotionminded management weak accounting a stock that is overpriced andall too oftenoutright dishon esty emphasis added Munger also has voiced his opinion on such businesses Benjamin Graham used to talk about a frozen corporationa company whose charter prohibited it from ever paying out anything to its owners or ever being liquidated or sold And Grahams question was What is such an enterprise worth Ido think that its an interesting case because I think there is a class of business where the eventual cash back part of the equation tends to be an illusion There are businesses like thatwhere you just constantly keep pouring it in and pouring it in but where no cash ever comes back emphasis added The working capital component in the owner earnings definition is an important input in the valuation exercise Any time a busi ness requires additional capital fixed or working that will do nothing for rise in unit volume or market share the money spent should be treated as an expense When competitive conditions deteriorate such required expenditures always go up This increase is usually a warn ing signal of things to come If bargaining power is permanently shifting from a business to its customers or suppliers then the amount of working capital needed by the business just to stand its ground in terms of unit volume and competitive position will increase That in crease is c in Buffetts equation and should be treated as a charge against earnings Of course when we do that in practice then in many cases we will find that c exceeds a b which means that there are no real earnings to speak of And if there are no real earnings then there is no real value although the asset in question may enjoy fabulous mar ket value for a while As Buffett notes Value is destroyed not created by any business that loses money over its lifetime no matter how high its interim valuation may get2 He closed his textile operations when he figured out that there were no owner earnings he refused to throw good money after bad In Security Analysis Graham contrary to popular belief actually spends a lot of time discussing future earningsnot what the busi ness earned in the past but rather what we can expect the business to earn each year on average in the future Graham was signaling that valuation is an art form Determining the present value of all the future cash flows of a business involves looking at the various aspects of a businesss DNA including its capital intensity business model durability balance sheet strength profitability competitive position future growth prospects and management bandwidth among other factorsall weighted and compared with the current price Some businesses are easier to value than others Predictability of cash flows is an important factor Graham talked about this when he said that the security analyst must use good judgment in distinguishing between securities and situations that are better suited and those that are worse suited to value analysis Its working assumption is that the past record affords at least a rough guide to the future The more ques tionable this assumption the less valuable is the analysis In other words it is easier to value a business with stable operations and cash flows than a business with high volatility in its under lying operations every year The intrinsic value is the sum of the present value of the cash flows during the explicit forecasting period and the present value of the terminal value Less predictable cash flows need to be discounted at a higher rate This leads us to the discussion regarding the appropriate starting point for the costofcapital number Both Buffett and Munger acknowledge that calculating a companys cost of capital is an inexact art that does not result ina precise estimate This is reflected in their comments during the 2003 annual meeting Buffett Charlie and I dont know our cost of capital Its taught at business schools but were skeptical We just look to do the most intelligent thing we can with the capital that we have We measure everything against our alternatives Ive never seen a cost of capital calculation that made sense to me Have you Charlie Munger Never If you take the best text in economics by Mankiw he says intelligent people make decisions based on opportunity costsin other words its your alternatives that matter Thats how we make all of our decisions The rest of the world has gone off on some kicktheres even a cost of equity capital A perfectly amazing mental malfunction2 Taking a cue from Buffett and Munger the SP 500s longterm annual return of 97 percent during the twentieth century can be taken as a reasonably good proxy for an investors longterm opportunity cost Professor Bruce Greenwald often instructs students in his value investing class to just use 10 percent It close enough and it makes the math easy2It is a reasonable assumption to use 10 percent as the starting estimate for the cost of capital when calculating a companys value Investors in countries outside the United States can use the longterm market returns of their respective countries as the starting point This can then be revised up or down depending on the individual companys risk characteristics The best outcome that an investor can hope to achieve when it comes to appraising business values is to come up with a range of values and then wait for the market to offer a price that is significantly below the lower end of the rangethis gives you both a margin of safety in the event your analysis is wrong and high returns on your investment if you are right If you can understand the business well it will be easy for you to quickly judge whether the stock is obviously cheap or obviously expensive based on a simple backofthenapkin calculation Security Analysis discussed the concept of a range of value The essential point is that security analysis does not seek to determine exactly what is the intrinsic value of a given security It needs only to establish that the value is adequateeg to protect a bond or to justify a stock purchaseor else that the value is consider ably higher or considerably lower than the market price For such purposes an indefinite and approximate measure of the intrinsic value may be sufficient emphasis added2 From this we can infer that Graham never intended for intrinsic value to be thought of as a single point estimate of value Rather he thought of it more as a concept of value In fact in the 1934 edition of Security Analysis Graham discusses the flexibility of the concept of intrinsic value as a very hypothetical range of approximate value which would grow wider as the uncertainty of the picture increased2 To deal with an inherently uncertain future an investor needs to consider various possible scenarios when forecasting a companys future cash flows and calculating its intrinsic value One could produce a range of potential intrinsic values by performing a sensitivity analysis in which the assumption about one or more of the future cash flow components varies over time Each scenario will produce a different discrete present value estimate that the investor can use to create a range of possible intrinsic values The values closest to the central point represent the estimates that the investor believes have the highest likelihood probability of being the companys true in trinsic value whereas the estimated values near each of the tails are the scenarios the investor believes are less likely to occur The range of possible intrinsic values grows wider as uncertainty increases A wide range of estimates may result from the fact that the timing dura tion magnitude or growth of the companys cash flows are highly uncertain When the range of possible outcomes is wide it is foolish to use scenario analysis and calculate estimates such as a base case x probability 60 percent b optimistic case x probability 10 percent and c pessimistic case x probability 30 percent and then come up with weighted average price of x for the stock That would be the functional equivalent of a sixfoottall man who cannot swim trying to cross a river that has an average depth of five feet He forgets that the range of depth is between four feet and twelve feetand he would drown Ignoring the range of possibilities is foolish In businesses like oil or any business that involves extracting stuff from below the earths surface that range can be huge Each businesss economics is different All earnings are not created equal Ten dollars of earnings from a capitallight business like Moodys with its low reinvestment requirements is obviously worth a lot more than the same earnings figure from a capitalintensive business like General Dynamics so investors should capitalize each of them differently Investors have to look at each businesss earning power along with the future prospects of the business to decide how much they are willing to pay to acquire that businesss future cash flows Many entrepreneurs recognize that wealth creation is not a zerosum game and that if they behave ethically their businesses will enjoy a much higher valuation multiple than would be the case if they didnt A high multiple stock does not just create a high valuation for the business it also provides the management with a wonderful tool to grow inorganically through acquisitions with lower equity di lution When A acquires B for stock it always means A is selling a stake in its business to acquire B Earnings are created by businesses but earnings multiples are created by markets Other things remaining unchanged a business that is run in the interests of all stakeholders is worth more than one that is run solely in the interests of the controlling stockholders Buffett has highlighted this important point in the past Investors should pay more for a business that is lodged in the hands of a manager with demonstrated proshareholder leanings than for one in the hands of a selfinterested manager marching to a different drammer2 Some Thoughts on Value Traps The traditional value investor mentality of buying cheap securities waiting for them to bounce back to intrinsic value selling and moving onto the next opportunity is flawed In todays world of instant information and fastpaced innovation cheap securities increasingly appear to be value traps often they are companies ailing from technological disruption and longterm decline This rapid recycling of capital also creates an enormous drag on our aftertax returns In addition by focusing on these opportunities we incur enormous opportunity costs by not focusing in stead on the tremendous opportunities created by the exceptional innovation Scurves we are currently witnessing Marcelo Lima Most of the time switching from a high PE stock to one with a low PE proves to be a mistake Value traps are abundant and allpervasive Thave learned to respect the markets wisdom Everything trades at the level it does for a reason High quality tends to trade at expensive valuation and junk or poor quality is frequently available at cheap or the harmful optically cheaper on a relative basis valuation It took me many years to learn this big market lesson expensive is expensive for a reason and cheap is cheap for a reason In the stock market prices usually move first and the reported fundamentals follow For instance for debt issued by listed com panies stock price behavior usually turns out to be a more accurate barometer for gauging the probability of default than ratings given by the credit rating agencies A plummeting stock price in an otherwise steady market often turns out to be an accurate harbinger of deteriorating fundamentals for a company Think about this before you jump in to buy Avoid investing in melting ice cubes What appears to be cheap or relatively inexpensive can continue becoming cheaper if industry headwinds intensify An irrational fall in price makes a stock cheaper A rational fall in price makes a stock more expensive Many of the high dividendyield stocks in expensive markets eventu ally turn out to be value traps and destroy wealth When you see a deep value stock suddenly break down on high volumes with no visible explanation take notice You are likely observing a value trap Value traps are businesses that look cheap but actually are expensive This could happen for a variety of reasons Cyclicality of earnings A low PE stock may look cheap because the business is enjoying cyclically peak earnings but the normal ized PE may not really be low if adjusted for cyclicality App risk A taxi company may look cheap based on past earning power but that may have existed only until Uber arrived Bad capital allocation by the management The market may correctly be punishing a business by assigning a low multiple to its earnings because the managers keep burning cash in bad projects and there is no prospect of such misallocation being stopped Governance issues A business run by a crook may appear to be quite cheap relative to the large amount of cash reported on its books until that cash is completely siphoned off Give zero valuation to the cash held in the books of a business being run for social purposes or owned by shady promoters Gains in intrinsic value often are not reflected in realized returns for investors because insiders channel the gains to themselves Remember human nature does not change Crooks dont suddenly sprout a sense of fiduciary duty Always keep Thomas Phelpss words in mind Remember that aman who will steal for you will steal from you Avoid partnering with such forms of management even if it comes at the cost of missing an opportunity The notional loss from not capitalizing on an opportunity can be made up any time but the eventual realized loss from partnering with a crook is permanent and irrecoverable CHAPTER 19 THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT WORDS IN INVESTING A margin of safety is achieved when securities are purchased at prices sufficiently below underlying value to allow for human error bad luck or extreme volatility in a complex unpredictable and rapidly changing world Seth Klarman e can learn some important lessons from the past about the likely future returns for investors who pay exorbitant valuations for todays hot stocks Let us dip into the past to canvass one moment of investor exuberance the era of the Nifty Fifty to see what the future may hold for todays current batch of high fliers For those unfamiliar with the era of the Nifty Fifty which reached its zenith in 1972 here is a description of the period by Professor Jeremy Siegel The Nifty Fifty were a group of premier growth stocks such as Xerox IBM Polaroid and CocaCola that became institutional darlings in the early 1970s All of these stocks had proven growth records continual increases in dividends virtually none had cut its dividend since World War II and high market capitalization This last characteristic enabled institutions to load up on these stocks without significantly influencing the price of their shares The Nifty Fifty were often called onedecision stocks buy and never sell Because their prospects were so bright many analysts claimed that the only direction they could go was up Since they had made so many rich few if any investors could fault a money manager for buying them At the time many investors did not seem to find 50 80 or even 100 times earnings at all an unreasonable price to pay for the worlds preeminent growth companies emphasis added Lawrence Hamtil of wealth management firm Fortune Financial calculated the returns of the expensive Nifty Fifty stocks over the next forty years beginning from June 1972 Table 191 shows his findings TaBLE 191 Returns of the Nifty Fifty beginning June 1972 Expensive Nifty

What You Pay Value Is What You GetNifty Fifty Edition Fortune Financial blog May 24 2018 httpwwwfortunefinancialadvisorscomblogpriceiswhatyoupayvalueiswhatyougetniftyfiftyedition According to Hamtil The lesson from this exercise I believe is that investors should always be conscious of starting valuation when placing their bets With few exceptions eventually valuations that are simply too high will drift back down to more reasonable levels often at the expense of poor intermediateterm performance This appears to be true no matter how revolutionary the new business appears to be and no matter how much potential you believe it has emphasis added Of course if your conviction is such that you plan on holding your shares for multiple decades valuation may indeed matter less to longterm returns but that is assuming you follow through on your commit ment Over several years of subpar performance that is much easier said than done2 All fast growers eventually turn into stalwarts or slow growers This painful transition can result in a lost decade for investors during which time valuation derating causes the stock to remain flat or to trade sideways Time and again the market teaches us that a big difference exists between a great company and a great stock For the investor a toohigh purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of fa vorable business developments Warren Buffett Iconceive that a great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value of things and by their giving too much for their whistles Benjamin Franklin At times the valuation of a stock we have held for a long time becomes so absurdly high that we should be able to sell it instantly without any hesitation or doubt But this type of sale is not mentally easy to execute because the valuation expansion would have been accompanied by huge gains for the investor leading to excessive greed and the subsequent tendency to debunk traditional measures of valuation Compounding at a moderate but steady rate of return over a long period of time is vastly superior to merely generating sharp out performance for a year or two Averages can be grossly misleading so we should always use a geometric progression and look at compound annual growth rate CAGR if we want to understand returns the right way An investor with 14 percent average annual return 20 per cent 40 percent 20 percent 50 percent and 40 percent over a fiveyear period underperforms someone with 9 percent average annual return if the latter is consistent every year As of February 2018 only 5 percent of the listed Indian companies with at least INR 10 crores US14 million of net profit grew earnings by more than 20 percent CAGR over the preceding ten years Against that 55 percent of the companies had an earnings decline Because earnings drive returns in the long term it just goes to show how difficult it is to compound wealth by more than 20 percent on a sustainable basis Achieving a CAGR of 100 percent for a few years is commendable but achieving a CAGR of 20 percent for six decades is what makes a Warren Buffett He played the game for the longest time and became the biggest winner Investing success is challenging over a long time period A bull market year or two in between fools many market participants into thinking otherwise It takes a fairly short time to learn how to make money but it takes a lifetime to learn how to not lose it A margin of safety in investing is necessary to avoid compounding in reverse A stable investor who earns 20 percent for two consecutive years comes out ahead of a flamboyant newcomer who earns 100 percent in a bull market year and loses 30 percent or more in the following year Most of the inexperienced investors realize this harsh math the painful way when junk stocks finally start crashing after a bull market and only then do they begin to appreciate the significant importance of investing in quality One single year of a big loss can undo all the hard work and sacrifices of the past Sample this If you generate 15 percent return per year for two years but lose 15 percent in year 3 your CAGR is only 40 percent If you make 15 percent per year for three years and then lose 15 percent in year 4 your CAGRis cut to 66 percent And if you earn 15 percent per year for four years but lose 15 percent in year 5 your CAGR is cut to 83 percent The difference becomes even more striking when considering larger absolute return figures If you generate 30 percent return per year for two years but lose 30 percent in year 3 your CAGRis only 58 percent If you make 30 percent per year for three years and then lose 30 percent in year 4 your CAGR is cut to 114 percent And if you earn 30 percent per year for four bull market years but lose 30 percent in year 5 your CAGRis cut to 149 percent Buffetts adaptation of margin of safety for the masses follows Rule number 1 Never lose money Rule number 2 Never forget rule number 1 When Brent Beshore asked Buffett about Berkshires due diligence process Buffett replied Price is my due diligence2 It was the clearest articulation of his investment philosophy Buffett is extremely patient and disciplined and does not take a swing of the bat if any deal cuts too close with regards to the price paid versus the value received Buffetts investment criterion is demanding He will not buy a security until he sees an ample margin of safety considered from multiple vantage points The opportunity needs to be simply incredible When you pay low entry prices you dont need many good things to happen for you to get a good return Even if some bad news comes out about the company because it already has been discounted the stock price impact is limited Conversely if any good news emerges you get a highly positive result There always seems to be a strong divide within the investing community between deep value statistically cheap securities and growth at a reasonable price highquality compounders It is true that many investors do well by buying great businesses at fair prices and holding them for long periods of time whereas other investors prefer to buy cheap stocks of average or mediocre quality and sell them when they appreciate to fair value repeating the process over time as they cycle through multiple new opportunities The styles are different but not as different as most people describe them to be The tactics used are different but the objective is exactly the samethat is trying to buy something for less than what its really worth or trying to locate the lowrisk fiftycent dollars Both strategies are just different versions of Grahams marginofsafety principle Quality Increases the Margin of Safety Over Time Ifyou plan to hold a share for the long term the rate of return on capital it generates and can reinvest at is far more important than the rating you buy or sell at Terry Smith The margin of safety can be derived from the gap between price and value and it also can be derived from the quality of the business For example a business that can grow intrinsic value at a rate of 18 percent annually is worth much more than a business that is growing its value at 6 percent annually all other things being equal Because the higherquality compounder is worth a lot more over a longterm holding period than the lowerquality business the former offers a larger margin of safety The problem with investing only in statistically cheap securities also known as cigar butts is that the underlying businesss economic value gradually erodes with each passing day making the investment a race against time As investors our goal should be to minimize the number of decisions and to reduce the potential for unforced errors It is much more productive to be invested in businesses with growing intrinsic value over time because it allows for a larger margin of error in case we are wrong and higher returns in case we are right Ina 1975 article in Financial Analysts Journal written by Charles D Ellis and titled The Losers Game Ellis talks about how the approach taken by good and bad tennis players is also seen in investing In the article Ellis cites a study done in a book called Extraordinary Tennis for the Ordinary Tennis Player written by Simon Ramo As the study showed and as Ellis wrote in his article Professionals win points amateurs lose points This point on amateur tennis is similar to how many investors invest Most wealth destruction happens as a result of unforced errors If investors focused on reducing unforced errors instead of trying to hit the next home run then their returns would improve dra matically It is like the amateur tennis champion who wins because he or she has made the fewest mistakes but not necessarily the most forehand wins In the view of Ellis investing like tennis is a losers game The winners in the game come out with superior longterm results simply by making fewer mistakes The losers end up with losses because they make the same mistakes repeatedly No one can avoid making new mistakes but the great investors repeat old mistakes less often The stock markets in aggregate have been a positivesum game over the long term With such a natural tailwind behind us investing for the long term is a winners game One way to reduce unforced errors in investing is to carefully choose the businesses that we decide to own Investors are better off with a few solid longterm choices than flitting from one speculation to another always chasing the latest hot stock in the market Better to have a few good longterm friends rather than changing your friends every week for shortterm advantage The gap between price and value ultimately will determine our returns but picking the right business is possibly the most important step in reducing errors Improving pattern recognition skills increases the probability of successfully identifying the right busi nesses to invest in Without doubt cigar butts as a category have the potential to outperform quality over a short holding period but over the long term companies with increasing intrinsic value over time are the clear winners On balance paying a high price for even a great business may not always work out well if you have to sell that business in one or two years But if you plan to hold your stocks for longer periods of timesay five years ten years or longerthen quality becomes much more important than cheap initial valuations when assessing margin of safety This leads to an important conclusion when investing in shortterm opportunities like commodities cyclicals and spe cial situations pay greater attention to price and mean reversion but when investing in longterm compounders pay maximum attention to the quality of business and management above all else For example buying a lowquality public sector bank in India at 30 percent to 40 percent of book value can work out well if and when the stock gets revalued to 100 percent of book value But over ten or fifteenyear periods or longer paying even three times book value for a highquality wellmanaged franchise like HDFC Bank should deliver better results Between two lenders with similar levels of return on equity and growth I would prefer the lender with a higher pricetobook valuation for two reasons 1 growth capital in the future would be available at a lower equity dilution and 2 a higher pricetobook valuation tends to signify important nondisclosed as pects like superior underwriting skills robust internal processes and better quality of the loan book Having started out as Grahamiteswhich by the way worked finewe gradually got what I would call better insights And we real ized that some company that was selling at 2 or 3 times book value could still be a hell of a bargain because of momentums implicit in its position sometimes combined with an unusual managerial skill plainly present in some individual or other or some system or other Charlie Munger For a Graham and Dodd investor the margin of safety comes from a low price relative to asset value or from a high earning power relative to a AAA bond yield There is less focus on the quality of the business or the management For a Warren BuffettCharlie Munger Phil Fisher investor the margin of safety comes from the ability of a business to deliver high returns on invested capital on a sustained basis over long periods of time which in turn comes from a durable competitive advantage created by exceptional managers at the helm These franchisefocused investors do not hesitate to pay up for quality in the form of an expensive multiple for current year earnings if they believe that the future earnings will be significantly higher The Graham and Dodd investor believes in mean reversionthat is bad things will happen to good businesses and good things will happen to bad businesses BuffettMungerFisher investors invest in businesses with fundamental momentum that is a high probability of sustaining excess returns over long periods of time These two ideologies often clash mean reversion versus fundamental momentum in the value investing community For most businesses mean reversion applies but for some exceptional ones it starts applying after a prolonged period of time and until then fundamental momentum applies Although Benjamin Graham is widely renowned as a deep value investor the profits from his single growth stock investment GEICO were more than all his other career investments combined In 1948 Grahams investment partnership GrahamNewman purchased 50 percent of GEICO for 712000 By 1972 this was worth 400 million Graham had scored a Peter Lynchian fivehundredbagger He later wrote Ironically enough the aggregate of profits accruing from this single investment decision far exceeded the sum of all the others realized through 20 years of wideranging operations in the partners specialized fields involving much investigation endless pondering and countless individual decisions Since stock markets typically value companies on the not unreasonable assumption that their returns will regress to the mean businesses whose returns do not do this can become undervalued Therein lies our opportunity as investors Fundsmith Equity Fund Owners Manual Ina June 2013 research paper by Credit Suisse the authors provided strong evidence supporting Buffetts philosophy of investing in successful companies with an established track record of delivering high owner earnings in relation to invested capital The authors used a proxy called cash flow return on investment They looked at hundreds of firms from around the world from 1993 to 2013 and at the beginning of each quarter starting from 1993 divided the universe into quartiles Q1 were firms in the poorest performance quartile and Q4 were the bestquality firms with the highest cash flow return on investment The researchers then determined the persistence or stickiness of cash flow return on investment by studying the historical transition between performance levels over succes sive fiveyear periods for each firm and came up with the findings detailed in table 192 TABLE 192 Transition Probability Ending Quartile Ql Q2 Q3 Q4 Starting Quartile Ql 56 27 ll 6 Q2 28 40 23 Q3 13

successive fiveyear periods These results tell us a few things 1 Operating performance is not random Had it been random all probabilities would have been closer to 25 percent We find little evidence of mean reversion Rp The bestperforming firms had a 51 percent probability of remaining among the bestperforming firms and the worstperforming firms had a 56 percent probability of remaining the poorest performers Great businesses tend to remain great or they become good businesses combined probability of 79 percent There was only a9 percent chance that a great business would end up in the quartile of poorest performers Poor businesses tend to remain poor or they become slightly better but still remain below average combined probability of 83 percent There was only a 6 percent chance that the weakest businesses would transition to the best performers category s The authors of the study Bryant Matthews and David Holland conclude with the following summary Corporate profitability is sticky Wonderful companies tend to remain wonderful and poor companies tend to remain stuck in the mud Our empirical evidence suggests that sustainable corporate turnarounds are difficult to execute Companies in defensive industries exhibit more stickiness in corporate profitability than firms in cyclical industries How ever the persistence in performance remains highly significant and thus the reputation of the business tends to remain intact re gardless of industry Firms with excellent profitability tend to outperform those with the worst return on capital The outperformance improves if high quality firms are purchased at a fair price emphasis added The key finding of this study was that despite being recognized as successful businesses the Q4 category businesses continued to deliver outstanding investment results over the long term But if markets were efficient this should not have happened The prices of such stocks should have been bid up to the point at which buyers could not earn exceptional returns But they did Markets systematically underprice quality over long time periods This has been proven empirically not just in this study but in many others Financial economist Robert NovyMarx looked at New York Stock Exchange firms between 1963 and 2010 and at international firms between 1990 and 2009 He found the same persistence of high performance not just in business fundamentals but also in stock market returns More profitable companies today tend to be more profitable companies tomorrow Although it gets reflected in their future stock prices the market systematically underestimates this today making their shares a relative bargaindiamonds in the rough Buffetts Evolution from Graham to Fisher Buffetts gradual transition from being a deep value investor to one willing to pay up for quality can be best understood by studying the evolution in his thought process over the years as expressed in the following quotes When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics it is the reputation of the business that remains intact2 My own thinking has changed drastically from 35 years ago when I was taught to favor tangible assets and to shun busi nesses whose value depended largely upon economic Goodwill This bias caused me to make many important business mistakes of omission although relatively few of commission Ultimately business experience direct and vicarious produced my present strong preference for businesses that possess large amounts of enduring Goodwill and that utilize a minimum of tangible assets2 Its far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price Charlie understood this early Iwas a slow learner But now when buying companies or common stocks we look for firstclass businesses accompanied by firstclass managements High quality always beats a bargain over time Although there are certainly exceptions in the long run bargains never outperform solid investments This simple yet profound principle can be applied to virtually every area of life Crash diets predatory pricing dishon esty and shortcuts can work well for a while but they are never sustainable CHAPTER 20 INVESTING IN COMMODITY AND CYCLICAL STOCKS 1S ALL ABOUT THE CAPITAL CYCLE The risk of paying too high a price for goodquality stockswhile a real oneis not the chief hazard confronting the average buyer of securities Observation over many years has taught us that the chief losses to investors come from the purchase of lowquality securities at times of favorable business conditions The purchasers view the current good earnings as equivalent to earning power and assume that prosperity is synonymous with safety emphasis added Benjamin Graham The Intelligent Investor n 1955 Benjamin Graham had to testify on the state of the stock market before the US Senate Committee on Banking and Currency The following excerpt is from an exchange between Graham and the committee chair Chair When you find a special situation and you decide just for illustration that you can buy for 10 and it is worth 30 and you take a position and then you cannot realize it until a lot of other people decide it is worth 30 how is that process brought aboutadvertising or what happens Graham That is one of the mysteries of our business and it is a mystery to me as well as to everybody else We know from experi ence that eventually the market catches up with value It realizes it in one way or another Grahams response to the question regarding an undervalued stock rising to a level of fair valuation captures the essence of the process of mean reversion But what causes this revaluation For that an understanding of the capital cycle is essential A capital cycle is based on the premise that the prospect of high returns will attract capital which results in intense competition just as low returns repel it The resulting ebb and flow of capital affects longterm returns for stockholders in what often are predictable waysthis is termed the capital cycle When investing in commodities and cyclicals look for industries that are in a major down cycle and are starved for capital This step should be followed by a detailed analysis of the fundamentals of individual companies and behavioral insights within the sector to uncover stocks that are selling at a significant discount to their intrinsic value Next conduct a stress test to check whether the short listed companies have manageable debt and are capable of surviving another couple of years in a downturn Then wait for a few compa nies in the industry to go bust or shut down some plants and initiate your buying activity after that happens while pessimism levels are high As the cycle starts turning add more to your position Given the contrarian and longterm nature of the capital cycle approach to investing this strategy entails firm variant perception and long holding periods Such a disciplined and patient deep value investing approach enables investors to achieve high riskadjusted re turns when the cycle eventually turns According to financial historian and investment strategist Edward Chancellor capital cycle investing is more profitable than strate gies based on growth or value orientation Chancellors book Capital Returns Investing Through the Capital Cycle captures the essence of the capital cycle approach to investing Capital Cycle Red Flags Even if we cannot actively monitor the changes in fixed assets in an industry we can still look for signals of a capital cyclerelated bubble Chancellor gives several examples of such red flags Watch what investment banks are doing Investment banks are the investors enemy Chancellor says2 Be wary of industries that are characterized by high levels of investment banking activities such as mergers and acquisitions initial public offerings IPOs and debt especially highyield issuance IPOs are a capital allocation decision that often represents a buildup of capac ity in a company or industry Chancellor says that the surge in junkbond issuance by US energy companies in 2016 was a sign that investors should have avoided the sector Beware of investor frenzy Early signs include thematic investor conferences and growing levels of industry coverage by analysts news channels business magazines and newspapers Look out for high levels of capital investment in an industry This is the most direct sign of a capital cycle that is about to harm investors Monitor metrics such as assets share count debt issuance the capital expendituretodepreciation ratio and profitability margins and return on capital Sharp growth in any of these metrics is a warning sign Chancellor says You dont need supply to increase to destroy returns capital expenditures will do it Carefully study the flow of capital into or out of an industry Investors often do not pay attention to this movement They simply extrapolate the demand based on recent experience and do not add up how much supply is coming on at the same time It is difficult to precisely forecast demand which is unknowable and given human nature the projections tend to err on the optimistic side Noted strategist Russell Napier has often remarked that analysts spend 90 percent of their time thinking about demand and only 10 percent thinking about the supply side even though supply in most industries can be forecasted accurately through a number of readily available hard metrics and it takes quite a while for new supply to come online In the introduction to his book Chancellor provides data to demonstrate the robustness of a capital cyclebased investment strat egy Citing research by Societe Generales Andrew Lapthorne Chancellor shows that annual returns of stocks from 1990 to 2015 have been nearly perfectly inversely correlated with asset growth The more companies invest in assets the worse the returns are for shareholders Academic research Chancellor writes is edging toward the conclusion that the excess returns historically observed from value stocks and the low returns from growth stocks are not independent of asset growth The key insight according to Chancellor is that when analyzing value versus growth it is necessary to take into account asset growth at both the company and the sectoral level He cites an academic paper that showed that the value effect disappears after controlling for capital investment What about investors who do not possess the required temperament to invest in and hold on to commodity and cyclical stocks during the prolonged period of a depressed cycle The cycle for certain commodities and cyclicals such as sugar graphite electrodes steel hotels and the like usually lasts for a longer time than the cycle for other commodities and cyclicals This gives investors sufficient time to enter a bit late and still make a lot of money during the remainder of the cycle Many times even after a big miss on earnings anda sharp cut in analyst estimates a commodity or cyclical stock actually goes up after bad earnings This is a typical sign of a company or industry bottoming outwhen the stocks no longer go down after companies report bad news Always remember Howard Markss two rules Rule number 1 Most things will prove to be cyclical Rule number 2 Some of the greatest opportunities for gain and loss come when other people forget rule number 12 The Significance of Empathy in the Investing Discipline Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another It is useful for investors to possess this trait Different market players are playing their game on the same field You just need to keep playing your own game regardless of the game others are playing Never confuse your time frame with someone elses A meaningful price level for a shortertimeframe participant is often an irrelevant figure to someone planning to hold longer term Empathy opens our minds to different points of view and reveals certain aspects that might have escaped our attention earlier In investing it refers to looking at a business from the point of view of an analyst a banker a value investor a customer a supplier and the society at large Stepping into others shoes enables us to analyze a situation in the appropriate context One of the best ways to gain an investing edge is by using our inherent capacity to empathize A stock chart can tell youa great deal about what its current holders may be feeling Think of a scenario with a price volume breakout on a stock from a longtime resistance of 150 that increases to 170 More trading volume means more new shareholders who are created with an average cost basis higher than the old resistance level These shareholders are going to be slow to sell if the stock drifts back down More trading volume also means that many of the older shareholders who had their average cost near the old resistance level sold at a profit They are likely to buy back the stock if its drifts lower Generally the stronger the original resistance level was the stronger the new support level will be Many people who bought at 150 and sold at 170 experience a positive outcome and they create a mental shortcut that associates buying the stock around 150 with a positive feeling Therefore 150 becomes a strong support level In fact at times this association becomes so deeprooted at the subconscious level that these investors end up ignoring facts like a deteriorating outlook for the companys fundamentals Over time as an active and highly engaged investor you develop what is known as a feel for the market If a group of stocks from a single industry are all rapidly going up together at the same time for a few successive days in a row then that isa strong signal that the for tunes of that industry may be turning around and should be investigated further This scenario is even more significant if it happens amid overly negative sentiment for the sector in question This is one of the best ways to identify inflection points in a sectoral trend that occur as an industrys fortunes are beginning to turn around Most of the time we observe that the stocks that are going up together so rapidly do not have any current earnings to support their valuations but we generally realize only in hindsight that the market was an extremely smart discounting machine It is why Gerald Loeb said The market is better at predicting the news than the news is at predicting the market Always respect the wisdom of the collective If a particular stock displays a price volume breakout to fiftytwoweekmultiyear alltime highs on large volumes then that stock is a strong candidate to start researching In technical analysis parlance if a stocks price rise is on low volumes it may be topping out and if the price remains rangebound on large volumes it implies a distribution is being made Chartists prefer a decrease in volume when a stock is in its consolidation phase Time frame is important All else being equal a stock that has broken out of a multiyear trading range is more promising than a stock that has broken out of a oneyear trading range In the case of the former many individuals who bought the stock years ago may have sold it a long time ago out of frustration and fewer people would be waiting to get back to breakeven and to sell the stock at higher levels Note that prices dont break out of a longterm range unless investors expectations have changed Someone is willing to pay a price that no one else has paid for a long time and this is usually a sign that something major has changed in the underlying fundamentals of the company Nothing is more heartwarming for an investor to see than a new high for a stock against the backdrop of a strong earnings report and improving fundamentals A stock going to a new high is typically a bullish event because the market has eliminated the supply of all previous buyers who experienced a loss and were waiting to get out at even A stock hitting a new high has no overhead supply to contend with and has much more of an open running field Everybody has a profit everybody is happy In contrast a stock near its fiftytwoweek low has a great deal of overhead supply to work through and lacks upside momentum because it is vulnerable to fresh bouts of selling by the old investors at every higher level TechnoFunda investors tend to believe in two key principles in addition to strong earnings growth and industry fundamentals when analyzing potential buys first stocks that show relative strength that is that go sideways or consolidate during significant market pullbacks tend to outperform significantly during the subsequent market recovery and second the first stocks that break out to new fiftytwoweek highs after or during a major correction tend to become the leaders of the next rally The beauty of the Internet and social media is that everyone has access to the best brains on the planet for a marginal cost The fiftytwoweek high list is often a shortcut to the minds of smart investors At any given time the market has only a few great growth stories but hundreds of institutions want to own them For these institutions its all about catching the next big thing and pricetoearnings ratios are a secondary consideration Trends persist because supply is limitedearly buyers are not eager to sell and plenty of new buyers would like to participate Theres always a scarcity of great growth stories and markets love high growth Even if you do not end up investing in any of the breakout stocks the positive takeaway from this exercise would be the fact that your mental database will have expanded by studying the annual reports presentations and conference call audio recordings and tran scripts of the various companies in the industry Conference calls are a vital component of any serious investors research activity list For truly passionate investors researching new companies is just delightful and never gets old The importance of insatiable intellectual curiosity along with a deep passion for continuous learning cannot be overstated in the investing profession In investing all knowledge is cumulative and the insights we acquire by putting in the effort today often help us ina serendipitous way at some time in the future Work hard today to let good luck find you tomorrow Opportunities in the stock market can spring to life on short notice To take advantage of them you must be prepared and ready to act Make sure you properly allocate your time playing offense as well as defense Playing defense means monitoring the companies you al ready own and playing offense means scanning the other thousands of listed companies for new and superior ideas Theres a lot of truth to the expression The harder I work the luckier I get If you spend many weeks and months evaluating a business and end up discarding the name after doing all the work it is not a waste of time This time is very well spent You gain insight about the business which you put in your mental data bank which in turn alerts your subconscious when a similar or related opportunity is presented the future because you know the background and the context and can assess it faster Our results today are the fruits of the hard work done in the past Buffett was reading Bank of America and IBM reports for decades before he ever bought a share Similarly the work that Iam doing today may not pay off immediately But I am confident that it is going to pay off at some crucial time in the future as has happened many times in the past when a unique insight seemingly fired up in my mind out of nowhere driven by my accumulated experiences helped me to connect the dots in a rapid manner Successful investing is all about connecting the dotsfinance is just one of the many small dots In a way investing is like chess The novice knows how the pieces move The amateur knows a few openings But it takes a grand mas ter to appreciate how it all comes together My Tryst with Commodity Investing In late 2015 the sugar stocks in India started rallying together as a group and many of them were undergoing big multiyear price volume breakouts I had never invested in a commodity stock until this point and had restricted myself to secular growth stocks I was highly biased against commodities based on my reading about the past experiences of most investors in this category John Maynard Keynes identified my problem The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones Many of my respected peers were recommending sugar stocks to me at the time as a highly promising investment opportunity I decided to come out of my comfort zone and try my hand in commodity stock investing for the first time After studying many companies in the sugar sector I bought shares of Balrampur Chini in May 2016 I was excited about this selec tion as the company was widely regarded as having the most efficient operations and the best balance sheet in the entire industry What transpired over the next several months however left me completely perplexed Although the stocks of lossmaking sugar companies with bad balance sheets kept increasing rapidly Balrampur Chini went nowhere Eventually in November 2016 I sold it out of frustration ata loss of 7 percent Thus my first tryst with commodities ended on an unsuccessful note But in my eyes this entire experience had served a much big ger purpose It had opened my eyes to the strong return potential of commodity investing Thankfully I did not behave like Mark Twains cat after a bitter experience We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom in it and stop there lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stovelid She will not sit down on a hot stovelid again but also she will never sit down on acold one anymore For many months after this episode the reason I had not succeeded with Balrampur Chini remained an intriguing mystery I had picked the industrys leading company and it had turned out to be the biggest laggard My dismal performance amid such a rapid appreci ation of peer stocks in the same industry had ignited a tremendous zeal and curiosity and I began enthusiastically scouring the commodi ties universe for opportunities This journey of discovery soon led me to an industry unlike any other that I had ever witnessed before figure 201 It led me to an investment operation that soon taught me many significant lessons about commodity investing and about the critical significance of un derstanding the supply side It led me to an experience in which I was finally able to conquer many of my personal biases It led me to a de velopment in my life that exemplified the virtues of lifelong learning and to never give up when in doubt It led me to the gamechanging investment that taught me the

2017 on ward and were experiencing big multiyear price volume breakouts When you truly embrace lifelong learning Lady Luck and serendipity eventually reward you in a big way A few years earlier I had read Safal Niveshaks blog post of 2012 on Graphite India and I had developed a basic understanding of the industry This prior knowledge in turn helped me research the industry much more efficiently in 2017 In investing all learning is cumulative and nothing goes to waste Upon further study the industry prospects looked strong and true to my blueprint Ibought shares of Graphite India in August 2017 I chose it over HEG for the following reasons Graphite India had a net cash balance sheet whereas HEG was highly leveraged Graphite India had a larger capacity than HEG so it would benefit more from rising prices Graphite India was profitable even during the difficult times whereas HEG was experiencing huge losses How could I lose I had ticked off all the boxes on my commodityinvesting checklist Buy the highest quality company with the best balance sheet in the sector and you will make a killing during a cyclical upturn Except that once again things turned out horribly wrong Graphite India actually declined in price over the first two weeks of my purchase whereas HEG shot up almost 50 percent from INR 470 to INR 690 Making a mistake is unavoidable in life but losing hope becoming despondent and living with your errors is a choice This time I refused to take it lying down When you do not understand something simply roll up your sleeves put your head down and get to work Bea learning machine I immediately read Sam Zells book Am I Being Too Subtle which drilled the core fundamental concepts of demand and supply into my mind I also reread Edward Chancellors book Capital Returns as well as the excellent chapter on commodity investing in Parag Parikhs book Value Investing and Behavioral Finance The right book at the right time will speak to you in a way that the right book at the wrong time just wont I had previously read Chancellors and Parikhs books in 2016 I did not appreciate them at the time Iread them again in 2017 and they changed my life I generally underline my favorite text in a book and write my personal notes about the key learning points on the side of the pages as Iread them and I keep referring to them from time to time Always read reread and reflect on your learnings from the books you read When you read them more than once you will notice that with the passage of time because of your accumulated personal and vicarious experience you are able to obtain additional and new insights from the same book You start developing pattern recognition Before proceeding to describe what happened next I would like to spend some time discussing intuition Harnessing the Power of Intuition to Our Advantage You need a certain amount of intelligence but its wasted over a certain level After that its more about intuition emphasis added Stanley Druckenmiller First of all I trust my own instinct experience that I gained over years and feeling emphasis added when the moment is right for buying shares That is what one calls intuition Alisher Usmanov Ive been reading IBMs annual report every year for fifty years This year I saw something that sort of clicked emphasis added Warren Buffett Selfawareness is vital to improving as an investor For some investors an intuition of danger is actualized into physical changes George Soros would sense something was wrong with his investments whenever he felt acute back pain He was selfaware enough to recognize negative emotions as some sort of warning signal As investors we should recognize sharp emotions as alarm bells Dismissing these feel ings could be a big mistake Dont just blindly reverse course every time you get a strong feeling Rather treat these feelings as catalysts to analytically reevaluate your existing position Investment decisions begin with gut feelings but always should be safeguarded with logic and hard data The role of intuition is grossly underrated in the investing profession but we can harness it effectively to our advantage if we work at it Contrary to what many people believe intuition is not some sort of magical sixth sense This emotion arises from pattern recogni tion Time may not always bring wisdom but it does provide experience which in a pinch can be a substitute for wisdom The firefighter in Malcolm Gladwells intriguing story in Blink had many years of experience in his field The expertise gained from his experience trained his subconscious to come to expect certain patterns Likewise Warren Buffetts intuition did not develop overnight It is the result of many years and decades of experience and study Buffett does not begin his investment process by comparing a bunch of possible investment alternatives And he does not use quantitative screening tools Instead he intuitively gravitates toward a company he finds interesting and understands He then analyzes the com pany its industry and its valuation to determine whether the investment makes sense If it does not he moves on to the next company his intuition leads him to analyze If this potential investment seems attractive Buffett again relies on his intuition with regard to the managements competence and trustworthiness He also utilizes his gut instinct with regard to position sizing judging individuals and sensing danger For example he doesnt assess that one investment should be worth X amount based on analytics alone A meaningful portion of that decision is based on intuition Visualization exercises are a great way for investors to develop intuition When an investor conducts a premortem and imagines an investment failing and tries to visualize all the possible reasons for the loss he or she develops intuition about what negative develop ments to watch for Investors who have a better idea of what can go wrong with their individual businesses are better prepared for the fu ture This selfawareness empowers them to sell on time while others are still evaluating the unexpected for them developments When multiplied over many trades and compounded over many years this minor advantage leads to material outperformance Igained many valuable lessons on commodity investing during my extensive study of the field in 2017 Wellmanaged lowcost commodity producers usually do not generate higher returns Highcost producers do because they show a higher percentage gain in profitability This is highly counterintuitive for most investors Acommodity upcycle lifts all the players in the industry This is where the low base effect becomes essential It is relatively easier to improve earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization EBITDA margins from 5 percent to 10 percent than from 20 percent to 40 percent This is why the laggards score over the leaders This makes their stocks go up much faster In in vesting always focus on delta that is on the rate of change in earnings growth and its underlying quality When comparing commodity stocks and deciding which one to buy evaluate them in terms of enterprise value EV to installed capacity HEG was cheaper than Graphite India on this metric Most of the time sector leaders move up first and become expensive Then the attention turns to the secondary players in the in dustry Investors begin to realize that these secondary players are cheaper and they bid them up For lossmaking companies with sizeable revenues and a low market captosales ratio even a small improvement in profit margin adds a significant number to the profit value In addition lossmaking companies usually have sizeable tax loss carryforwards from the previous downcycle resulting in lower taxes and high net profits during the upcycle Newbie investors extrapolate these temporary supernormal profit numbers into infinity and they chase these stocks at close to their peak earnings You will hear analysts and sometimes even renowned investors say This time its different and it is a structural longterm change in the industry dynamics which should drive sustainablyhigher valuation multiples During boom times for any commodity people forget how horrible the past downcycle was and how horrible the future one will be too Commodity stocks are valued on an EVEBITDA multiple not on pricetoearnings Investors in commodity stocks need to shift focus away from the profitandloss statement to a balance sheetdriven approach When looking at a commodity stock debt is one of the most important items to look at as it has a significant impact on earnings because of the tax shield on interest payments and on market cap during an upcycle As operating cash flows improve debt falls and EBITDA rises for the highly leveraged players the entire debt reduction amount flows to the equity side of the enterprise value equation and market cap rises sharply Some companies use the favorable business conditions to refinance their debt at more favorable terms and lower rates of interest giving a material boost to their earnings per share Instead of looking at just the total installed capacity pay attention to existing capacity utilization and room for excess capacity to take advantage of the higher selling prices in an upcycle Operating leverage is powerful in these situations HEG was operating at a lower capacity utilization than was Graphite India Keep in mind that operating leverage cuts both ways Those who accu rately identify it end up winning big and those who misunderstand it end up losing big Inacommodity upcycle the integrated players with captive power or raw material linkages are the biggest beneficiaries HEG had access to captive power and had cogeneration power capacity of 77 megawatts Never ignore the power of incentives Align your interests with those of the insiders HEGs promoter was continuously buying shares from the open market in August and September 2017 Generally this is a good method to identify the turning point in an industrys fortunes The promoters of many companies start increasing their ownership through preferential allotment or by issuing warrants to themselves together at around the same time just ahead of a broadbased recovery in their industry Some agricultural commodities like sugar are highly water intensive In those cases be on the lookout for deficient monsoons particularly backtoback ones This leads toa sharp decline in output This is what happened in Indias sugar sector in 2015 Sometimes even within a country the rainfall distribution is highly uneven leading to water shortage in certain geographies Check whether prices are determined domestic or international Also check whether any restrictions have been placed on the import and export of the commodity Sometimes government intervention in the form of antidumping duties or minimum import prices also acts as a good support for selling prices A profitable timing of entry in such cases is exactly when the gov ernment imposes such duties or protectionist measures and deems them to be in force for a period of five years or more rather than just fora single year When many companies start announcing capacity expansions it is a good signal to reevaluate ones thesis or to exit This is because commodity producers tend to engage in the misallocation of capital or diworsification initiatives around the peak of acycle They act consistently with what Peter Lynch calls the bladder theory of corporate finance The more cash that builds up in the treasury the greater the pressure to piss it away Commodity stocks are not longterm investments They generate alpha in portfolios in a short period of time driven by a combina tion of financial and operating leverage and you exit them not on peak reported earnings but when the expectations of margin improvement peak out A good time to begin planning your exit from a commodity industry is when the government decides to curb its profitability This usually coincides with the period during which the industry starts becoming obscenely profitable and the cycle approaches its peak For example by the time government intervention in Indias sugar industry began in 2017 smart investors already had made hundreds of percentage points of returns on many sugar stocks and had begun to offload their big winners onto the greedy latecomers to the party Selective opportunistic plays in commodities often arise between the start of the Chinese winter when many plants shut down because of smog issues and the beginning of summer when the plants resume production Commodity investing is highly challenging and counterintuitive as stocks can hit fiftytwoweek lows even while posting record high earnings Stocks react less to reported earnings and more to supply dynamics and expectations of margin improvement having peaked out Commodity stocks typically embark on the inevitable decline from their peak when the markets expect earnings to peak out or decline after a couple of quarters Once you get a sense that this is happening do not wait to observe the next quarterly results Exit while the market is still obliging Be highly alert and have a firm risk management discipline When only a single firm in the entire industry is profitable then the commodity in question may be at or near the bottom of the cycle In the future when a set of facts similar to those of a typical capital cycle start becoming visible our experienced judgment that is our intuition will help us recognize the pattern in a timely manner

becoming even tighter figure 206 When the facts change change your mind I immediately re purchased HEG at INR 2700 this time with half the percentage allocation that I had at the time of exit figure 207 In one single go Iwas able to conquer a host of personal biases that had affected me since the beginning of my investing careeranchoring bias commitment and consistency bias and status quo bias This is why the HEG investment will always be special to me It was a significant step forward in my evolution toward rationality I finally exited HEG at a profit of 64 percent shortly after the companys first quarter FY2019 results announcement in August 2018 according to my assessment at the time margin improvement had finally peaked for HEG as higher needle coke contract prices would start taking effect after a few months resulting in a compounded total profit of more than 350 percent on my initial invested capital in this companys stock This is the power of compounding good investing decisions in action This outcome was driven entirely by the sheer intensity of the pursuit of lifelong learning on the part of an individual with average intellect The pursuit of knowledge enabled me to overcome my initial limitations in understanding a given subject matter Learning never stops when you are truly passionate You are constantly in the process of challenging yourself and operating near the edge of your limits This is what deliberate practice is all about Over time these additional small gains that you manage to squeeze out of individual securities during your journey add up to a significant amount when compounded multiple times over They really do In my investing experience to date I have not yet had even one tenbagger a much hallowed achievement among investors But I did not require that level of a big individual stock success story to achieve financial freedom Multiplicative compounding of smaller multibaggers many times over helped me realize my dream I experienced the joys of compounding Lalways kept this simple math in my mind Ten thousand dollars Two tenbaggers Millionaire For a successful investing career what matters is the longterm compound annual growth rate in overall portfolio value with the least possible risk not the number of stocks it took you to achieve it My Early Beginnings with Investing in Cyclicals During the past few years my circle of competence gradually expanded to cover cyclicals like infrastructure and construction I gained important insight during this period while studying a company named Dilip Buildcon when it comes to the infrastructure and construc tion sectors the market rewards the stocks of only those companies that have strong execution capabilities and a healthy balance sheet that can support fundraising for the execution of future order wins This very insight eventually helped me identify PSP Projects in 2018 Thad erroneously ignored PSP during its IPO in May 2017 because of stereotyping bias Investors generally do not perceive the construction industry to have good standards of corporate governance and this industry regularly incurs time and cost overruns But PSP Projects named after its founder Prahaladbhai Shivrambhai Patel was a clear exception The company enjoyed a stellar reputation for timely and highquality execution in its hometown of Ahmedabad India This in turn had led to regular repeat business from its key clients Since its inception in 2009 PSP had executed thirteen projects for Cadila Healthcare and its affiliates six projects for Torrent Pharmaceuticals and its affiliates and four projects for Nirma and its affiliates The company also had executed many marquee projects for the government including portions of the Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad and renovation of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly build ing In its 2017 annual review of Indian operations Peri Group one of the worlds largest manufacturers of formwork and scaffolding mentioned twentyfive marquee projects for which their formworks were used by contractors and it singled out PSP for having excellent capabilities In November 2017 PSP won a project valued at INR 1575 crore US225 million to construct the Surat Diamond Bourse in Gujarat amid stiff competition from much larger and wellestablished peers This single project was expected to add annual revenues at arun rate equivalent to the current run rate of the entire company More important the successful completion of this project would give PSPs reputation for executing largescale projects a big boost and would catapult PSP into the league of larger constructors like LT and Shapoorji in a field in which competition is limited to five or six players It also would help PSP win similar projects outside its home terri tory of Ahmedabad in the future In essence the addressable opportunities for PSP were expected to expand manifold over time PSPs revenues operating profit and net profit had grown at a compound annual growth rate of 18 percent 34 percent and 38 per cent respectively from FY2012 to FY2017 and it maintained a debtfree balance sheet and strong return ratios average return on equity of more than 35 percent On the basis of its current order book and its vastly improved prospects for largesize order wins in the future healthy growth rates were expected over the medium to long term In addition to these factors the reading of a January 2018 Outlook Business article on PSP by Bhavin Shah further boosted my conviction in the company In that article Shah highlighted some important points2 PSP had the lowest receivables days among its peers and its threeyear average was just twentynine days compared with 128 for its peers Along with advances received for mobilization which supports twenty to twentyfive days of execution PSP in effect was able to run its operations on a negative carry mode about forty days of negative cash conversion cycle This in turn helped PSP keep its suppliers happy as reflected in its creditor days of seventyfive days compared with 124 for its peers Instead of ordering large quantities of materi als PSP ordered just enough material to continue the work Asa result it was able to maintain inventory for fewer than five days against an industry average of fifty to ninety days This was exceptional working capital management As investors we make our money off the income statement but we survive off the balance sheet A cookedup income statement eventually sinks in the quicksand of the balance sheet A bull market merely delays the inevitable for such companies In addition to commodities and cyclicals another section of the market often provides great opportunities for alpha generation spinoffs CHAPTER 21 WITHIN SPECIAL SITUATIONS CAREFULLY STUDY SPINOFFS Special situations are the happy hunting grounds for the simonpure analyst who prefers to deal with the future in terms of specific measurable developments emphasis added rather than general anticipations Benjamin Graham special situations in the fourth quarter 1946 issue in which he wrote In the broader sense a special situation is one in which a particular development is counted upon to yield a satisfactory profit in the security even though the general market does not advance In the narrow sense you do not have a real special situation unless the particular development is already under way emphasis added U nder the pen name Cogitator Benjamin Graham wrote several articles for The Analysts Journal He penned a seminal article on Graham concluded the article by summing up the essence of a special situation as an expected corporate not market develop ment within a time period estimable in the light of past experience2 During one of the meetings Mohnish Pabrai had with Charlie Munger Munger explained that an investment operation would do exceedingly well to focus on three things 1 Carefully look at what other great investors are doing This includes following their 13F filings 2 Look at cannibals or companies that are buying back huge amounts of their own stock 3 Carefully study spinoffs The very fact that Munger singled out a specific category for a special situation ie spinoffs is enough to make any serious investor take note Iwas able to better appreciate and understand Mungers keen endorsement for spinoffs when I learned about their high base rates of success A global study conducted by consulting firm The Edge and accounting firm Deloitte looked at 385 global spinoffs from January 2000 to June 2014 involving parent companies with a market cap of 250 million or more To qualify transactions needed to be pure spinoffs with shareholders of parent companies receiving shares of newly listed companies The study found that the worldwide asset class of spinoffs generated more than ten times the average gains of the MSCI World Index during their first twelve months independent of the parent2 The best performance came from the consumer healthcare utility and energy sectors Importantly value creation did not depend on economic growth or company coverage by analysts On average two out of ten spinoffs were either acquired or taken private within two years In India the performance of spinoffs is even more remarkable SBI Capital analyzed 154 spinoff transactions in India during the 20022016 period and showed how spinoffs outperformed the broader market indices across market cycles Their study showed spinoffs generating an average excess return over the market index Sensex of around 36 percent Investors often receive a blanket piece of advice like Never add to a losing position or Do not ever average on the downside or avoid catching a falling knife I simply recommend this always think it over A profitable opportunity often arises when a promising but smallsize company demerged from a largesize parent is listed and has residual institutional holding During its initial weeks and months of trading you often observe forced selling by institutions that cannot hold the new stock in their portfolios because of certain rigid institutional mandates such as being allowed to invest only in certain sec tors or restrictions on market cap and you end up with sizeable paper losses on your existing holding of the demerged companys shares Whenever someone sells in desperation they tend to sell cheap As a buyer I love to be on the opposite side of such trades in which the other party is being forced to liquidate holdings at any price regardless of underlying value The time to buy is when those investors are ina hurry to dump shares at any price These institutions submit the relevant declarations and bulk deals information to the ex changes on the same day that these large trades are executed Keeping track of these filings in a diligent manner is the key to investment success in such situations Spinoffs represent live case studies on time arbitrage in which the patient investor is paid for merely waiting and letting the proce dural formalities take their due course A demerger process in India typically involves a sequence of six steps 1 board approval 2 stock exchange approval 3 secured and unsecured creditors and shareholders approval 4 National Company Law Tribunal final approval 5 record date announcement by the board and 6 listing of the demerged entity Some of the most profitable demerger opportunities arise when the listed conglomerate entity trades at a low valuation multiple The demerged entities however would have traded at a far higher multiple once separated which sometimes is based on completely different valuation parameters than the currently listed parent entity Having a sound understanding of both the relative valuations and the different metrics used for valuing the various kinds of businesses in the stock market gives the diligent investor a significant advan tage in spinoffs The sum of the parts is often more than the whole At times a lot more This happens in those situations in which a loss making business is spun off from the parent company and then sandbagged with most of the formers debt The parent companys valua tion multiple net profit and market cap go up because of enhanced profitability and a stronger balance sheet At the same time the loss making business gets some market cap based on multiples like pricetosales ratio or EVEBITDA the enterprise value to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization Seth Klarman Joel Greenblatt and Peter Lynch have discussed spinoffs in great detail in their past works Spinoff companies often do not publicize the attractiveness of their business and undervaluation of their stock as they prefer to ini tially fly under the radar Klarman explains that this is because management often receives stock options based on initial trading prices until these options are in fact granted there is an incentive to hold the share price down Consequently a number of spinoff companies make little or no effort to have the share price reflect underlying value Klarman states that the parent company also can represent an attractive investment opportunity in certain cases He frequently recommends spinoffs as a fertile ground for finding attractive investments In a 2009 speech at the Ben Graham Center for Investing Klar man said Spinoffs are an interesting place to look because theres a natural constituency of sellers and theres not a natural constituency of buyers Joel Greenblatt is the most widely known proponent of investing in spinoffs In his seminal book on special situation investing You Can Be a Stock Market Genius Greenblatt dedicates a full seventysix pages to a discussion of spinoffs Greenblatt quotes a Penn State study that found spinoffs outperform the market by 10 percent per year If you assume that the market will return 10 percent then theoretically you can make 20 percent per year by just blindly buying spinoffs What if you selectively choose which spinoffs to invest in You potentially could exceed 20 percent Next Greenblatt discusses five reasons why a parent may spinoff a subsidiary 1 Usually conglomerates trade at a conglomerate discount By separating the unrelated businesses management can unlock value In other words the sum of the parts is greater than the whole 2 To separate a bad business from a good business 3 To realize value for a subsidiary that cant easily be sold 4 To recognize value while avoiding a large tax bill that would become due if the parent company pursued a sale instead of a spinoff 5 To resolve a regulatory hurdle For instance a company may be in the process of being acquired It may need however to spin offa sub sidiary to address antitrust concerns Another reason why spinoffs do so well as Greenblatt explains is because capitalism with all its drawbacks actually works2 Once a spinoff is complete its management is freed from the bureaucracy of the parent and is empowered to make changes that will create shareholder value because if management owns a significant portion of the spinoffs stock they will benefit directly Greenblatt writes A strategy of investing in the shares of a spinoff or parent company should ordinarily result in a preselected portfolio of strongly share holderfocused companies By proceeding with a spinoff a management team makes a strong statement that it cares about shareholder returns Next Greenblatt explains how to pick the best spinoffs and shares the characteristics he looks for 1 Institutions dont want it and their reasons dont involve the investment merits In addition to the reasons outlined so far it is com mon for the spinoff entity to be loaded up with debt or cash Loading up the spinoff is a way for the parent company to transfer these assets and liabilities in a taxfree manner Understanding what the postspinoff balance sheet looks like helps investors better analyze its potential performance Greenblatt talks about how the presence of leverage can result in asymmetrical payoffs Say what you will about the risks of investing in such companies the rewards of sound reasoning and good research are vastly multiplied when applied in these leveraged circumstances Tremendous leverage would magnify our returns if spinoff turned out for some reason to be more at tractive than its initial appearances indicated emphasis added 2 Insiders want it Always obtain a sound understanding of the incentives management has for performance within the spinoff Greenblatt uses management incentives as his top metric when evaluating a spinoff Insider participation is one of the key areas to look for when picking and choosing between spinoffsfor me the most important area Are the managers of the new spinoff incentivized along the same lines as shareholders Will they receive a large part of their potential compensation in stock restricted stock or options Is there a plan for them to acquire more When all the required public documents about the spinoff have been filed I usually look at this area first The management team of the parent company is generally more interested in managing a larger business so if they decide to move toa smaller company wherein they receive a healthy stockbased compensation investors should definitely dig further Another situation worth studying is when the management of the demerged entity announces a buyback soon after listing but refrains from participating in the buyback in order to increase its stake 3 A previously hidden investment opportunity is created or revealed Greenblatt writes This could mean that a great business or a statistically cheap stock is uncovered as a result of the spinoff Always study and evaluate how both the parent and the spinoff will look after the spinoff transaction This is because the postspinoff opportunity may not reside exclusively in the demerged entity Greenblatt says The point is that looking at a parent company that is about to be stripped clean of a complicated division can lead to some pretty interesting opportunities As investors we have the option to take a position in the parent the spinoff or both depending on which is the more profitable course of action In other words if the management of the spinoff starts trumpeting its bright prospects immediately after the spinoffs listing take it asa signal that the management is not looking to meaningfully hike its stake in it Greenblatt recommends studying the relevant Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings to check whether the spinoffs management will have a substantial option package He writes Ina situation where managements option package is substantial it may be a good idea to establish a portion of your stock position before emphasis added management becomes incentivized to start promoting the new spinoffs stock Always study insider incentives A way to do that is to pull out the spinoffs Form 10128 filing in the United States this is the document that the parent company files with the SEC before the separation and search for executive compensation There we should be able to learn how many shares of the spinoff are reserved for the new management and employee incentives For example a spinoff may have the following in its Form 1012B The aggregate number of shares that may be issued pursuant to incentive awards under the Equity Plan is the sum of X shares Then simply calculate what percentage of the spinoffs total shares outstanding these shares represent In his investing classic One Up on Wall Street Peter Lynch speaks highly about the merits of spinoffs He begins by saying Spinoffs often result in astoundingly lucrative investments Lynch believes parent companies do not want to spin off divisions that could fail as this would reflect poorly on the parent He writes Once these companies are granted their independence the new management free to run its own show can cut costs and take cre ative measures that improve the nearterm and longterm earnings2 spinoffs receive little attention from Wall Street are usually misunderstood and thus are mispriced by investors All this bodes well for future returns Lynch recommends looking for spinoffs with insider buying as this will confirm the managements belief in the spinoffs longterm potential If you hear about a spinoff or if youre sent a few fractions of shares in some newly created company begin an immediate in vestigation into buying more A month or two after the spinoff is completed you can check to see if there is heavy insider buying among the new officers and directors This will confirm that they too believe in the companys prospects emphasis added Remember insiders may sell for many reasons including personal ones But insiders have only one reason to buy their own stock they believe it will go up A particularly strong insider buying signal is what is known as a clusterbuy This occurs when three or more insiders from a management team make openmarket purchases within a short period of time Pay special attention when you see a chief financial officer buying stock from the open market Its generally not in their DNA to think like an owner Value investor Jae Jun of Old School Value studied the firstyear performance of all the spinoffs in the United States between 2001 and 2011 that had heavy insider buying within a week of being spun off The findings were remarkable all but one of the spinoffs beat the market index performance by a wide margin table 211 TABLE 211 Firstyear performance of spinoffs in the United States with heavy insider buying within a

strongly incentivized management the initial forced selling in spinoffs often leads to some attractive opportunities SECTION IV PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT CHAPTER 22 THE HOLY GRAIL OF LONGTERM VALUE INVESTING Leaving the question of price aside the best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremen tal capital at very high rates of return emphasis added The worst business to own is one that must or will do the oppositethat is consistently employ evergreater amounts of capital at very low rates of return Warren Buffett core test of success for a business is whether every dollar it invests generates a market value of more than that amount for the shareholders Warren Buffett calls this the onedollar test and he explains it in his 1984 letter Unrestricted earnings should be retained only when there is a reasonable prospectbacked preferably by historical evidence or when appropriate by a thought ful analysis of the futurethat for every dollar retained by the corporation at least one dollar of market value will be created for owners This will happen only if the capital retained produces incremental earnings equal to or above those generally available to investors When Buffett talks about a dollar of retained capital creating a dollar of market value he prefers to apply this test ona fiveyear rolling basis he is talking about a dollar of intrinsic value His implication is that the stock market will be a fairly accurate judge of intrin sic value over time A simple way to do a quick onedollar test is to compare the change in beginning and ending market value of a com pany over a period of time to the change in its beginning and ending retained earnings values Basically Buffett is saying that the market over time will reward those companies that create high returns on the dollars they keep by giving them a higher valuation multiple and will punish those companies whose retained dollars fail to earn their keep by giving them a lower valuation multiple According to Charlie Munger Over the long term its hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns If the business earns 6 percent on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years youre not going to make much different than a 6 percent return even if you originally buy it at a huge discount Conversely if a business earns 18 percent on capital over 20 or 30 years even if you pay an expensive looking price youll end up with a fine result2 The math behind Mungers assertion is easy to follow An 18 percent return on invested capital ROIC over a multidecade period will dominate a 6 percent ROIC in terms of shareholder returns Simple Its simple but not easy One of the biggest challenges in investing is determining the competitive advantage of a business and more important the durabil ity and longevity of that advantage Competitive advantage is defined as a companys ability to generate excess returns that is ROIC less cost of capital A sustainable competitive advantage is defined as a companys ability to generate excess returns over an extended period of time which requires bar riers to entry to prevent competitors from entering the market and eroding the excess returns This in turn enables excess returns on invested capital for long periods of time also known as the competitive advantage period CAP Growing firms with excess returns and longer CAPs are more valuable in terms of net present value The value of a companys CAP is the sum of the estimated cash flows solely generated by these excess returns discounted for the time value of money and the uncertainty of receiving those cash flows Ina 1999 interview with Fortune Buffett highlighted moats as the main pillar of his investing strategy The products or services that have wide sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors In his 2007 letter Buffett wrote what is considered by many to be the seminal piece on competitive advantage and value creation in which he discussed great good and gruesome businesses4 For an increase in earnings to be evaluated properly it always should be compared with the incremental capital investment required to produce it Great businesses are those with an everincreasing stream of earnings with virtually no major capital requirements They produce extraordinarily high returns on incremental invested capital The truly great businesses are literally drowning in cash all the time They tend to earn infinitely high return on capital as they require little tangible capital to grow and are driven by intangible assets such as a strong brand name with share of mind intellectual property or proprietary technology Great businesses typically are characterized by negative working capital low fixed asset intensity and real pricing power Negative working capital means that customers are paying the company cash up front for goods or services that will be delivered at a later date This is a powerful catalyst for a growing company as the customers are essentially financing the companys growth through prepayments Best of all the interest rate on this financing is zero percent which is tough to beat Negative working capital is common in subscriptionbased business models in which customers pay up front for recurring service or access Because revenue is recognized when the service is performed which is after the cash comes in these businesses typically have operating cash flow that exceeds net income Low fixed asset intensity can be analyzed by comparing annual sales to net property plant and equipment or capital expenditures In the franchisor business model the franchisor collects a royalty from franchisees in exchange for the use of the brand name business plan and other proprietary assets The overall system grows as franchisees supply the capital to build new locations enabling the fran chisor to increase revenue and earnings without deploying additional capital This business model is great if it can be scaled up because it is capital light and throws off lots of free cash flow by simply leveraging the brandname equity of the franchisor This is why Buffett says The best business is a royalty on the growth of others requiring little capital itself Firms that outsource their core manufacturing ac tivities while focusing on design marketing and branding efforts also have low fixed asset intensity If the business provides a product or service that is differentiated has high switching costs or is critical to customers while constituting a minuscule percentage of overall cost it may be able to consistently raise prices at levels exceeding inflation This method is the simplest way to grow earnings without additional capital because the flowthrough margins on price increases are usually quite high Companies such as Bloomberg and Sees Candies have long histories of raising prices at or above inflationary rates and Buffett con siders this to be one of the most important variables when analyzing a business The single most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing power emphasis added If youve got the power to raise prices without losing business to a competitor youve got a very good business Great businesses are rare scarce and thus valuable They are usually given rich valuation multiples by the market when longevity of growth is predictable with a high degree of certainty Indeed longevity of growth is becoming increasingly scarce in todays world which is characterized by rapid pace of change The average time a company spent in the SP 500 in the 1960s was about sixty years Today the average is barely ten years Fewer than 12 percent of the Fortune 500 companies in 1955 were still on the list sixtytwo years later in 2017 and 88 percent of the companies in 1955 had either gone bankrupt or had merged with or were acquired by another firm If they still exist they have fallen from the top Fortune 500 companies as ranked by total revenues This is Joseph Schumpeters creative destruction at its very best The market places a heavy weight on certainty Stocks with the promise of years of predictable earnings growth tend to go into a long period of overvaluation until such time that they are no longer able to grow earnings in a steady manner Predictability of longterm growth matters more to the market than the absolute rate of nearterm growth so a stock that promises to grow earnings at 50 percent for the next couple of years with no clarity thereafter is given a lower valuation multiple by the market than a stock that has slower but highly predictable growth for a much longer period Consistent growth increases valuation consistent disruption decreases valuation The longevity of growth is always given a greater weight by the market than the absolute rate of growth so you often will notice stocks with 12 percent to 15 percent predictable earnings growth for the next ten to fifteen years getting current year pricetoearnings PE multiples of 40x to 50x This phenomenon perplexes most new investors but with experience they come to appreciate the finer nuances of the market and respect its wisdom The expensive highquality secular growth stocks tend to remain at elevated valuations for ex tended periods of time because investors in such stocks generally are willing to sit out periods of high valuation until earnings catch up Markets provide disproportionate rewards to companies that can promise years of sustainable earnings growth The principle of scarcity premium applies to the number of highgrowth stocks available in an individual sector as well as in the overall market A business with a perceived sustainable growth rate of 30 percent to 35 percent often ends up getting a 40x to 50x PE or an even higher valuation that generally keeps expanding throughout the entire duration of the bull run as long as the high growth expec tations are intact if only a few companies in the market are able to achieve such high growth rates In contrast a business growing at 20 percent may not get more than 15x to 20x PE if many 20 percent growers are available This is why looking at the PEtogrowth ratio also known as PEG ratio in isolation can result in suboptimal return outcomes When growth becomes scarce the market breadth narrows and demandsupply dynamics take over During bearish phases investors want certainty of growth whereas during bullish phases they are ready to take a leap of faith During such periods of uncer tainty the markets focus becomes extremely narrow and valuations of the select few highquality growth stocks in the market keep expanding until their growth rate remains at aboveaverage levels relative to the majority of the stocks in the market Most investors remain in denial during this phase as these expensive stocks keep becoming more expensive When growth finally starts decelerating the valuation derating begins The actual threat to a bull market stock is not excessive valuation but a sharp correction in its growth ex pectations by the investor community because valuations remain expensive and then become excessive until such time as the company delivers aboveaverage rates of growth Markets love uninterrupted rates of high growth and accord rich valuations to companies that can convince the market that they have the ability to consistently deliver aboveaverage rates of growth over longer periods of time Investors with a bias against high PE stocks miss some of the greatest stock market winners of all time Over ten years or more a high PE company thats growing earnings per share at a much faster rate eventually will outperform a lower PE company growing at a slower rate This will be true even if some valuation derating occurs in the interim period for the former If it comes to a choice between a 15 percent grower at 15x PE and a 30 percent grower at 30x PE investors always should choose the latter particularly when longevity of growth is highly probable As investors we constantly try to identify emerging moats so that we benefit not only from the initial high growth years of the company but also from the subsequent valuation rerating as well An example would be a lowermargin and workingcapitalintensive businesstobusiness B2B company transitioning into a highermargin businesstoconsumer B2C company with superior terms of trade Even if we miss the initial high growth phase but can identify these emerging moat businesses during their intermediate stages a lot of wealth is created over time Good businesses are those that require a significant reinvestment of earnings to grow and produce reasonable returns on incremen tal invested capital Many businesses fall in this putuptoearnmore category Gruesome businesses are those that earn below their cost of capital and still strive for high growth even though that growth requires significant sums of additional capital and destroys value These businesses usually are highly capital intensive and are subject to rapid technological obsolescence They never make any real economic profits because they are subject to the Red Queen effectthat is they keep investing more and more capital just to keep pace with competition and to remain at the same starting position or they stop investing in new technology and are obliterated Debt intense competition and high capital intensity together make for a deadly concoc tion Buffett describes them best The worst business of all is the one that grows a lot where youre forced to grow just to stay in the game at all and where youre reinvesting the capital at a very low rate of return And sometimes people are in those businesses without knowing it Consequently the managements of these businesses often mindlessly mimic their competitors after falling prey to what Buffett calls the institutional imperative They are not aware that they are constantly trying to run up a down escalator whose pace has accel erated to the point at which upward progress has halted They are blindsided by the rapid growth rate at an industry level and fail to heed Benjamin Grahams warning Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors2 Buffett learned this valuable insight from his teacher very well In his 1999 interview with Fortune he said The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society or how much it will grow but rather determining the competitive advan tage of any given company and above all the durability of that advantage9 The next time an analyst or socalled market expert touts the rapid growth rate of any industry as a justification for investing in the stocks within that industry watch out When all else is equal a higher ROIC is always good The same cant be said for growth Investing is all about individual stocks and their economic characteristics If you want to participate in the high growth rate of an industry that is characterized by poor profitability do so indirectly through an an cillary industry that has better economics and lower competition the bestcase scenario would be if its a monopoly business and the sole supplier to all the players in the primary industry For example the organized luggage industry in India characterized by moderate com petition could be used as a proxy to profit from the high traffic growth of airlines characterized by hypercompetition Buffett sums up the discussion in his 2007 letter with a great analogy To sum up think of three types of savings accounts The great one pays an extraordinarily high interest rate that will rise as the years pass The good one pays an attractive rate of interest that will be earned also on deposits that are added Finally the gruesome account both pays an inadequate interest rate and requires you to keep adding money at those disappointing returns We prefer businesses that drown in cash An example of a different business is construction equipment You work hard all year and there is your profit sitting in the yard We avoid businesses like that We prefer those that can write us a check at the end of the year Charlie Munger Recall Buffetts definition of the best business to own I love the business Munger talks about which cuts me a check every year from its owner earnings Ideally however Iam looking for a business that will forgo sending me a check because it has attractive internal rein vestment opportunities In other words I prefer a business that not only produces high returns on invested capital but also consistently reinvests a large portion of its earnings at similarly high returns This is the holy grail of longterm value investing At this point a busi ness has achieved true internal compounding power which is the product of two factors return on incremental invested capital and the reinvestment rate This compounding power leads to huge value creation over time This phenomenon was discovered almost a century ago by Edgar Lawrence Smith and was subsequently brought to the attention of the mainstream investment community by John Maynard Keynes who in May 1925 reviewed Smiths book Common Stocks as Long Term Investments Keynes stated This is perhaps Mr Smiths most important pointand certainly his most novel point Wellmanaged industrial companies do not as a rule distribute to their shareholders the whole of their earned profits In good years if not in all years they retain a part of their profits and put them back in the business Thus there is an element of compound interest emphasis added oper ating in favor of a sound industrial investment The two big ideas are reinvested profit and compound interest Typically compounding machines enjoy a niche positioning or some durable competitive advantage that allows them to achieve high returns on capital for a long time The key to investing in these rein vestment moats lies in the conviction that the runway ahead for growth is long and that the competitive advantages that produce those high returns will sustain or strengthen over time When I look at highROIC businesses I am really looking for return on incremental invested capital ROIIC that is the return a business can generate on its incremental investments over time The growth of a companys intrinsic value depends on the returns it can earn on its incremental invested capital Whether growth is good or bad is contingent on ROIIC For companies that have a large spread between ROIIC and cost of capital high growth is good and adds a lot of value All things being equal for such companies faster growth translates directly into a higher PE multiple The value of highROIIC companies is ex tremely sensitive to changes in perceived rates of growth Investors tend to confuse ROIIC with ROCE return on capital employed or ROIC ROIIC less cost of capital drives value creation Even though legacy moat businesses with established franchises and low or no growth opportunities may have high return on invested capital if you purchase their stock today and own it for ten years it is unlikely that you will achieve exceptional returns In this case the companys high ROIC reflects returns on prior invested capital rather than on incremental invested capital In other words a 20 percent reported ROIC today is not worth as much to an investor if no more 20 percent ROIC opportunities are available to reinvest the profits Ma ture legacy moat businesses with good dividend yields may preserve ones capital but they are not great at compounding wealth I prefer businesses that grow intrinsic value over time This type of growth provides us with a margin of safety not just in the valuation but also in the gap between price and intrinsic value which widens over time as the business value continues to grow If two businesses Company A and Company B have the same current ROIC of 20 percent but Company A can invest twice as much as Company Bat that 20 percent rate of return then Company A will create much more value over time for its owners than Company B Both of these companies will show up as businesses that produce 20 percent ROIC but one is clearly superior to the other Company A can reinvest a higher portion of its earnings and thus it will create a lot more intrinsic value over time The longer you own Company A the wider the gap grows between Company As and Company Bs investment result Icannot emphasize this critical fact enough although valuation is more important over shorter time periods quality along with growth is much more important over long time periods seven to ten years and longer The longer you hold a stock the more the quality of that company matters Your longterm returns will almost always approximate the companys internal compounding results over time It is far more important to invest in the right business than it is to worry about whether to pay 10x or 20x or even 30 for currentyear earnings Many mediocre businesses are available at less than 10x earnings that lead to mediocre results over time for longterm owners The intrinsic value of quality business increases over time thus increasing the margin of safety in the event of a stagnant stock price This is a pleasant situation because it creates antifragility for an investor In contrast if a business is shrinking its intrinsic value time is your enemy You must sell it as soon as you can because the longer you hold it the less it is worth Time is the friend of the wonderful company the enemy of the mediocre Warren Buffett The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten Benjamin Franklin The best stocks will always seem overpriced to a majority of investors Gerald Loeb Anastonishing anomaly is that these superlative reinvestment moat opportunities often hide in plain sight Most investors shun them at first glance citing expensive current valuations and end up overlooking the longterm power of internal compounding The math behind choosing the right business is compelling Lets consider two investments and observe which yields better results over a tenyear horizon table 221 The first business Reinvestment Corporation has the ability to deploy all of its retained earnings at a high rate because of its strong reinvestment moat Of course the market acknowledges this likelihood and the entry price is fairly high at 20x earnings leading most deep value investors to scoff Conversely Undervalued Corporation is a typical Graham cigar buttthat is a steady business with a good dividend yield selling for only 10x earnings Assume that over time both companies will be valued in line with the market at 15 TABLE 221 Comparison of

Management This is the most nuanced and misunderstood aspect of investing a fair price may be a lot more than you would think if profitable reinvestment really can take place emphasis added Tom Gayner What is most importantis that stocks are not bought in companies where the dividend payout is so emphasized that it restricts realizable growth Phil Fisher When businesses treat equity capital as gold even those with limited internal compounding growth opportunities can create sig nificant shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation If excess free cash flow cannot be reinvested then look for sound capital allocation that might result in dividends or valueaccretive buybacks and acquisitions Henry Singleton of Teledyne Technologies was an exemplary capital allocator He would issue shares to acquire cheaper companies when his companys stock was trading at expensive PE multiples of 40x to 50x and when his stock PE was in single digits he would repurchase stock It is smart capital allocation to raise equity at a low dilution when the shares are trading at steep valuations To create significant shareholder value absolute size of the firm does not matter Profitability matters Businesses can achieve high returns through high profit margins Capital efficiency matters Businesses with a modest level of margins can achieve attractive returns through high asset and inventory turnover In both cases it is the growth in intrinsic value per share that ultimately matters In the long term the change in the market value tends to approximate the change in the intrinsic value of the enterprise plus any value added from capital allocation decisions ROIC can be calculated as owner earnings divided by invested capital in which invested capital equals working capital excluding excess cash plus net property plant and equipment Certain longterm valuecreating expenditures are not always categorized as capital investments but are expensed on the income statementthings like advertising expenses or research and development RD costs To be accurate you would need to know what portion of advertising is needed to maintain current earning power akin to maintenance capex The portion above that number would be similar to growth capex which should be included in capital employed RD could be thought of in the same way Investing is part art part science but over the long term investing in businesses that earn high returns on incremental invested capital significantly improves the probability of achieving aboveaverage returns Finding a great business that does all of the heavy lifting for you while you passively let value compound is about as good as it gets These businesses give longterm investors the joys of averaging upward on improved prospects and superior execution which is akin to giving a bonus to your bestperforming employees for exceeding expectations After all the promoters of our investee companies are working around the clock to create wealth for us I have a simple overarching belief that makes me joyfully average upward in the great businesses that I own Over the coming decades trillions of dollars are going to be added to Indias gross domestic product GDP The nations bestmanaged companies with proven ability to scale up oper ations will capture the bulk of this upcoming wealth creation boom in Indias stock market assuming the marketcaptoGDP ratio also known as the Buffett indicator approximates 100 percent over time When looking for moated businesses those with a sustained history of high returns on equity without much leverage or high returns on capital are a good starting point Note that I mentioned the starting point and not the final point What ultimately determines investment returns is the future trajectory of the return ratios margins balance sheet and working capital situation of a company and not the current numbers or ratios in absolute terms Wayne Gretzkys famous words are apt in this context I skate to where the puck is going to be not where it has been You might ask How does one determine whether the attractive returns of the past will continue in the future In his 1987 letter Buffett shared his insights on businesses that are built to last The Fortune champs may surprise you in two respects First most use very little leverage compared to their interestpaying capac ity Really good businesses usually dont need to borrow Second except for one company that is hightech and several others that manufacture ethical drugs the companies are in businesses that on balance seem rather mundane Most sell nonsexy products or services in much the same manner as they did ten years ago though in larger quantities now or at higher prices or both The record of these 25 companies confirms that making the most of an already strong business franchise or concentrating on a single win ning business theme is what usually produces exceptional economics emphasis added2 In terms of percentages the highquality compounder category likely will have fewer errorsthat is fewer permanent capital lossesthan the statistically cheap securities category This doesnt mean one will do better than the other as a higher winning percent age doesnt necessarily mean higher returns But if you want to reduce unforced errors or losing investments it is more beneficial to focus on highquality businesses As an investor life feels so pleasant when you are invested in highquality compounders Buffett advises Your goal as an investor should simply be to purchase at a rational price a part interest in an easily understandable business whose earnings are virtually certain to be materially higher five ten and twenty years from now Over time you will find only a few companies that meet these standardsso when you see one that qualifies you should buy a meaningful amount of stock Put together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march upward over the years and so also will the portfolios market value A few years back I randomly came across a sample table of stock returns while browsing the Internet table 222 This was the moment of awakening that made me finally realize the true power of Buffetts insight It sparked an illumination an enlightenment an oceanic feeling Something akin to the one that sent Archimedes jumping out of the tub shouting Eureka TABLE 222 Comparison of stock

years while the same money in the gruesome businesses Reliance Communications Reliance Capital DLF HDIL and GMR Infra experienced brutal destruction and would have been worth only 3000 This led me to one of the biggest findings in my investing journey great businesses created a lot of wealth even when measured from the top of the previous bull market to close to the end of the subsequent bear market To achieve big wealth creation an investor had only to hold on to them in a disciplined manner during the turbulent times in the stock market and stay the course Liquidity and sentiment drive the market index in the short term whereas individual company earnings drive stock prices in the long term Great busi nesses create enormous wealth over long holding periods across market cycles even in the midst of negative macro headlines about high inflation rising interest rates geopolitical tensions weak macroeconomic data points and political uncertainty Gruesome businesses eventually destroy wealth irrespective of whether the news is positive or negative Sample this The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 87412 on December 31 1964 and 87500 on December 31 1981 Nearly zero change in seventeen long years Yet Buffett compounded his capital at more than 20 percent compound annual growth rate during this period Investing is about identifying great businesses with highquality earnings growth and capital allocation and firmly holding on to them as longs they exhibit these characteristics The stock markets do not really matter over the long run when you invest in such busi nesses and most important stay the course Tying It Together ROIC with Competitive Advantage and Capital Allocation Critically evaluating the durability of competitive advantage and how capital allocation affects shareholder value can create a variant perception when selecting equities for long holding periods Pat Dorsey Combining the key insights from this chapter we arrive at investing nirvana longterm ownership of competitively advantaged busi nesses with significant reinvestment potential managed by excellent capital allocators and shareholderfriendly management teams Competitive Advantage The guiding principle of value creation is that companies create value by using capital they raise from investors to generate future cash flows at rates of return exceeding the cost of capital the rate investors require as payment The faster companies can increase their revenues and deploy more capital at attractive rates of return the more value they create The combination of growth and return on invested capital ROIC relative to its cost is what drives value Companies can sustain strong growth and high returns on invested capital only if they have a welldefined competitive advantage This is how competitive advantage the core concept of business strategy links to the guiding principle of value creation emphasis added The corollary of this guiding principle known as the conser vation of value says anything that doesnt increase cash flows doesnt create value Timothy Koller Companies that produce high returns on capital generally do so in one of two ways by earning aboveaverage profit margins or by turning over their capital quickly This is essentially the crux of the DuPont analysis Return on invested capital Owner earnings Sales x Sale Invested capital Businesses achieve high returns on capital through an advantage either on the consumer side high profit margins or on the pro duction side high capital turnover The smaller the business the harder it is to have competitive advantage separated and independent from the owner or promoter In small companies the PE that matters most is the promoter entrepreneur The younger the company the more the investing process becomes an art and less of a science Capitalism is brutal Excess returns attract competition Only a few rare businesses enjoy excess returns for many years by creating structural competitive advantages or economic moats An extended period of excess returns increases business value Competitive advantages stem from various sources including intan gible assets such as brands patents and licenses switching costs network effects or lowcost advantages Intangible Assets Some brands are ubiquitous and widely trusted Think Budweiser Tide and Maggi They lower search costs for consumers and offer psychological advantages They make prospective customers switch from a system 2 type of slow reasoned reflective thinking to a system 1 type of fast automatic reflexive thinking through mental association and Pavlovian conditioning Some brands such as Rolex or Rolls Royce create positional value while others such as Nielsen Holdings or Gartner confer legitimacy Although positional and legitimacy brands are based on strong social consensus the incumbent brands which merely lower search costs through traditional shelfspace distribution advantages are much more vulnerable to threats from disruptive online startups Challenger brands such as Dollar Shave Club or the Craft Beer Co do not require a change in social consensus to deliver high value to new users as they cut out the intermediary and avoid the typical retail markup Moreover the use of social media platforms has dramatically reduced the cost of reaching a mass market Companies can gain scale much more quickly and acquire new customers more cheaply In ad dition to these upstarts Amazon poses a constant threat As Jeff Bezos famously quipped Your margin is my opportunity Some companies such as Apple simply offer a product or service that is far superior to their competitors products and other com panies offer a product or service of quality similar to their competitors products but simply are better at telling a story about that product such as Tiffany Co Businesses that primarily depend on marketing a story are much more vulnerable to shifting consumer behavior The most devastating substitutes cost less and have at least one feature that is superior Branding has historically served a few key pur poses to guarantee minimum assured product quality and to allow people to express their identity in a social context Brands prospered in an environment of information scarcity in which an asymmetrical relationship developed between customers and companies Signs are clear however that this trend is coming to an end Brands must be authentic because very few veils remain between a business and the public Everything is on the record all the time in todays information age In a highly connected and wellinformed world value to the customer is the most important thing to consider when analyzing a company Another intangible asset is patents Patents confer legal monopolies in the case of innovator companies and a basket of patents is preferable to an overdependence on a single patent Some regional or national monopolies have a product that customers have difficulty avoiding something like a toll road Buffett often has talked about his love for toll roads in a figurative manner such as newspapers in onenewspaper towns Likewise licenses and regulatory approvals confer legal oligopoly status through regulatory fiat as is the case with ratings agencies Switching Costs Switching costs come in many forms and may be explicit in the form of money and time or psychological resulting from deeprooted loss aversion or status quo bias These costs tend to be associated with critical products such as Oracles SAP software that are so tightly integrated with the customers business processes that it would be too disruptive and costly to switch vendors or with products that have high benefittocost ratios such as Moodys Network Effects The network effect advantage comes from providing a product or service that increases in value as the number of users expands as with Airbnb Visa Uber or the National Stock Exchange of India This functions as a strong moat as long as pricing power is not abused and the user experience does not degrade Creating a twosided network such as an auction or marketplace business requires both buyers and sellers and each group is going to show up only if they believe the other side will be present as well Once this network is established it becomes stronger as more participants from either side engage As more buyers show up more sellers are attracted which in turn attracts more buyers Once this powerful positive feedback loop is in place it becomes nearly impossible to convince either the buyer or the seller to leave and join a new platform This kind of business actually becomes stronger as it grows and displays accelerating fundamental mo mentum Look at Airbnbs strong twosided network as an example of a business model that greatly benefits from positive feedback loops figure 221 Airbnb TWO SIDED MARKETPLACE WITH OVERLAP IN BOTH SIDES geal Bee Ts More hosts altract more Quests and vice versa More hosts more avatabilty for guests More guests more

Lowcost advantages stem from various sources including process scale niche and interrelatedness Process Advantage accrues when a company creates a cheaper way to deliver a product which cannot be replicated easily as with Inditex GEICO or Southwest Airlines Scale Advantage accrues when a company spreads fixed costs over a large base as do Costco and Nebraska Furniture Mart Relative size in a market matters more than absolute size in isolation Niche Advantage accrues when a company dominates an industry with high minimum efficient scale relative to total addressable market as with Wabtec Corporation or SpiraxSarco Engineering Interrelatedness of new initiatives with existing lines of business Companies gain an advantage when their product lines or business segments are interrelated and reinforce each other as with Hester Biosciences Saurabh Madaan of Markel Corpo ration refers to this as the octopus model Phil Fisher has talked about this source of competitive advantage in the past The investor usually obtains the best results in companies whose engineering or research is to a considerable extent de voted to products having some business relationship to those already within the scope of company activities5 Lowcost producers can sell their product or service at a lower margin than competitors and still operate profitably because of the large volume of customers A good example of a lowcost producer is GEICO the direct seller of automobile insurance to Americans GEICO has the lowest operating costs in its industry primarily because it sells directly to its customers instead of hiring insurance agents Buffett has often talked about GEICOs cost advantage over its competitors as a strong moat Others may copy our model but they will be unable to replicate our economics The more customers that buy from a lowcost producer the more its cost advantage moat widens over time creating a flywheel that accelerates as the business grows Culture as a Moat We have discussed the traditional sources of competitive advantages but a muchunderappreciated source of a sustainable and difficult toreplicate competitive advantage is culture Culture is best epitomized by such companies as Berkshire Hathaway Amazon Costco Kiewit Corporation Constellation Software and Markel Corporation to name a few To illustrate the critical significance of an organizations culture consider this from 1957 to 1969 Buffett did not mention the word culture even once in his letters from 1970 to 2017 he has mentioned the word more than thirty times Businesses with a strong culture focus on delivering a great customer value proposition and communicating about the same more effectively than their competitors do To create strong value propositions firms should ask customers what they want to achieve and how they measure success and failure In stead too many firms still ask customers what they want Customers are not experts on the solution As investors we look for those companies that are fanatically obsessed with the wellbeing of their customers and that empathize with them more than their competitors do Culture matters to longterm investors because it empowers the companys employees to do their daytoday tasks slightly better than the companys competitors do theirs Over time these little advantages compound into much larger advantages which can persist far longer than conventional wisdom expects The answer to the question What will widen the companys moat should always drive managements strategy For Amazon it is improving customer experience For Costco and Nebraska Furniture Mart it is sharing scale economies For Uber it is increasing availabil ity of vehicles with welltrained drivers For Facebook it is driving user engagement When investing in businesses that are widening the moat with the passage of time these businesses invariably turn out to be much cheaper than what would have resulted from our initial valuation work High absolute market share think General Motors is not a moat Great technology products think GoPro absent customer lock in is not a moat as commoditization and disruption are inevitable Hot products like Crocs can generate high returns for a short period of time but sustainable excess returns make a moat When assessing the moat of any business simply ask yourself how quickly a smart competitor with unlimited financial resources could replicate it If your competitors know your success secret and still cant copy it you have a strong moat One question I always ask myself in appraising a business is how I would like assuming I had ample capital and skilled personnel to compete with it Warren Buffett Capital Allocation Capital allocation is the bridge between intrinsic business value and shareholder value If a company has highreturn investment oppor tunities internally it should reinvest heavily Maturing companies however often continue to invest despite declining or low returns on capital Aging is tough for companies as well as for people These companies should instead return capital via dividends or share buybacks Dividends are important not only for the obvious reason of the use of idle cash but also because they act as a disciplinefor a company to pay a dividend the profits have to be real Remember dividends are not necessarily good if they are funded poorly sometimes management takes on debt just because shareholders expect dividends or if they are paid out in lieu of investing in highnetpresent value projects and represent a large opportunity cost Share buybacks always should be driven by an objective assessment of intrinsic value but many times they are done to offset stock option dilution and manage reported earnings per share Note that buybacks do not create value they simply redistribute wealth among shareholders Buybacks transfer wealth from ongoing shareholders to former shareholders if executed above intrinsic value and vice versa Often management teams that engage in empire building destroy value through extravagant merger and acquisition MA deals Always check to see whether company size measured in terms of total revenues with no mention of profitability is a factor in manage ment compensation Managers who are paid handsomely to misallocate capital will do so Incentives matter I will tell you a secret Dealmaking beats working Dealmaking is exciting and fun and working is grubby Running anything is primarily an enormous amount of grubby detail work and very little excitement so dealmaking is kind of romantic sexy Thats why you have deals that make no sense Peter Drucker The simple MA rule of thumb is this the bigger the deal size and the less similarity between buyer and target the more likely the deal will destroy value During the MA mania of 1982 Buffett remarked that in many of these deals managerial intellect wilted in competition with managerial adrenaline The thrill of the chase blinded the pursuers to the consequences of the catch emphasis added18 Bigticket often touted as transformational MAs have low base rates of success whereas smaller tuckin or bolton acquisitions that share similar areas of activity have higher base rates of success In general MAs have a higher chance of creating value when they repre sent a core element of strategy and when management has a track record of disciplined and valueaccretive MA Firms in this category are rare Think Berkshire Hathaway Fairfax Financial Markel Corporation and Constellation Software Above all the truly exemplary capital allocators act as trustees for shareholders These individuals demonstrate rationality and complete emotional detachment when making decisions When capital is deployed in ways that amplify value shareholders benefit from both increased intrinsic business value and from valueaccretive actions Value compounds for shareholders William Thorndikes book The Outsiders has done a fantastic job of detailing some notable management teams with a talent for capital allocation12 Great capital allocators can compensate for a lack of competitive advantage as with Buffetts textile mill and a great competitive advantage can compensate for poor capital allocation including valuedestroying MA as with Microsoft To sum up quantitative data usually are priced in Qualitative insight however is less efficiently priced Schools cant teach what they cant grade Thus things that arent quantifiable or easily evaluated become niche opportunities In my view qualitative analysis is more important than quantitative analysis because quantitative data like the analyst reports is often a lagging indicator By the time you see it in the financial statements it is too late The time to evaluate quality is before the price action starts and not after it Making the correct qualitative judgment about a business including the longterm sustainability of its success attributes is more important than the entry valuation over a longterm holding period Within reason you can survive overpaying for a growing highqual ity franchise If you have to go wrong go wrong on valuation but not on quality It seems fitting to end this chapter with Buffetts views on the topic of quantitative versus qualitative investing Interestingly enough although I consider myself to be primarily in the quantitative school and as I write this no one has come back from recessI may be the only one left in the class the really sensational ideas I have had over the years have been heavily weighted toward the qualitative side where I have had a highprobability insight This is what causes the cash register to really sing However it is an infrequent occurrence as insights usually are and of course no insight is required on the quantitative sidethe figures should hit you over the head with a baseball bat So the really big money tends to be made by investors who are right on qualitative decisions but at least in my opinion the more sure money tends to be made on the obvious quantitative decisions emphasis added2 CHAPTER 23 THE MARKET IS EFFICIENT MOST BUT NOT ALL OF THE TIME The stock market is a giant distraction to the business of investing John Bogle I n Berkshire Hathaways 1987 annual letter to shareholders Warren Buffett discussed the concept of Mr Market In my opinion investment success will not be produced by arcane formulae computer programs or signals flashed by the price behavior of stocks and markets Rather an investor will succeed by coupling good business judgment with an ability to insulate his thoughts and behavior from the supercontagious emotions that swirl about the marketplace emphasis added In my own efforts to stay insulated I have found it highly useful to keep Bens Mr Market concept firmly in mind When Buffett refers to the ability of an investor to insulate his thoughts and behavior from the supercontagious emotions that swirl about the marketplace he is highlighting the critical importance of a sound temperament Buffett has always ranked temperament higher than intellect as a prerequisite for successful investing Itis easy in the world to live after the worlds opinion it is easy in solitude to live after our own but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude Ralph Waldo Emerson Dont let exuberant markets get to your head Dont let pessimistic markets get to your heart Volatility of the mind is far riskier than volatility of the stock price and an objective mind is key to investing success Remember disruptions may be accelerating but human na ture and investor psychology have not changed in centuries As the saying goes Dont throw the past away you might need it some rainy day Be an ardent student of the history of human behavior during times of utter panic as well as periods of extreme exuberance This approach will enable you to stay the course during such times and adhere to Napoleons definition of a military genius The man who can do the average thing when all those around him are going crazy Your lifetime achievement as an investor will be determined primarily by how you conduct yourself during the occasional periods of extreme market behavior Benjamin Graham had said Basically price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal At other times he will do better if he forgets about the stock market and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the operating results of his companies Read reread and reflect on this timeless piece of wisdom by Graham If you can just adhere to these words throughout your investing career you are bound to succeed This advice is what Buffett was referring to when he shared the secret to becoming rich in the stock market I will tell you how to become rich Close the doors Be fearful when others are greedy Be greedy when others are fearful emphasis added2 Mr Markets Mood Swings Affect All Sections of the Market An important paradox applies to small companies they are less well researched and yet easier to research Compared with larger compa nies the accounts are simpler the management is more accessible and the business segments are few The market often misprices small cap companies as they are relatively illiquid and often ignored by the bigger participants When it comes to bluechip stocks many investors have a common bias that reminds me of the bystander effect seen in the Kitty Genovese murder No one who witnessed the crime called the police because they all thought someone else would Many investors avoid looking at the widely followed largecap stocks because they assume that everyone else does These investors assume that such stocks must be fully priced and that they lack the possibility of having an edge The astonishing reality however is that the everpresent characteristics of greed and fear focus on shortterm thinking lack of patience and the innate desire for instant gratification among market participants frequently lead to stock prices of even the largecap bluechip companies temporarily becoming grossly out of line with their underlying intrinsic value table 231 TaBLE231 Top 10 largest companies in SP 500 as of October 11 2019 Current Percent

figures it is remarkable that even with market volatility being at alltime lows for much of this period megacap stocksthe ten of the largest most widely followed companies on the planetstill saw an average of a 45 percent gap between their fifty twoweek high and low prices Buying cheap and selling dear is always a good strategy and Mr Market keeps offering us plenty of opportunities to do so even with durable established and widely followed businesses Peter Lynch calls these companies stalwarts They are the big companies without alot of high growth potential Occasionally however you can buy them at a discount and sell them after a 30 percent to 50 percent rise which largely comes from the valuation multiple reverting back to the mean as opposed to the business value increasing Always remem ber stock prices randomly fluctuate every day sometimes wildly on either side but business value changes very slowly Therein lies the big opportunity Focusing on what is moving is part of our evolutionary instincts This explains why market participants focus more on stock prices which keep bobbing around than on business values which change quite slowly How to Think About Market Conditions at Any Point in Time Bull markets typically are fueled by cheap liquidity and usually come to an end with a sharp spike in interest rates Buffett has shared im portant insights on the significant impact of interest rates on valuations In economics interest rates act as gravity behaves in the physical world At all times in all markets in all parts of the world the tiniest change in rates changes the value of every financial asset You see that clearly with the fluctuating prices of bonds But the rule applies as well to farmland oil reserves stocks and every other financial asset And the effects can be huge on values The rates of return that investors need from any kind of investment are directly tied to the riskfree rate that they can earn from government securities So if the government rate rises the prices of all other investments must adjust downward to a level that brings their expected rates of return into lin Inthe case of equities or real estate or farms or whatever other very important variables are almost always at work and that means the effect of interest rate changes is usually obscured Nonetheless the effectlike the invisible pull of gravityis constantly there Inthe 196481 period there was a tremendous increase in the rates on longterm government bonds which moved from just over 4 at yearend 1964 to more than 15 by late 1981 That rise in rates had a huge depressing effect on the value of all invest ments but the one we noticed of course was the price of equities So therein that tripling of the gravitational pull of interest rates lies the major explanation of why tremendous growth in the economy was accompanied by a stock market going nowhere Buffett reminds us to always evaluate data in the appropriate context Stocks are high they look high but theyre not as high as they look For example the high pricetoearnings PE ratio of the US markets in 1921 should not have been concerning because corporate profits were highly depressed and at a cyclical low The slightly lower but still high PE in 1929 is the one that should have been worrisome because it was based on peak margins and earnings If any theme in the narratives of past financial crises is recurring its the sudden withdrawal of market liquidity In an interview with Barrons in 1988 Stanley Druckenmiller highlighted the critical importance of liquidity for bull markets The major thing we look at is liquidity meaning as a combination of an economic overview Contrary to what a lot of the financial press has stated looking at the great bull markets of this century the best environment for stocks is a very dull slow economy that the Federal Reserve is trying to get going emphasis added2 Investors usually step up their efforts during a bear market because of the tense environment and they tend to become complacent during a bull market Instead dream big manage risk and intensify your efforts during a bull market to achieve financial independence early in life When you are lucky to experience a bull market ensure that it makes a big difference to your life Make the most of a bull mar ket to earn Make the most of a bear market to learn At this point you may well ask But how does one identify a bull market This is how John Templeton has described bull markets Bull markets are born on pessimism grow on skepticism mature on opti mism and die on euphoria This is how Howard Marks defines the three stages of a bull market Fortunately one of the most valuable lessons of my career came in the early 1970s when I learned about the three stages of a bull market the first when a few forwardlooking people begin to be lieve things will get better the second when most investors realize improvement is actually underway and the third when everyones sure things will get better forever2 And this is how Ivaylo Ivanoy author of Ivanhoffcom describes the three stages of a typical bull market Typical market uptrends go through three main sentiment stages 1 What bull market The falll is right around the corner Most of the signs of an uptrend are already heremoney is leaving defensive names in order to chase higher yield breadth is improving correlation and volatility decline substantially Despite of that sic many people dont believe the rally and prefer to short overbought names only to get squeezed by the tidal wave of monstrous accumulation The fastest price appreciation happens in stage 1 and stage 3 2 Acceptance stage More and more people gradually warm up to the idea that we are in an uptrend and the market should be considered innocent until proven guilty Stocks have been going up for a while and the minor dips were short lived Between stage 2 and stage 3 there is usually a deeper market pullback which tests the resilience of the rally shakes weak hands out and allows for new bases to be formed The deeper pullback is used as a buying opportunity by institutions which missed the initial stages of the rally and their purchases push the market to new highs 3 Everything will go up forever During stage 1 most people are skeptical because the market has just come from a highcorrelation meanreversion environ ment and most are unwilling to see the ensuing change in market character In stage 2 investors gradually tun bullish for the simple reason that prices have been going up for a while Analysts and strategists are also turning bullish in an attempt to manage their career risk In the third stage most market participants are ecstatic not only because prices have been going up for a while but because they personally have managed to make a lot of money Everything seems easy the future looks rosy and complacency takes over proper due diligence12 Initial public offerings IPOs are an effective indicator of market sentiment During stage 1 good companies come out with IPOs at cheap valuations During stage 2 good companies come out with IPOs at expensive valuations And during stage 3 bad companies many of which do not even have any earnings come out with IPOs at ludicrous valuations and still are heavily oversubscribed by retail investors whose surging presence in the markets is a late cycle indicator Very high levels of margin funding in the primary and secondary markets is a predominant characteristic of the final blowout phase of a bull market during which the already overvalued bull market sector leaders stock prices go parabolic and double or treble in a matter of a few months toa point at which their absurd valuations can no longer be justified even by the greatest use of any imagination After this point a bear market ensues during which time common stocks are returned to their rightful longterm owners This is when Charles Mackays saying comes true Men it has been well said think in herds it will be seen that they go mad in herds while they only recover their senses slowly one by one The quality of investor portfolios is another valuable indicator of the prevailing market psychology As a bull market matures many investors tend to move their portfolios from highquality stocks with steady growth and high return on equity to cheaper but higher growth stocks with poor management quality and inferior return ratios and then to commodities and cyclicals and then to turnaround situations that are currently lossmaking and then to microcaps with limited track records of operations and finally to highly leveraged companies with projections of rapid revenue growth At this point the bull market usually tops out and at the end of the euphoric phase most investor portfolios have only junk left in them Only when the tide goes out do you discover whos been swimming in momentum During the bear market that follows both quality and junk stocks fall hard The former eventually bounce back in the subsequent recov ery whereas the latter stay low for many years until the next bull run takes over Only after going through the pain of a couple of such cycles can an investor resist the incessant urge to move down the quality ladder and chase quicker returns The greatest learnings always come from a bear market and these lessons bear fruits for an entire lifetime Never let a bear market go to waste A bear market teaches the reality of the harsh math behind compounding in reverse with fraudulent management teams or weak business models This is when we realize the deep wisdom in Andy Groves words Bad companies are destroyed by crisis good companies survive them great companies are improved by them2 And this is the catalyst for the transformational phase when investors can take huge strides and begin to rebuild their portfolios to include strong highquality businesses The key then is to not succumb to greed in the future bull markets You may have noticed that all of these bull market definitions are completely subjective They dont say that bull markets are over once we hit certain predefined valuation targets or market sentiment survey levels The best investors are willing to humbly admit that market cycles do not exhibit any certainty or predictability On this topic you should completely ignore the socalled market experts talking heads and macro forecasters It is impossible to know exactly when a market cycle will end because the pendulum can swing too far in either direction The challenging aspect of risk management in the stock market is that you can only approximately and qualitatively evaluate the extent of risk but can never precisely time the trigger that will cause this risk to play out Former Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspans highly publicized irrational exuberance comments were made in 1996 but the tech bubble popped only in March 2000 John Maynard Keynes rightly said Markets can remain irrational longer than youcan remain solvent For every data point on stock ownership or investor sentiment that shows stocks are overvalued or undervalued a logicalsounding corresponding counterargument exists Any time you see a data set or a single data point attempting to define the current stage of the stock market treat it with skepticism Markets are driven by emotion And sentiment existing only in the minds of human beings is sub ject to abrupt change without any notice The market is characterized by metarandomness Stocks are conditionally random on news News is conditionally random on people People are conditionally random on moods Moods are conditionally random on mindset Tril lions of moving parts are involved so it is simply impossible for a single variable or even a handful of variables to tell us exactly when the good or bad times will end It is easy to make logical arguments with data but far harder to convince someone to forget their feelings If investors experience an extreme economic or stock market event in the first decade of their career they tend to obsess over it repeating for their lifetime We have been inundated with crash calls since 2009 Much of this is due to recency bias because we have witnessed or experienced in the past twenty years two of the most widely documented crashes in market history Many intelligent arguments explain why the bull market should have ended It just hasnt mattered until now And it never will The stock market will always be totally unpredictable because it is a complex adaptive system George Soross reflexivity theory suggests that markets cannot possibly discount the future because they do not merely discount the future but rather also help to shape it Reflexivity is in effect a twoway feedback mechanism in which reality shapes the participants thinking and the participants thinking shapes reality in an unending loop Investors spend too much time trying to determine which year the current market setup resembles Is this 1999 all over again Is it just like 2007 How about 1987 or better yet 1929 Fun fact if you check Twitter during times of sharp market movements on either side you will observe people posting images or data drawing parallels between the current market situation and past extremes Investor actions are shaped by their most recent experiences so 2020 is just like 2020 The only constant is that investor emotions shape market behavior especially over shorter time frames This is why Templeton Marks and Ivanov all use market psychology to describe bull mar kets and not longterm cyclically adjusted PE ratios The cyclically adjusted PE ratio commonly known as the CAPE ratio or Shiller PE is a valuation measure typically applied to the SP 500 and is defined as price divided by the moving average of ten years of earnings ad justed for inflation Market cycles are impossible to call with any precision The best we can do is use the process of elimination to identify where we are not As Howard Marks aptly put it You cant predict You can prepare2 As of today most investors are well past the pessimism and skepticism stages except for those who have been wrong the entire way up Improvement is under way There is no blood in the streets There are no babies being thrown out with the bathwater It is not the time to get greedy Do these conditions mean it is time to sell all your stocks because of the huge gains made since March 2009 Whether or not to sell depends on an investors time horizon which is the primary determinant of how risk is perceived and expe rienced The more time you have the less risk you bear Patience is a great equalizer of cycles in the financial markets Time in the markets with good businesses not timing the markets drives wealth creation This is what Peter Lynch was referring to when he said these golden words The real key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them4 Low and negativereturn years are a routine part of the investing game You have to be present in this game for a long time to win The key is to avoid getting thrown out midway because of reckless decisions We cannot control the direction of the market or what returns it will give but we can control some essential aspects of the investing process figure 231 SINVESToR KNow WHAT You ConTRoL WHAT WE yews t my Dont BEHA VIOR ae te axesy ame we Focus on ONLY Focus ON vishal

markets eventually come to an end As Buffett has said Bull markets can obscure mathematical laws but they cannot repeal them Stocks go down sharply and we experience a bear market These things are to be expected When it happens is up to Mr Market and no one else I repeat no one else A phenomenon usually holds true however before a fullblown bear market occurs it generally is preceded by a vertical market rise of significant proportions Otherwise what we experience is simply the random periodic process of corrections Intensify your research activity during times of correction as most of your demotivated competition will want to just wait it out A big bear market needs to be preceded by complete euphoria a major unexpected negative dislocation and a complete drying up of liquidity The 2008 bear market happened because financial institutions were going bankrupt The market was euphoric Indias Nifty index went up 7 between 2003 and 2007 and liquidity dried up completely credit markets froze after the collapse of Lehman Brothers How can excessive booms and busts take place so frequently in an efficient market whose primary foundation is rooted in the combined assumptions of utilitymaximizing behavior market equilibrium and stable preferences The answer is found in what Daniel Kahneman describes as the availability heuristic one of the most insidious and potent cognitive biases People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memoryand this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media Frequently mentioned topics populate the mind even as others slip away from awareness In turn what the media choose to report corresponds to their view of what is currently on the publics mind It is no acci dent that authoritarian regimes exert substantial pressure on independent media Because public interest is most easily aroused by dramatic events and by celebrities media feeding frenzies are common Availability errors are a common source of folly in human reasoning Whenever a memory turns up high in the results list of the minds search engine for reasons other than frequencybecause it is recent vivid gory distinctive or upsettingpeople tend to grossly overestimate its likelihood Because of the extreme media emphasis on either side widespread greed feeds on greed and widespread fear feeds on fear When prices move up or down sharply they tend to create selfreinforcing loops And this leads to the consequent boom andbust cycles wherein stock prices are completely dislocated from underlying business values During these times investors should always heed Buffetts advice The less prudence with which others conduct their affairs the greater the prudence with which we should conduct our own affairs He continues During such scary periods you should never forget two things First widespread fear is your friend as an investor because it serves up bargain purchases Second personal fear is your enemy emphasis added Markets oscillate between extreme optimism and pessimism which is why it is so useful to have a reverse discounted cash flow frame of mind Invert always invert Stock prices sometimes fall to such extremely low levels that the earnings of the next three to four years alone add up to the current market cap Conversely sometimes stock prices go to such extremely high levels that even a high earn ings growth rate for a decade would not produce earnings sufficient to justify a future value large enough to make a commitment today Thinking in terms of a reverse discounted cash flow analysis to evaluate stocks during such periods helps investors make better decisions Mr Market is a delightful opponent to play against because even in general market conditions he lets investors capitalize on the mispricings that result from his prejudices and constant tendency to paint all stocks within a group with the same brush In other words Mr Market often resorts to blanket categorization or what Kahneman has referred to as the unnecessary negative connotation associated with stereotyping Stereotyping is a bad word in our culture but in my usage it is neutral One of the basic characteristics of System 1 is that it repre sents categories as norms and prototypical exemplars This is how we think of horses refrigerators and New York police officers we hold in memory a representation of one or more normal members of each of these categories When the categories are social these representations are called stereotypes Some stereotypes are perniciously wrong and hostile stereotyping can have dreadful consequences but the psychological facts cannot be avoided stereotypes both correct and false are how we think of categories2 Consider the following notable examples of how biased Mr Market frequently gives patient investors many opportunities 1 Grossly undervaluing moated businesses on a longterm basis by focusing on accounting earnings instead of owner earnings and nor malized longterm earning power In these cases the economic earnings generally exceed the accounting earnings even though the ac counting PE ratio looks optically high 2 Overlooking a hidden champion that is a critical part of the value chain in a commodity industry and that consistently exhibits high gross margins that are stable over time indicating pricing power 3 Not giving the long rope to an entrepreneur whois a learning machine even after he has rectified his past mistakes and has taken a series of valuecreating initiatives 4 Totally bypassing serial acquirers as a broad category even though few companies have a proven longterm track record of successful valueaccretive MA deals 5 Completely shunning IPOs even when they pertain to great businesses being offered at cheap valuations during a bear market citing the various oftstated cons of IPOs like the timing option for the sale being in the hands of insiders the presence of many buyers and only a handful of sellers and the incentive for merchant bankers to act in the insiders best interests by managing the IPO in a way that maximizes the amount of money raised with the issuance of the fewest shares possible Some notable red flags include a company name change just before the IPO to reflect a currently fancied sector a sudden jump in sales or profitability in the year of or immediately pre ceding the IPO and inconsistent growth in prior years the primary objective of the IPO being to meet working capital requirements or the IPO being issued at peak multiples on peak earnings near the top of the industry cycle Note that IPOs of sunrise businesses that have few to no listed peers tend to command a scarcity premium 6 Exhibiting reluctance to invest in great businesses available at reasonable valuations just because they have large absolute stock prices 7 Lacking the ability to delay gratification and ending up heavily discounting the distant future cash flows of companies that currently are undergoing a large expansion program and consequently experiencing depressed reported earnings in the near term because of the sig nificant initial operating expenses incurred amid lowcapacity utilization 8 Stereotyping a promoter with an extravagant salary as unethical even though the opportunity cost of not siding with certain intelligent fanatics may be high when the various aspects specific to the investment situation at hand are considered in totality 9 Labeling an entire industry as untouchable and completely ignoring the exceptional performers within it 10 Getting confused between risk and uncertainty which results in significant mispricing in certain cases Risk is the potential for perma nent loss of capital or purchasing power whereas uncertainty refers to an unpredictable range of possible outcomes In these situations it ultimately boils down to the price Just because a companys future is highly uncertain or unknown at present this does not mean an investment in itis risky In fact some of the best investment opportunities are highly uncertain but have minimal risk of permanent capital loss 11 Throwing out the baby with the bathwater This is acommon occurrence in spinoffs and bankruptcy situations Abruptly mispriced op portunities keep arising in the financial markets from time to time Always be alert 12 Separating a given companys bonds into two bucketshigh risk and low riskbased on certain labels Sometimes a companys junior bonds are issued at a high interest rate at a time when the same entitys senior bonds are offering a low interest rate Investors should heed Grahams words of wisdom in such cases If any obligation of an enterprise deserves to qualify as a creditworthy investment then all its obligations must do so Stated conversely if a companys junior bonds are not safe its firstmortgage bonds are not creditworthy either For if the second mortgage is unsafe the company itself is weak and generally speaking there can be no creditworthy obligations ofa weak enterprise Successful investing in these various situations is all about having people agree with youlater The alignment between price and value can be greatly distorted by psychological and technical factors in the short term As Graham said In the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine Ironically to generate alpha investors need the markets to be efficient eventually The market needs to realize that it has made an error and then to correct it Otherwise mispricings would persist forever and in such a market no one could reliably outperform Market Efficiency and the Wisdom of Crowds Information is not a single big thing thats locked in a safe It exists in bits and pieces scattered around the world Everybody has a little piece of the total information available If information is widely scattered and diffuse then no single individual is going to have much information relative to the total In fact regardless of how smart or informed a person is any given individual has only a fraction of the information available to the entire market at any point in time The function of the markets is to aggregate that information evaluate it and incorporate it into prices Through the wisdom of crowds and the power of efficient markets the current price of a security swiftly re flects the markets collective assessment of the likelihood of possible plausible and probable future events To understand and appreciate the incredible informationgathering capability of the stock market study Michael Maloney and J Harold Mulherins famous case analysis titled The Complexity of Price Discovery in an Efficient Market The Stock Market Reaction to the Challenger Crash2 Dont let the mar kets become your master however a collective loss of sensibility can result when herd mentality takes over Knowing when the market is being brilliantly rational and when it is being ludicrously irrational is learned from experience and an extensive study of financial history The wisdom of crowds aggregation process in the market generates an accurate answer by transferring partial domainspecific knowledge from individuals to the collective A popular example of the wisdom of crowds phenomenon is the analysis of a 1906 ox weighing contest written by Sir Francis Galton titled Vox Populi Three key tenets of market efficiency pertain to information and the wisdom of crowds implements those tenets under six conditions For each of the following only a sufficient or threshold number of in vestors not all is required for the condition to hold 1 Dissemination Information must be available and observed 2 Processing The group must have an adequate amount of domainspecific knowledge in the form of facts or expertise the crowd must be diverse and investors must act independently 3 Information Investors should not face significant impediments to trading otherwise estimates of value will not be expressed aggregated and incorporated into the stock price and individuals must have incentives to give estimates that they believe are true When these conditions are met the crowd produces an accurate answer and it will be next to impossible for the individual to beat the collective When I read James Surowieckis book The Wisdom of Crowds finally learned to recognize the significance and deeper meaning of trading volumes When in doubt about a stock after a sudden sharp move on either side look at the volumes The collective wisdom of the market will guide you in the right direction most of the time Knowledge compounds over time As new neural connections are formed in our brains through both direct and vicarious experience a latticework of mental models starts to develop Keep learning every day to con stantly nurture and nourish this vibrant latticework You never know when you will experience a big eureka moment Always note such findings immediately You may not be able to recall them at a later date Any one of these findings could help you earn handsome profits during a sudden fortunate phase in your investing journey Continuously work toward creating opportunities for serendipity to find you at the unlikeliest of times and places in your life CHAPTER 24 THE DYNAMIC ART OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND INDIVIDUAL POSITION SIZING Diversification is the best way to admit you have no idea whats going to happen in the future Its how you prepare a portfolio for a wide range of future possibilities and admit your own infallibility Ben Carlson however is that all you are doing in this case is swapping one type of risk for another You are exchanging companyspecific risk unsystematic risk which may be quite low depending on the type of company in which you invest for market risk system atic risk Risk hasnt been reduced it simply has been transferred from one form to another Diversification of investments is touted as reducing both risk and volatility Although a diversified portfolio indeed may reduce your overall level of risk it also may correspondingly reduce your potential level of reward The more extensively diversified an investment portfolio the greater the likelihood is that it at best M any articles books and white papers on investing recommend having a highly diversified investment portfolio The reality mirrors the performance of the overall market Because many investors aim for betterthanmarketaverage investment returns it is important to have a clear understanding of diversification versus concentration in portfolio choices Some level of diversification should be considered in constructing an investment portfolio but it should not be the main driver The primary focus of an investment operation should always be on putting together a port folio that is best suited to meet the personal life goals and financial needs of the individual The only benchmark any investor should care about is whether theyre on track to reach the goals they set up their portfolio to achieve in the first place From my readings over the years Thave gleaned the following thoughts about diversification versus concentrationt Overdiversification tends to result in mediocre performance The academics have done a terrible disservice to intelligent investors by glorifying the idea of diversification Because Ijust think the whole concept is literally almost insane It emphasizes feeling good about not having your investment results depart very much from average investment results Charlie Munger The appeal of a concentrated portfolio is that it is the only chance an investor has to beat the averages by a noteworthy margin Frank Martin because the benefits of diversification start diminishing beyond a certain point Statistical analysis shows that securityspecific risk is adequately diversified after fourteen names in different industries and the incremental benefit of each additional holding is negligible Mason Hawkins Two things should be remembered after purchasing six or eight stocks in different industries the benefit of adding even more stocks to your portfolio in an effort to decrease risk is small and overall market risk will not be eliminated merely by adding more stocks to your portfolio Joel Greenblatt Idecided to run a concentrated portfolio As Joel Greenblatt pointed out holding eight stocks eliminates 81 percent of the risk in owning just one stock and holding thirtytwo stocks eliminates 96 percent of the risk This insight struck me as incredibly impor tant David Einhorn Great ideas are rare The idea that it is hard to find good investments so concentrate in a few seems to me to be an obviously good idea But ninetyeight percent of the investment world doesnt think this way Charlie Munger In the field of common stocks a little bit of a great many can never be more than a poor substitute for a few of the outstanding Phil Fisher so focus and concentrate in your best ideas Phil Fisher believed in concentrating in about ten good investments and was happy with a limited number That is very much in our playbook And he believed in knowing a lot about the things he did invest in And thats in our playbook too And the reason why its in our playbook is that to some extent we learned it from him Charlie Munger We believe that a policy of portfolio concentration may well decrease risk if it raises as it should both the intensity with which an investor thinks about a business and the comfortlevel he must feel with its economic characteristics before buying into it Warren Buffett Avoid excessive diversification For individuals any holding of over twenty different stocks is a sign of financial incompetence Phil Fisher because risk lies in not knowing what you are doing As time goes on I get more and more convinced that the right method in investment is to put fairly large sums into enterprises which one thinks one knows something about and in the management of which one thoroughly believes It is a mistake to think that one limits ones risk by spreading too much between enterprises about which one knows little and has no reason for special confidence John Maynard Keynes The desire to spread stock picking risks over a number of different securities must be balanced against the negative impacts of spreading research resources so thin that an intimate understanding of a company or industry is lost In such cases diversification can become diworseification Lee Ainslie Avoid extreme concentration like Buffett and Munger unless you have very high expertise If you can identify six wonderful businesses that is all the diversification you need And you will make a lot of money And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead of putting more money into your first one is gotta be a terrible mistake Very few people have gotten rich on their seventh best idea Warren Buffett A welldiversified portfolio needs just four stocks Charlie Munger instead practice sufficient diversification For an individual investor you want to own at least ten and probably fifteen and as many as twenty different securities Many people would consider that to be a relatively highly concentrated portfolio In our view you want to own the best ten or fifteen businesses you can find and if you invest in low leveragehighquality companies thats a comfortable degree of diversification Bill Ackman and structure a concentrated yet diverse portfolio in terms of risk exposures Most investors think diversification consists of holding many different things few understand that diversification is effective only if portfolio holdings can be counted on to respond differently to a given development in the environment Howard Marks If each of our holdings turned out to involve similar bets inflation hedges interest rate sensitive single market or asset type etc we would be exposed to dramatic and sudden reversals in our entire portfolio were investor perceptions of the macro environment to change Since we are not able to predict the future we cannot risk such concentrations Seth Klarman In May 1938 John Maynard Keynes outlined his investment policy in a memo distributed to the Estates Committee of Kings Col lege Cambridge 1 a careful selection of a few investments or a few types of investment having regard to their cheapness in relation to their probable actual and potential intrinsic value over a period of years ahead and in relation to alternative investments at the time 2 a steadfast holding of these in fairly large units through thick and thin perhaps for several years until either they have fulfilled their prom ise or it is evident that they were purchased on a mistake and 3 a balanced investment position ie a variety of risks in spite of individual holdings being large and if possible opposed risks In September 2006 Howard Marks wrote a memo entitled Dare to Be Great in which he praised a quote from the book Pioneering Portfolio Management by David Swensen Yale Universitys longtime chief investment officer Establishing and maintaining an uncon ventional investment profile requires acceptance of uncomfortably idiosyncratic portfolios which frequently appear downright impru dent in the eyes of conventional wisdom Warren Buffetts treatise on portfolio management in his January 1966 partnership letter is a tour de force on the subject The Babe Ruth Effect According to the late management guru Peter Drucker Efficiency is doing things right effectiveness is doing the right things In invest ing the latter refers to picking the right stock and the former refers to appropriate allocation Anyone can identify a winning stock but the great investors differentiate themselves through superior individual position sizing Given that the average success rate of an invest ment idea is less than 50 percent even for the best investors it really does matter that when you win you make it count When you find a great idea buy enough of it to make a meaningful difference to your life Successful investing is not only about being right per sefar from it Success in investing boils down to how the great ideas are executed that is initial allocation and subsequent pyramiding It is not the frequency of winning that matters but the frequency times the magnitude of the payoff Michael Mauboussin calls this the Babe Ruth effect It is what George Soros was referring to when he said Its not whether youre right or wrong thats important but how much money you make when youre right and how much you lose when youre wrong How can we inculcate this expected value way of thinking in our investment decisionmaking Take the probability of loss times the amount of possible loss from the probability of gain times the amount of possible gain That is what were trying to do Its imperfect but thats what its all about Warren Buffett The stock market is a parimutuel system Participants place their bets and the odds change based on these bets Therefore the only way to consistently outperform the market is to evaluate better than other investors the probabilities that market participants assign to potential outcomes The key to successful investing is to explicitly distinguish between fundamentals ie the intrinsic value of the company based on expected future results and market expectations ie the stock price and the future results it currently is factoring in Investing is all about expectations and the outcomes are driven by revisions in expectations which trigger changes in the stock price Therefore the ability to properly read market expectations and anticipate revisions of those expectations is the springboard for superior returns To do this successfully an investor needs to have variant perception that is one must hold a wellfounded view that is meaningfully different from the market consensus One of the most satisfying moments in investing is when the world looks at a business the same way you did three or four years earlier Charlie Munger drew an analogy between investing and a parimutuel betting system in his 2003 University of California Santa Barbara lecture To us investing is the equivalent of going out and betting against the parimutuel system We look for a horse with one chance in two of winning and which pays you three to one Youre looking for a mispriced gamble Thats what investing is And you have to know enough to know whether the gamble is mispriced Thats value investing The key investing lesson from the parimutuel system is to make a few large bets infrequently Investors should adhere to Mungers simple but profound advice Look at lots of deals Dont do almost all of them Ina 1994 lecture titled A Lesson on Elementary Worldly Wisdom as It Relates to Investment Management and Business Munger said Its not given to human beings to have such talent that they can just know everything about everything all the time But it is given to human beings who work hard at itwho look and sift the world for a mispriced betthat they can occasionally find one And the wise ones bet heavily when the world offers them that opportunity They bet big when they have the odds And the rest of the time they dont emphasis added Its just that simple But how can investors determine the optimal size of the individual bet The Kelly criterion gives us the answer The Kelly Criterion Formulated by John L Kelly and popularized by the practical success of Ed Thorp the Kelly criterion is a formula used to determine the optimal bet size for a given set of probabilities and payoffs Although the formula can be stated in several ways the following expanded version appeared in Thorps interview in the book Hedge Fund Market Wizards FPPW L where F Kelly criterion fraction of capital to bet Py probability of winning the bet P probability of losing the bet W dollars won if bet is won and L dollars lost if bet is lost Ifan individual knows the odds and payouts of a given bet with precision the Kelly criterion bet size will maximize capital over the long run A key difficulty however is that people dont get precise odds and only in the rare special situation or arbitrage do they obtain a reasonable picture of the payout Another hurdle is that when utilizing Kelly the long run is based on the number of events not ona time frame An investor who bets infrequently will have trouble making enough investments to get the full longterm benefits of applying Kelly Another key limitation is that people tend to underestimate the role of infrequent highimpact events or Talebs black swans The probability and downside magnitude of negative black swans may not be given the necessary consideration when investors look to apply the Kelly criterion and thus the formula when applied by the human mind may tend to overestimate F And continual overestimation leads to ruin Anything above the optimal bet size will lead to total loss sooner or later Despite the practical difficulties and impediments in its application to realworld investing the underlying logic behind the Kelly criterion is highly beneficial as a way to think about whether to establish a position in a given situation and if one is to be established what proportion of capital should be invested in that position I size individual allocations in my portfolio according to my evaluation of potential risk with the largest holdings having the lowest likelihood of permanent capital loss coupled with aboveaverage return potential initiate new positions with a minimum weighting of 5 percent and subsequently average upward if the management executes above my expectations Individual position sizing is important not only for its impact on overall portfolio performance but also for mental peace of mind I sell down to my sleeping point if an individual position becomes a discomfortingly large percentage of my portfolio value Always have bigger weights in businesses with high longevity solid growth prospects and disciplined capital allocators As Mae West said Too much of a good thing can be wonderful Our constant focus as investors should be on increasing the intrinsic value of our portfolio and letting the market give us gains according to its own schedule If we are patient we eventually will get rewarded because financial markets ultimately take money away from mediocre and stagnant businesses and redirect it toward growing profitable ones Money never sleeps Every crisis brings an op portunity We have a better way to look at the world and to think deeply about our investments This is the glasshalffull approach and it comes from a basic understanding of how capitalism functions Every bust in one area of the market establishes the foundations for a boom in another Every companys rising cost is another companys rising revenue every companys declining revenue is another com panys declining cost The best part is that the stock market usually does an excellent job of recognizing the beneficiaries in each situation by sending their stocks to the fiftytwoweekhigh list Money has a metaphysicallike attraction to places of its best possible use This is one of the powerful correcting forces of capitalism Take advantage of it We should not aim for the highest possible returns in the shortest period of time but rather we should seek aboveaverage returns over a long period of time with the lowest possible risk Risk management should take a higher precedence in the investment process and riskadjusted returns are a far superior indicator of performance than absolute returns This is especially true during bull markets when aggressive risk taking often is mistaken for intelligence Whats important is the underlying process used by the fund manager or invest ment advisory firm and the amount of risk taken on in client portfolios to achieve those high returns That process is the key to longterm sustainability High absolute returns in isolation carry little significance for assessing performance A bull market hides many mistakes As Humphrey Neill said Dont confuse brains with a bull market For example during a bull market year like 2017 if I made money on faulty picks like Lasa Supergenerics and White Organic does that mean that I was smart No Making money ona stock is not the same as being right A bull market inculcates many bad habits in investors The hard lessons are learned in the subsequent bear market For instance the perceived importance of being in the hands of good management diminishes in a bull market and increases manifold in a bearish market during the flight to quality When a sector or a stock is in high demand few in vestors care about the managements integrityfor which such individuals eventually pay the price when market conditions deteriorate A bear market typically culminates with a plethora of frauds and scams which at times are discovered to have been committed even by some erstwhile bluechip names Ina bull market no price is too high and investors seem to get a kick out of buying stocks at inflated prices But in an uncertain market they fuss about return ratios cash flows balance sheet quality management integrity and business models Few earn alpha in bear markets whereas all earn beta in bull markets When profits pile up in a bull market its easy to assume that our analytical skills are responsible The wise investor however knows the danger of hubris and graciously gives the bull market most of the credit for this per formance I humbly acknowledge that my personal portfolio benefited greatly from the strong performance of the Indian equity markets from 2014 to 2017 If we continue to earn aboveaverage returns over long periods of time and avoid permanent loss of capital in bear markets the magic of longterm compounding ultimately will take care of the outcome Develop a Sound Process and Remain Faithful to Your Personal Philosophy The best longterm performers in any probabilistic field including investing always emphasize process over outcome An investment process is a set of guidelines that governs the behavior of investors in a way that allows them to remain faithful to the tenets of their per sonal philosophy An intellectually sound and welldefined investment process helps investors stay the course during periods of underper formance or selfdoubt and improves their chances of making prudent decisions with greater consistency across a full market cycle Deserved success comes when a sound process results in a favorable outcome Poetic justice is served when a bad process is accom panied by an unfavorable outcome Luck is a major contributor in the short term To sustain high returns requires more than luck how ever and over the long term skill becomes the dominant factor According to Michael Mauboussin The key is this idea called the paradox of skill As people become better at an activity the difference between the best and the average and the best and the worst becomes much narrower As people become more skillful luck becomes more important Thats precisely what happens in the world of investing The reason that luck is so important isnt that investing skill isnt relevant Its that skill is very high and consistent That said over longer periods skill has a much better chance of shining through Inthe short term you may experience good or bad luck and that can overwhelm skill but in the longterm luck tends to even out and skill determines results The investment industry is obsessed with outcomes in the short term over which one has no direct control A sound process can occasionally generate poor results bad luck just as a bad process can occasionally generate superior results dumb luck During periods of poor performance the pressure always builds to alter ones investment philosophy An investment philosophy however is something that is gradually built over time We cannot control the movement of the markets any more than we can control the returns We can however always derive a great deal of intellectual satisfaction from following a sound process and staying true to our personal investment philosophy To make money we need luck To create wealth we need consistency Any investment strategy however sound will have pe riodic phases of underperformance The solution is not to keep changing the strategy but rather to stick to it with the understanding that discipline is the price to be paid for longterm outperformance Compounding is a lifelong journey and an individuals impatience with his or her investment process could lead to a fatal decision and bring the journey to an abrupt end Stay the course and remain faithful to your personal investment philosophy and your individual process Focus is the key to success Successful investors identify their niches and stick to them gradually evolving over time as they learn and adapt As Munger says All intelligent investing is value investing And value investors do not equate risk with random fluctuations of stock prices nor do they equate high risk with high return Instead they always think in terms of the positive relationship between intelligent effort and return As Graham espoused in The Intelligent Investor It has been an old and sound principle that those who cannot afford to take risks should be content with a relatively low return on their invested funds From this there has developed the general notion that the rate of return which the investor should aim for is more or less proportionate to the degree of risk he is ready to run Our view is different The rate of return sought should be dependent rather on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is willing and able to bring to bear on his task emphasis added CHAPTER 25 TO FINISH FIRST YOU MUST FIRST FINISH If we cant tolerate a possible consequence remote though it may be we steer clear of planting its seeds Warren Buffett The worst case is far more consequential than the forecast itself This is particularly true if the bad scenario is not acceptable Yet the current phraseology makes no allowance for that None Nassim Nicholas Taleb All I want to know is where Im going to die so Ill never go there Charlie Munger There are old investors and there are bold investors but there are no old bold investors Howard Marks he following is an excerpt from the Life and Debt section of Warren Buffetts 2010 letter wherein he talks about the significance of liquidity and the perils of leverage The fundamental principle of auto racing is that to finish first you must first finish That dictum is equally applicable to business and guides our every action at Berkshire Unquestionably some people have become very rich through the use of borrowed money However thats also been a way to get very poor When leverage works it magnifies your gains Your spouse thinks youre clever and your neighbors get envious But leverage is addictive Once having profited from its wonders very few people retreat to more conservative practices And as we all learned in third gradeand some relearned in 2008any series of positive numbers however impressive the numbers may be evapo rates when multiplied by a single zero History tells us that leverage all too often produces zeroes even when it is employed by very smart people Leverage of course can be lethal to businesses as well Companies with large debts often assume that these obligations can be refinanced as they mature That assumption is usually valid Occasionally though either because of companyspecific problems or a worldwide shortage of credit maturities must actually be met by payment For that only cash will do the job Borrowers then learn that credit is like oxygen When either is abundant its presence goes unnoticed When either is missing thats all that is noticed Even a short absence of credit can bring a company to its kneesemphasis added Moreover during the episodes of financial chaos that occasionally erupt in our economy we will be equipped both finan cially and emotionally to play offense while others scramble for survival Thats what allowed us to invest 156 billion in 25 days of panic following the Lehman bankruptcy in 20082 Cash is a call option on opportunity Having ample liquid cash puts a valuable optionality in the hands of investors to make bargain purchases when opportunities arise and it also makes them antifragile Cash is a muchunderappreciated asset Its one of the only price stable assets that is simultaneously highly valueelastic cash increases in value as other asset prices drop The more they drop the more valuable cash becomes Conversely if you are forced to sell assets in a market with a small number of buyers you may end up taking large haircuts This is especially true in markets for illiquid stocks luxury items and other esoteric assets such as art wine and so on So how do you prevent this from happening to you Have ample liquidity cash reserves so that you arent forced to sell assets during periods of market turbulence and sharp drawdowns Create an emergency fund equal to two years of living expenses and gradually increase it to five years as you increase your exposure to equities over time If you need to spend money and you cant that is risk Nothing is worse for an investor than selling an asset at rockbottom prices to get cash for essential purchases This is the key differentiator be tween those who grow rich and those who dontthe rich invest in assets that generate recurring cash flow for them To get a more holistic understanding of what risk really means we need to add the elements of time and expected future liabilities to the traditional definition of risk the chance of losing money Risk and time are opposite sides of the same coin for if there were no tomorrow there would be no risk Time transforms risk and the nature of risk is shaped by the time horizon emphasis added the future is the playing field Peter Bernstein Any definition of risk must include a time horizon or it is incomplete The time horizon changes how you perceive and experience risk The more time you have the less risk you bear For example the SP 500 is typically more volatile over a oneyear period than any longterm US Treasury bond but over any historical thirtyyear period the SP 500 is far less risky For all thirtyyear periods for which we have data the SP 500 has outperformed US tenyear Treasury bonds In his blog Nick Maggiulli talks about an equation for how we should think about our ability to take risk Ability to Take Risk Assets Liabilities Time Having more assets fewer future liabilities and more time all increase your ability to take risk emphasis added You cant control the amount of time you have however time provides the opportunity to recoup losses so more is better2 Ina similar vein Morgan Housel writes The most important question to ask when thinking about risk isnt how much volatility or upside youre looking for but how much time your emotions and goals need for that volatility to play out emphasis added If you borrow money to buy stocks or if you run an openended fund with a daily or weekly redemption option or if your personal temperament is not suited to longterm thinking then for you volatility is equal to risk Focus on Consequences Not Just Raw Probabilities Whenever a really bright person who has a lot of money goes broke its because of leverage Warren Buffett When making critical decisions we should focus on both the frequency and the magnitude of the consequences Because we tend not to do so rare and implausible events frequently are grossly mispriced Prudent individuals define risk management as a process of deal ing with the potential consequences of being wrong In 2007 Buffett gave a talk to a group of MBA students at the University of Florida wherein he shared his thoughts on the collapse of the hedge fund LongTerm Capital Management LTCM To make money they didnt have and didnt need they risked what they did have and did need and thats foolish That is just plain fool ish Doesnt make any difference what your IQ is If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you it just does not make any sense I dont care whether the odds are 100 to one that you succeed or 1000 to one that you suc ceed If you hand me a gun with a thousand chambersa million chambers in itand theres a bullet in one chamber and you said Put it up to your temple how much do you want to be paid to pull it once Im not going to pull it You can name any sum you want but it doesnt do anything for me on the upside and I think the downside is fairly clear Laughter So Im not interested in that kind of a game And yet people do it financially without thinking about it very much emphasis added Life business and investing are games of probabilities and almost all probabilities are less than 100 percent So you are going to be wrong and lose sometimes even when the odds are in your favor As Peter Bernstein says You just have to be prepared to be wrong and understand that your ego had better not depend on being proven right Being wrong is part of the process Survival is the only road to riches5 Always be aware of the potential downside If the consequence of an action is not acceptable to us then no matter how low the probability we must avoid that action If bankruptcy death or loss of reputation are one of the potential downside risks then it doesnt really matter what the various upside possibilities are because they become totally irrelevant Certain bets in life regardless of how asym metric they may appear should be avoided by any prudent individual The key to longterm survival is planning your life to prepare for the odds of bad luck which in turn requires a strategic focus on diversification room for error and avoiding single points of failure partic ularly big noninsurable risks It is fine to trust our intuition on the small decisions but we should always carefully think through the big decisions in our lives to avoid potentially fatal mistakes This is why Buffett says We dont have to be smarter than the rest We have to be more disciplined than the rest Apeaceful nights sleep and assured survival is much more important than higher relative returns for ones overall wellbeing Charlie and I believe in operating with many redundant layers of liquidity and we avoid any sort of obligation that could drain our cash in a material way That reduces our returns in 99 years out of 100 But we will survive in the 100th while many others fail em phasis added And we will sleep well in all 100 Warren Buffett Asan investor how can you be best prepared to survive the inevitable periodic severe corrections and bear markets during your lifetime Ensure that you have tennis balls highquality businesses in your portfolio and not eggs bad quality junk stocks that will splatter after hitting the floor In a market crash both quality and junk fall Quality eventually rises again and junk never recovers Many individuals make large paper fortunes in bull markets but lose all of it when the bear market eventually arrives How much you are able to retain after the recovery from a bear market is far more important than how much paper profit you make during a bull market And qual ity of business matters the most in retaining longterm wealth Amarket always exists for the best of anything because people who appreciate quality always seem to have money This is as true of stocks and bonds as it is of real estate and antiques Once you have achieved financial independence it is important to realign your portfo lio to have the majority weight in highquality businesses After reaching a state of financial prosperity in life ensure that you take all nec essary steps to avoid being thrown back to the starting position Achieving success and then losing everything has a far greater emotional impact than failing before ever having achieved success Owners of outstanding businesses sleep better at night Quality of the business and integrity of the management matter the most in creating and much more important in retaining the hardearned longterm wealth This is precisely why the handful of highquality secular growth businesses in any stock market deservedly enjoy a scarcity premium and tend to trade at rich valuations for long periods of time Ilimit secondline stocks to less than 20 percent of my portfolio Having been around in the markets for more than a decade I have seen plenty of rising stars vanish without a trace The returns from triedandtested frontline stocks may not be spectacular but over longer periods of time they tend to be more consistent and reliable The key to a lifetime of investment success is not to make brilliant or complex decisions but to avoid doing foolish things People are trying to be smartall I am trying to do is not to be idiotic but its harder than most people think emphasis added Charlie Munger You Only Have to Get Rich Once Having a large amount of leverage is like driving a car with a dagger on the steering wheel pointed at your heart If you do that you will be a better driver There will be fewer accidents but when they happen they will be fatal emphasis added Warren Buffett During his LTCM speech at the University of Florida Buffett highlighted how reliance on only the documented past leads to blind spots and neglect of total exposure Its produced by an overrelianceon thingsthose guys would tell mea six sigma event wouldnt touch usbut they were istory does not tell you the probabilities of future financial things happening The same thing in a different way could happen to any of uswhere we really have a blind spot about something thats crucial because we know a whole lot about some thing else Henry Kaufman had once saidthe people who are going broke in this situation are of two types the ones who knew nothing and the ones that knew everything At the 2006 Berkshire annual meeting when asked about Berkshires next chief investment officer Buffett said Imentioned in the annual report that in looking for an investment manager to succeed me were looking for someone who doesnt only learn from things that have happened but can also envision things that have never happened This is our job in insurance and investments Many people are very smart but are not wired to think about things that havent happened before emphasis added Anything times zero is zero and I dont care how good the record is in every other year if one year theres a zero Were look ing for someone who is wired in such a way as to see risks that havent occurred and be cognizant of risks that have occurred Charlie and I have seen guys go broke or close to it because 99 of 100 of their decisions were good but the 100th did them in Daily decisions fall into one of the following three categories 1 Outcomes are known In this case the range of outcomes is known and the individual outcome is also known This is the easiest way to make decisions 2 Outcomes are unknown but probabilities are known In this case the range of outcomes is known but the individual outcome is un known This is risk Think of this as gambling in Vegas where all of the outcomes at the table are known as are the probabilities of each 3 Outcomes are unknown and probabilities are unknown In this case the distribution of outcomes is unknown and so are the individual outcomes This is uncertainty This is where black swans reside We behave in accordance with our embedded belief that we are making decisions in option number 2 We are prepared for a world much like number 2a world with known outcomes and probabilities that can be estimated Yet we live in a world that starkly resembles option number 3 Welcome to the World of Extremistan Extreme events are where ruin is found Its also true that these extreme changes in securities prices may be much greater than you would expect from the Gaussian or normal statistics commonly used Edward Thorp The devil is in the residuals as all of us have discovered to our sorrow Howard Marks According to Nassim Nicholas Taleb the world could be divided into the safe and comfortable Mediocristan and the unsafe and seemingly improbable Extremistan In Mediocristan nothing is scalable everything is constrained by boundary conditions time the limits of bio logical variation and the limits of hourly compensation Because of such constraints and the limits of our knowledge random variation of attributes exists in Mediocristan and can be usefully described by Gaussian probability models ie the bell curve or other distributions having a family resemblance to it In Extremistan variation within distributions is far less constrained than in Mediocristan It is the land of scalability and power laws Generators of events produce distributions with large or small extreme values frequently Those extreme values affect the sum of attribute values in a sample distribution and the mean value of such distributions The probability of occurrence of extreme values varies greatly from Gaussian models In fact many attribute value distributions in Extremistan do not fit any known models well Examples in clude everything from sales distributions for books per author to wealth and income distributions for individuals and businesses According to Sebastian Mallaby In the early 1960s a maverick mathematician named Benoit Mandelbrot argued that the tails of the distribution might be fatter than the normal bell curve assumed and Eugene Fama the father of efficientmarket theory who got to know Mandelbrot at the time conducted tests on stockprice changes that confirmed Mandelbrots assertion If price changes had been normally distrib uted jumps greater than five standard deviations should have shown up in a daily price data about once every seven thousand years Instead they cropped up about once every three to four years emphasis added2 Benoit Mandelbrot was a Polishborn mathematician and polymath who developed a new branch of mathematics known as fractal geometry which recognizes the hidden order in the seemingly disordered the plan in the unplanned the regular pattern in the irregular ity of nature Mandelbrot found that the underlying power law that was evident in random patterns in nature also applies to the positive and negative price movements of many financial instruments The movement of stock prices followed a power law rather than a Gaussian or normal distribution In his book The MisBehavior of Markets written with Richard Hudson Mandelbrot invoked the important concept of clustering Market turbulence tends to cluster This is no surprise to an experienced trader They also know that is in those wildest moments the rare but recurring crisis of the financial worldwhere the biggest fortunes of Wall Street are made and lost Periods of big price changes groups together interspersed by intervals of more sedate variationthe telltale marks of long memory and persistence It shows scaling Large price changes tend to be followed by more large price changes positive or negative Small changes tend to be followed by more small changes Volatility clusters emphasis added Clustering as a concept resembles the Pareto principle which states that for many events 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes The clustering phenomenon has important implications for investors Market returns are largely clustered followed by long periods of a ranged move Volatility is often the greatest at turning points diminishing as a new trend becomes established Patience is extremely important Beyond a certain point on a larger portfolio size com pounding becomes powerful Longterm survival ensures a high probability of making money Within our portfolio returns are clustered A few stocks account for the bulk of the returns Appropriate allocation is the key to generating better returns While studying an investment idea our research efforts are clustered A small fraction of the information and analysis determines the action on an idea Valuation clusters We spend large amounts of time either in overvaluation or in undervaluation We only briefly experience extreme undervaluation or extreme overvaluation and rarely experience fair valuation Good news tends to cluster and so too does bad news Watch for any sharp move whether in margins insider ownership trading volumes for a stock capital work in progress figure on the balance sheet or other related areas Such clustering raises many interesting ideas Companies coming out of prolonged periods of trouble could experience clusters of improving performance Similarly companies with prolonged periods of strong performance could experience clusters of deteriorating performance The inaugural edition of Security Analysis had as a frontispiece a quote from Horaces Ars Poetica that best sums up the essence of market cycles and sector leaders and laggards in bull and bear markets Many shall be restored that now are fallen and many shall fall that now are in honor Risk is whats left over after youve thought of everything possible plausible and probable The human minds tendency to com pletely discount six sigma and other rare events from the realm of possibility is what Taleb warns about in his book The Black Swan We need to avoid clamoring for precise singlepoint predictions and instead stresstest our portfolio under a wider and darker range of what if scenarios and outcomes When we humbly accept that its difficult to make predictions especially about the future we will be more inclined to build an investment strategy that is robust to a wide range of outcomes Forewarned is forearmed The world we live in is simply too complex In other words we simply have too many unknown unknowns No one is alone in this world No act is without conse quences According to chaos theory in dynamical systems the outcome of any process is sensitive to its starting pointor in the famous cliché the flap of a butterflys wings in the Amazon can cause a tornado in Texas In such a world events in the distant past continue to echo in the present path dependence Or as Taleb would say we live primarily in an Extremistan world one that is full of feedback loops is filled with interdependence and thus is black swanridden Talebs black swan theory refers to unexpected events of large magnitude and consequences and their dominant role in history These events are the very reason for Vladimir Lenins saying There are decades where nothing happens and there are weeks where decades happen Here is my exhaustive list of black swan risks for the coming year This list will always be empty because you cant predict a black swan event A black swan is something that comes as a complete surprise to everyone Its a risk that is unforeseen therefore by definition it cannot be predicted such events considered extreme outliers collectively play vastly larger roles than regular occurrences We all contemplate and un derstand the things that happen within three standard deviations but everything important in financial history takes place outside those three standard deviations Still many smart people do not consider these kinds of rare events to be even remotely plausible In addition complex mathematical models that can purportedly manage fattail risks create the illusion of control Consequently these people express this overconfidence in their beliefs by betting the entire house on their preferred bet and piling up tons of leverage Ultimately this blind reliance on only the documented past leads to ruin Failure often comes from a failure to imagine failure History teaches us that a crisis often causes problems to correlate in a manner undreamed of in more tranquil times Linkage when it suddenly surfaces can trigger serious systemic problems emphasis added Warren Buffett Never bet your entire capital on a single stock or sector Even if you hold stocks from different industries diversify thoughtfully to ensure that they are not vulnerable to a cascading impact from any one single event or common factor such as all of them having opera tions in a common city or state or any other commonrisk concentration factors Statistically any investment opportunity can appear to be attractive but statistics by definition apply to a group The bigger the sample size the higher the statistical significance of the pattern observed By putting all our money on an almost sureshot bet we could end up making a fatal financial mistake Howard Marks shared a story about a gambler who bet everything on a race with only one horse in it How could he lose Halfway around the track the horse jumped over the fence and ran away Invariably things can get worse than people expect Maybe worst case means the worst weve seen in the past But that doesnt mean things cant be worse in the future2 This story has a valuable lesson for investors Never bet the farm ona single investment no matter how certain you are of the outcome You never know when luck will hand you the equivalent of a crazy horse Risk often originates from sources you cant imagine Avoid going crazy with concentration Instead diversify prudently As Buffett puts it If significant risk exists in a single transaction overall risk should be reduced by making that purchase one of many mutually independent commitments Thus you may consciously purchase a risky investmentone that indeed has a significant possibil ity of causing loss or injuryif you believe that your gain weighted for probabilities considerably exceeds your loss comparably weighted and if you can commit to a number of similar but unrelated opportunities Most venture capitalists employ this strategy Should you choose to pursue this course you should adopt the outlook of the casino that owns a roulette wheel which will want to see lots of action because it is favored by probabilities but will refuse to accept a single huge bet2 The biggest risks are those that arent in the news People dont prepare for them because theyre not being reported Risk is always present but we tend to become blind to it in bull markets People forget that risk in the markets is never eliminated it is only transferred from one person to another or converted from one form to another In turbulent times it pays to be a student of human behavior during similar chaotic situations in history History is mostly the study of unprecedented events ironically used as a map of the future Stuff evolves tastes change paradigms shift So what worked in the past may not work today or tomorrow The most valuable part of history is studying how people behaved when something unprecedented happened Its the most consistent thing over time emphasis added Morgan Housel Recency bias is allpervasive We tend to extrapolate recent trends into infinity as we assume them to reflect the new normal Until it isnt normal in a cyclical world figures 251a and 251b a b aaa wie Feom bs Nor 2 Vv Figure 251 a Abrupt volatility is the norm in life and b financial markets Source Behavior Gap If a quantitative trading strategy works consistently for an initial period it tends to become widespread In 1998 it was conver gence arbitrage LTCM assumed that historical patterns in the relationship of certain assets would persist forever and leveraged its posi tions by more than 25 to 1 When those patterns changed for just a brief period LTCM blew up In 2017 the SP 500 did not have a 5 percent drawdown even once and volatility was nearly nonexistent But as economist Hyman Minsky said in the financial markets stability often breeds instability Tranquil environments tend to lull us into a state of utter complacency and set us up for some nasty surprises On February 5 2018 volatility measured by the CBOE VIX also known as the Fear Index on Wall Street suddenly exploded a record 118 percent in a single day to the highest levels since the Lehman Brothers crisis This event was accompanied by an intraday fall of nearly 1600 points the largest in the history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average The most notable casualty of this episode was Credit Su isses VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX ShortTerm exchangetraded note ETN or XIV for short The product managed by Credit Suisse which owned 32 percent of the note shorted volatility by betting on calm market condi tions and it had increased in popularity over the past year as volatility in the markets reached historic lows As the VIX shot through the roof the XIV plunged 92 percent in a single day It took six years for XIV to go from 11 to 144 and just one day for it to implode to nearly zerosix years of picking up pennies in front of a bulldozer wiped away in a single session XIV had been marketed exclusively to profes sional investors and it stayed true to the promise made on page 197 of its prospectus The long term expected value of your ETNs is zero If you hold your ETNs as a longterm investment it is likely you will lose all or a substantial portion of your investment4 The ensuing negative feedback loop of selling is believed to have exacerbated the market turmoil on that particular day These kinds of devastating events can occur in the market at any time and they will happen again without any warning You should expect the un expected in this business expect the extreme Dont think in terms of boundaries that limit what the market might do One of the single biggest realizations I have experienced in this business is that the unexpected and seemingly impossible continue to happen This is why reading history and studying human behavior during past episodes of panic is valuable for an investor The events of the week of February 5 to February 9 2018 were eerily similar to those described in the chapter titled Market Fluctuations in John Brookss classic Business Ad ventures As Mark Twain rightly said History doesnt repeat itself but it often rhymes Never Depend on the Kindness of Strangers In his 2008 letter Buffett said We never want to count on the kindness of strangers in order to meet tomorrows obligations5 Certain businesses are inherently vulnerable because of their constant dependence on the kindness of strangers for their ongoing survival Examples include lending businesses with low intrinsic return on equity which need to tap the capital markets frequently to raise the money that is their raw material as well as highly capitalintensive negativefreecashflow companies which require constant external funding Levered institutions that depend on capital and trust are always susceptible to speculation and selffulfilling prophe cies In 1948 famed sociologist Robert K Merton coined the term selffulfilling prophecy The selffulfilling prophecy is in the be ginning a false definition of the situation evoking a new behavior which makes the original false conception come true In other words saying it can make it so A public pronouncement might lead others to act in a way that will lead that pronouncement to be true even if theres no basis in fact In financial markets that is often the case Investors need to consider these aspects when evaluating the appropriate valuation for individual businesses For example unlike banks which generally have a sticky deposit base microfinance companies always depend on funds from the credit markets which tum hostile as soon as an adverse business event could affect collections from borrowers Add to this the everpresent political risks to which they are subject and the unsecured nature of their lending and it is clear why microfinance businesses should be accorded a lower valua tion than banks with comparable return ratios and asset quality A similar principle applies to businesses that depend on the kindness of one or two primary clients The pricing power goes away if customers know that they are critical to the companys survival Businesses with excessive customer concentration generally do not get a high valuation multiple Investors should study what happened to RS Soft ware India which used to get about 85 percent of its revenues from Visa Many of lifes most important lessons are learned the hard way One lesson is about the lure of greed in a bull market and the subse quent perils of leverage Raymond DeVoe Jr has rightly said More money has been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun5 Buffett has often said that if you are smart you dont need leverage and if you are dumb you have no business using it In his 2017 letter he made a strong argument against using borrowed money to buy stocks There is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period Even if your borrowings are small and your positions arent immediately threatened by the plunging market your mind may well become rattled by scary headlines and breathless commentary And an unsettled mind will not make good decisions2 Cultivate Staying Power to Mitigate the Risk of Ruin Time is the best test of fragilityit encompasses high doses of disorderand nature is the only system that has been stamped robust by time Time is an eraser rather than a builder and a good one at breaking the fragilewhether buildings or ideas wNassim Nicholas Taleb In his 2014 letter Buffett shared the characteristics of companies with staying power Financial staying power requires a company to maintain three strengths under all circumstances 1 a large and reliable stream of earnings 2 massive liquid assets and 3 no significant nearterm cash requirements Ignoring that last necessity is what usually leads companies to experience unexpected problems Too often CEOs of profitable companies feel they will always be able to refund maturing obligations however large these are In 20082009 many managements learned how perilous that mindset can be22 Businesses with staying power have stable product characteristics a strong competitive advantage a fragmented customer and supplier base prudent capital allocation a growth mindset with a razorsharp focus on longterm profitability and sustainability a corporate culture of intelligent and measured risk taking a cashrich promoter family or parent company that can infuse capital during periods of high stress a highly liquid balance sheet and both the willingness and the capacity to suffer by investing for the long term at the expense of shortterm earnings These companies thus have higher longevity higher duration of cash flows and thus higher intrinsic value From an investors point of view staying power comes from a strong passion for the investing discipline a constant learning mind set along remaining investing life span low or no personal debt frugality discipline a sound understanding of human behavior market history and cognitive biases a patient longterm mindset and a supportive family whose importance is appreciated in a big way during the periodic rough times in the market It seems fitting to end this chapter with Buffetts profound words on avoiding the risk of ruin It takes twenty years to build a repu tation and five minutes to ruin it If you think about that youll do things differently2 SECTION V DECISIONMAKING CHAPTER 26 READ MORE HISTORY AND FEWER FORECASTS If have noticed anything over these 60 years on Wall Street it is that people do not succeed in forecasting whats going to happen to the stock market Benjamin Graham We believe that shortterm forecasts of stock or bond prices are useless The forecasts may tell you a great deal about the forecaster they tell you nothing about the future Warren Buffett Nobody can predict interest rates the future direction of the economy or the stock market Dismiss all such forecasts and concentrate on whats actually happening to the companies in which you have invested Peter Lynch Be a business analyst not a market macroeconomics or security analyst Charlie Munger We have two classes of forecasters Those who dont know and those who dont know they dont know John Kenneth Galbraith

afflicted by the faintest of doubts despite being wrong most of the time Have you ever wondered why the anchors and market experts on television make so many predictions day in and day out And why they are so happy to make these predictions Jason Zweig explains the constant human urge to predict in his book Your Money and Your Brain Just as nature abhors a vacuum people hate randomness The human compulsion to make predictions about the unpredictable originates in the dopamine centers of the reflexive brain I call this human tendency the prediction addiction emphasis added2 This tendency is driven by a pleasurable chemical in our brain called dopamine the release of which gives us a natural high to make the next prediction and the next one and the next one and so on The prediction addiction as Zweig explains is the compulsive desire to try to make sense out of just about everything in the world including things that are impossible to predict like future stock prices When the legendary J P Morgan was asked what the market would do he said It will fluctuate None of us can predict even our future Still we fall prey to the illusion of control and try to predict macros markets currencies and commodity prices Investment writer Dan Solin wrote about the prediction addiction in an article for the Huffington Post This addiction is a particu larly bad one Not only are our brains hardwired to believe we can predict the future and make sense out of random acts it rewards us for doing so The brain of someone engaged in this activity experiences the same kind of pleasure that drug addicts get from cocaine or gam blers experience when they enter a casino Prediction addicts are to the investor what the drug dealer is to the addict or the casino is to the gambler Try this fun exercise check the Google results for past predictions by any market expert on any macro topic over any randomly cho sen period of a few years Youll not take any of those people seriously ever again Predictions just grab eyeballs and achieve nothing else It is often said that bull markets climb a wall of worry Since March 2009 numerous worrisome headlines have driven many in vestors to sell out of fear and exit the market completely The fact that bad news is disseminated ten times as fast as positive news is one of the biggest reasons why its so difficult to just capture market returns You would think its as simple as buying the total market index fund and leaving it alone And it is that simple but it certainly isnt that easy because bad news smashes your face against an amplifier while good news just plays quietly in the background emphasis added Michael Batnick Progress happens too slowly to notice setbacks happen too quickly to ignore Morgan Housel Whatever methods you use to pick stocks your success will depend on your ability to ignore the worries of the world long enough to allow your stocks to succeed No matter how intelligent you are it isnt the head but the stomach that will determine your fate Peter Lynch With rare exceptions most of the miracles of humankind are longterm constructed events Progress comes bit by bit The silent miracle of humanitys march is this step by step year by year the world is improving Not on every single measure every single year but as arule Although the world faces huge challenges we have made tremendous progress This is a factbased worldview Weve cut the number of people living in extreme poverty worldwide by half over the past twenty years but Poverty Rates Drop Incrementally has never dominated news headlines When a trend is gradually improving over time with periodic sharp dips people are more likely to pay attention to the dips than to the overall improvement The news media tends to focus on vivid eventsthe dramatic the tragicrather than on the daily improvements and routine goodness in the world News channels compete to capture our attention with vivid stories and dramatic narratives They tend to focus on the unusual rather than the common and on the new or temporary rather than slowly changing patterns Fundamental improvements that are worldchanging events but too slow too fragmented or too small rarely qualify as news The stories that circulate fastest have an element of fear or anger and instill a sense of helplessness Open any news channel or go on social media You likely will hear or read about political instability market turbulence natural disasters murders suicides disease outbreaks geopolitical tensions and an endless list of bad news People frequently label the current times the worst ever but these individuals have obviously never read a history book The combination of negative dispositions and availability bias results in pervasive pessimism about the world In reality however we are living in one of the most promising times in the history of humankind The world has experienced an incredible amount of progress on many important parameters over almost any longterm time horizon you look at Its just that bad news is an event or headline whereas good news isa process or statistic And bad news as opposed to statistics makes for a more vivid and attentiongrabbing story Ihave observed that not the man who hopes when others despair but the man who despairs when others hope is admired by a large class of persons as a sage John Stuart Mill Remember the pessimist sounds smart but it is the optimist who makes money Commerce is the fundamental backbone of civilization When we invest in stocks we participate in commerce and support its constant progress Those who focus on this big picture prosper in the long run Others who focus only on crisis get jittery at the worst possible time and lose out on promising wealthcreation opportunities Investors should learn from Buffetts thoughts on the critical importance of focusing on individual businesses and ignoring all of the noise around interest rate hikes sharp spikes in inflation stock market crashes oil shocks toppling of government regimes reces sions depressions and even fullblown wars In his 1994 annual letter to shareholders he wrote We will continue to ignore political and economic forecasts which are an expensive distraction for many investors and businessmen Thirty years ago no one could have foreseen the huge expansion of the Vietnam War wage and price controls two oil shocks the resignation of a president the dissolution of the Soviet Union a oneday drop in the Dow of 508 points or Treasury bill yields fluc tuating between 28 percent and 174 percent But surprisenone of these blockbuster events made the slightest dent in Ben Grahams investment principles Nor did they render unsound the negotiated purchases of fine businesses at sensible prices Imagine the cost to us then if we had let a fear of unknowns cause us to defer or alter the deployment of capital Indeed we have usually made our best purchases when apprehensions about some macro event were at a peak emphasis added Fear is the foe of the faddist but the friend of the fundamentalist A different set of major shocks is sure to occur in the next 30 years We will neither try to predict these nor try to profit from them If we can identify businesses similar to those we have purchased in the past external surprises will have little effect on our longterm results And in his 2012 letter he stated A thought for my fellow CEOs Of course the immediate future is uncertain America has faced the unknown since 1776 Its just that sometimes people focus on the myriad of uncertainties that always exist while at other times they ignore them usually be cause the recent past has been uneventful American business will do fine over time And stocks will do well just as certainly since their fate is tied to business perfor mance Periodic setbacks will occur yes but investors and managers are in a game that is heavily stacked in their favor The Dow Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11497 in the 20th Century a staggering 17320 percent increase that materialized despite four costly wars a Great Depression and many recessions And dont forget that shareholders received substantial dividends throughout the century as well Since the basic game is so favorable Charlie and I believe its a terrible mistake to try to dance in and out of it based upon the turn of tarot cards the predictions of experts or the ebb and flow of business activity The risks of being out of the game are huge compared to the risks of being in it emphasis added2 Why does Buffett constantly emphasize that investors are in a game that is heavily stacked in their favor Look at figure 262 If more than two centuries of data cannot convince you that what Buffett says is true then probably nothing will Total Real Returns on US Stocks Bonds Bills Gold and the Dollar 18022012 1000000 oom 100000 10000 1000 61778 2180 irr ptt nero Bae 228 J 4 10 452 1 010 US Dollar 095 001 1802 1822 1842 1862 1882 1902 1922 1942 1962 1982 2002 Source Jeremy Siegel Stocks for the Long Run New York McGrawHill 2014 Looking at figure 262 we can clearly understand why Buffett has warned against treating cashequivalent holdings and currency denominated instruments as riskfree assets because holding them over long periods is actually quite risky Buffett views risk as loss of purchasing power And bonds widely touted as offering riskfree returns are today priced to deliver returnfree risk Fear has a greater grasp on human action than does the impressive weight of historical evidence Jeremy Siegel Whenever I am confronted with doubt despair or fear in the media about the current big picture I try to concentrate on the even bigger picture which is the one thats worth knowing about if you expect to be able to maintain a firm conviction in equities for the long term The even bigger picture tells us that for more than two centuries in spite of all of the major and minor calamities and all of the hundreds and thousands of reasons continuously given for why the world might be coming to an end equities have rewarded their own ers with real gains of more than 65 percent a year on averagefar higher than Treasury bills bonds gold and the worlds reserve cur rency History clearly shows that equities deliver the highest longterm real returns Their predominance over the other classes of assets is completely overwhelming Acting on this bit of information will be far more lucrative in the long run than reacting to the opinions and suggestions of commentators and advisory services that keep predicting the coming depression More money has been lost trying to anticipate and protect from corrections than actually in them Peter Lynch Howard Marks wrote in his memo to Oaktree clients in February 1993 The average annual return on equities from 1926 to 1987 was 944 percent But if you had gone to cash and missed the best 50 of those 744 months you would have missed all of the return This tells me that attempts at market timing are a source of risk not protection emphasis added In response to a sharp correction market experts usually say something like this The nearterm outlook is not clear There is a lot of global uncertainty Stock prices may fall even further so wait for some time until more clarity emerges Wait until the liquidity situation improves Wait until the elections are over There is currently a lot of political uncertainty In other words wait and watch This particular advice almost always turns out to be expensive for those investors who want to enjoy the ecstasy of rising stock prices in a bull market while avoiding the pain of falling prices in a bear market Superior stock market returns do not accrue in a uniform manner Rather they can be traced to a few periods of sudden bursts of strength Moreover the timing and the duration of these periods cannot be predicted accurately by anyone A significant percentage of the total gain from a bull market tends to occur during the initial market recovery phase If an investor is out of the market at that point in time he or she is likely to miss a substantial portion of the gains According to a study done by SageOne Investment Advisors even though the market index in India Sensex went up 251 times between 1979 and 2017 155 percent annualized returns if you missed 7 percent of the best months or 1 percent of the best days your returns would have been zero Investors need to bear the periodic bouts of downside volatility as the price to be paid for earning superior returns from equities Time in the market matters not timing the market The ability to keep investing at regular intervals to stay the course through thick and thin ups and downs and bull markets and bear markets and to not worry where the markets are going tomor row or next week or next month is what matters Simple Its simple but not easy Emotions cannot be backtested thats why all previous bear markets and the accompanying cheap stock valuations prevailing at those times look like cinch opportunities only in hindsight From the time of its IPO in 1980 through 2012 Apple was a 225bagger A 10000 investment in it turned into 225 million But an investor would have had to suffer through two declines of more than 80 percent and several drops of more than 40 percent along the way Even a quality business like Fairfax Financial which as of September 2019 has delivered returns of 18 percent compounded annual growth rate for thirtythree years saw its stock price fall almost 80 percent between 1999 and 2002 delivering negative returns in each of those four years How many investors do you think would have managed to hold on through a fouryear 80 percent drop People have different tolerance levels for downside volatilitywhen they think about big market falls and when the market falls actually happen All investors should study Morgan Housels Motley Fool article titled The Agony of High Returns The stock market is the only market in which things go ona fire sale and people run out of the store Ignore the scary predictions and constant urging from the gurus and experts for you to cash out during times of fear and panic in the market especially when you are sitting on sizeable unrealized gains that is when your temptation to book your profits and cash out will be at its peak Jargon is the financial communitys preferred method to sound more intelligent For instance theres an adage on Wall Street dont fight the Fed ie if the Fed is on a tightening course dont be longand if the Fed is lowering rates dont be short Sounds intuitive and logical right Now see the following 1 January 3 2001 The Fed cut rates 50 bps and the SP 500 closed at 1347 It declined 43 percent from that point to its October 2002 low while the Fed cut the whole way down 2 September 18 2007 The Fed cut rates 50 bps and the SP 500 closed at 1519 It declined 56 percent from that point to its March 2009 low while the Fed cut the whole way down 3 June 30 2004 The Fed hiked rates 25 bps and the SP 500 closed at 1140 It advanced 33 percent from that point to September 2007 rate cut while the Fed hiked 16 more times 4 December 16 2015 The Fed hiked rates 25 bps and the SP 500 closed at 2073 It advanced 45 percent from that point to July 2019 rate cut while the Fed hiked 8 more times Now consider these commonly heard comments in the business media 1 The market is turning weak because of rising interest rates 2 Historically stocks do well during periods of rising rates You can choose your preferred narrative which probably will be biased by your personal experiences The majority of the intelli gentsounding voices in the media will most likely choose the first option during periods of sharp market declines when preceded by a rise in interest rates Until the market does not react at all and remains sideways the rising interest rates wont appear in screaming headlines In fact during those times some experts may show historical charts or tables that illustrate periods of past bull markets during rising interest rate environments to justify the second option The market moves first The accompanying sensemaking narrative follows later Always The hard reality is that the stock market will do what it wants when it wants Investors should not obsess over highfrequency macro indicators Simply focus on individual businesses and their industry developments Thats the best one can do Nothing more Al ways remain humble and be intellectually honest Investors tend to replay their most recent traumatic market moments in their minds over and over again and those memories end up defining how those investors behave in the future The examples shared in this chapter clearly illustrate why having a solid grounding in history is vital to develop the nerves of steel required during the periodic dislocations that occur in financial markets Imet Charlie Munger in my USC graduate school investment class and had the opportunity to ask him this important question If Icould do one thing to make myself a better investment professional what would it be He answered Read history Read history Read history This was among the best pieces of advice I ever received Bob Rodriguez The study of history aims above all to make us aware of certain possibilities that we otherwise would not have considered Quite often we are surprised by something that hasnt happened yet in our lifetime even though the socalled unprecedented event may have taken place many times before in history Instead of engaging in futile attempts to predict the future we should try to diligently learn as much as possible from the past Study history and obtain relevant base rates that is historical data on relevant statistical groups over longer time horizons This practice helps avoid recency and vividness bias in a world characterized by extreme brevity of financial mem ory despite the ubiquity of cycles The Irrelevance of Politics for LongTerm Investors If you do not know history you think short term If you know history you think medium and long term Lee Kuan Yew In 1901 Theodore Roosevelt a Republican was sworn into office after the assassination of President William McKinley Fastforward a few decades to Franklin D Roosevelt a Democrat The period from the beginning of the Republican Roosevelts term to the end of the Democrat Roosevelts time in office included a variety of economic adversities including eight economic recessions the Great Depression the financial panic of 1907 and two long brutal world wars Despite these massive headwinds however Americas gross domestic prod uct GDP grew from 21 billion in 1901 when the first Roosevelt took office to around 228 billion by the time the second Roosevelt died in office in 1945a stunning elevenfold increase in fortyfour years During this time from the tum of the twentieth century through the end of World War II Republicans held the White House for twentyfour years Democrats for the other twenty America continued to forge ahead whether it was being led by the red or by the blue The postwar era has seen a similar balance as the political pendulum continues to swing back and forth But all the while America marches on From 1945 through the end of 2016a seventytwoyear periodRepublicans and Democrats have held the presidency for thirtysix years each Through seventytwo years of Republicans and Democrats Americas nominal GDP has grown from 02 trillion to 186 trillion a ninetythreefold increase and a 64 percent compound annual growth rate A better measure would involve adjusting these numbers for inflation which produces numbers that are even more remarkable Real GDP per capita was around 13000 in todays dollars in the mid1940s The real GDP per capita today is around 56000more than a fourfold increase in purchasing power and stan dard of living in just two and a half generations Note that the average middleclass American today has access to daily life amenities and conveniences far superior to those enjoyed by Americas richest man John D Rockefeller a mere one hundred years ago Abig part of Americas success has come by combining the benefits of its abundant natural resources with a system of government that has allowed its citizens the freedom to work hard pursue innovative ideas and risk capital in pursuit of financial gain Adam Smiths invisible hand has played a significant role in unleashing the market forces of capitalism Immigrants and capital are always attracted to countries with rule of law Where there is rule of law there is also more trust in business relations America will continue to attract the best talent from around the world and to create some of the worlds best companies that pro vide innovative products and services to customers This in turn will lead to greater profits and earning power for such companies and as part owners investors will concurrently benefit from the growing prosperity of those firms The inherent checks and balances in Americas system of government transcend the power of whoever sits in the White House The fabric of this nation and the foundation of its system are much stronger than any one man or woman or any particular body of lawmakers Americas economic progress will continue while Republicans hold control in Washington just as it will while Democrats do Owning a piece of this great system through a collection of quality businesses for the long term is a winners game In India a lot of noise and apprehension often surround government formation during election years and constant fear among investors of the market falling apart if a coalition government comes to power But conventional beliefs are frequently shattered by hard data and statistics table 261 TABLE 261

trillion dollars in GDP but only seven years to reach its second trillion The next consecutive trillions are expected to be reached in faster succession Even if market cap to GDP remains around parity in the long run one can envision the kind of wealth creation that lies in store for investors in great Indian businesses Trillions of dollars This in turn will have a positive multiplier effect on the

In times like these it helps to recall that there have always been times like these Bea Keen Student of Financial History There is nothing new in the world except the history you do not know Harry Truman Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it George Santayana A study of past manias and crashes should be part of every investors body of historical knowledge It informs and educates us as almost no other subject can about the psychology of people governments and nations More important it is yet another demonstration that hardly any events in the markets are unprecedented The only thing thats new in finance is the history we havent read Our imagination is limited only by our knowledge of history So knowing the fullest possible range of what has gone wrong before makes us better pre pared for what might go wrong again in the future French polymath Gustave Le Bon wrote one of the most influential works on social psychology The Crowd as a rant on French politics but his observations also describe how stock market manias take place The book widely considered to be the definitive work on mass psychology despite its 1895 publishing date explains how a crowd goes from controlled logic to uncontrolled emotion resulting in conscious personalities vanishing into a collective mind Under the influence of crowds individuals act bizarrely in ways they never would alone The key finding in Le Bons work is that crowds are mentally unified at the lowest most barbaric common denominator of their collective unconsciousnessinstincts passions and feelingsnot at the level of facts or reason Crowds are impressed by spectacle images and myths Misinformation and exaggeration become contagious Prestige attaches to true believers who reaffirm shared beliefs Under these conditions crowds chase a delusion until it is finally destroyed by experience Jesse Livermore is quoted as saying There is profit in studying the human factorsthe ease with which human beings believe what it pleases them to believe and how they allow themselvesindeed urge themselvesto be influenced by their cupidity or by the dollarcost of the average mans care lessness Fear and hope remain the same therefore the study of the psychology of speculators is as valuable as it ever was Nowhere does history indulge in repetitions so often or so uniformly as in Wall Street emphasis added When you read con temporary accounts of booms or panics the one thing that strikes you most forcibly is how little either stock speculation or stock speculators today differ from yesterday The game does not change and neither does human nature Human nature has not changed in centuries and the perennial emotions of greed and fear ensure that speculative follies keep playing out leading to endless cycles of booms and busts Prominent historical events include the Dutch tulip mania the South Sea Bubble during which a mythical company was chartered for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage but no one to know what it is the Roaring Twenties including the Florida land bubble followed by the Great Crash of 1929 the tronics boom in the 1960s and the Nifty Fifty in the 1970s More recent events include the US biotech bubble and Japans asset bubble in the 1980s the tech bubble in the 1990s the housing bubble in the 2000s and the cryptocurrency bubble of 2017 In many of these cases investors believed they were taking part in an adventure that would reinvent the world When it comes to investments the romantic appeal of being a party to a technological rev olution or an entirely new industry or invention often dominates profit considerations in investors minds A bubble typically is characterized by some major technological revolution cheap liquidity financial innovation that disguises higher leverage in John Kenneth Galbraiths words The world of finance hails the invention of the wheel over and over again often ina slightly more unstable version amnesia about the last bubble and abandonment of timehonored methods of security valuation The fuel is borrowed cash and margin purchases When these conditions are present always remember John Templetons warning The four most dangerous words in investing are This time its different Every bubble in financial history has eventually popped but the timing has always been a surprise for everyone You may get zero ideas in a year during periods of market frenzy but it is better to be patient than poor There are times to make money and times to avoid losing money The market is a great leveler A sudden crash puts everything in perspective cuts your ego in half and makes you realize your shortcomings and blind spots Most important the fundamental lessons on durability of individual business mod els quality of earnings prudent diversification and management integrity are reinstated Bear markets bring the fundamental truths of investing to the fore To be able to view them and imbibe them for our remaining investing life we need to embrace humility and be will ing to accept our mistakes Always be humble and remember that the ten years following the global financial crisis have been kind to investing track records and professional careers If you got your start at any point during this period be thankfuland do not skimp on reading history It seems fitting to end this chapter on the futility of forecasting with the following deepmeaning words from Peter Lynch There are 60000 economists in the US many of them employed fulltime trying to forecast recessions and interest rates and if they could do it successfully twice in a row theyd all be millionaires by now But as far as know most of them are still gainfully employed which ought to tell us something2 Thave nothing to add CHAPTER 27 UPDATING OUR

and change is new to ust Uber the worlds largest taxi company owns no vehicles Facebook the worlds most popular media owner creates no content Alibaba the most valuable retailer has no inventory And Airbnb the worlds largest accommodation provider owns no real estate Something interesting is happening Tom Goodwin We are living in an everchanging world is both a cliché and an understatement Regulations change all the time new tech nologies emerge unique business models evolve and disruptive innovations take shape across all walks of life It is an exciting time to be alive Rockets are landing themselves cars are driving themselves and money is governing itself In addition the ongoing switch from ownership that you purchase to access that you subscribe to overruns many conventions The five largest companies in the US market Apple Google Microsoft Amazon and Facebook require virtually no capital to grow All of these businesses scaled up much more quickly than Carnegies steel plants or Rockefellers oil refineries It took decades of toil and sweat and significant sums of capital to go around the country and cobble together a network of refineries in the latenineteenth and early twentieth centuries It took Mark Zucker berg just eight years to build Facebook from nothing to a business with 100 billion in valuationand just four more years to reach 300 billion The big picture is that software is eating the worldthat is many of the products and services developed over the past 150 years are transforming into or being disrupted by software The implications are enormous software is infinitely replicable and through the internet can be delivered at zero marginal cost When a major input to businessdistribution costgoes to zero entire industries get disrupted emphasis added When one can build a business model from the ground up with entirely new assumptions one can at tack incumbents in a way that is very difficult to defend Marcelo Lima Outdated and rigid models and methodologies to assess investments are being disrupted and continued reliance on these old techniques may identify value traps as value investments Value investing is not dead as is often stated in the media but rather how we measure value For most of the past century book value was the most relevant tool of valuation for most companies Book value means little at companies like Google Amazon or Facebook As innovation Scurves get steeper adoption cycles also have gotten much faster Today new business models make money and they are here to stay Although the adoption cycle for social media is different than it was for the radio or electricity many investors project the past onto the future and end up missing great opportunities The journey from tan gibles to intangibles is the true essence of the journey of investing The great companies of a century ago were confined primarily to their industries Rockefeller was an oilman He wouldnt have even thought about getting into retail banking or any other industry But companies like Amazon start in retail and then use their foundations and user bases to expand into multiple new lines of businesses In such a scenario one of the key skills required to be successful in todays day and age is flexible thinking In psychology this is referred to as cognitive flexibility Psychologists consider this flexibility to be one of the key mental skills required to succeed along with other skills such as creativity critical thinking and problem solving Henry Singleton who according to Warren Buffett had the best operating and capital deployment record in American business in his time said in an interview with BusinessWeek My only plan is to keep coming to work I like to steer the boat each day rather than plan ahead way into the future Singleton eschewed detailed strategic plans preferring to remain flexible I know a lot of people have very strong and definite plans that theyve worked out on all kinds of things but were subject to a tremendous number of outside influences and the vast majority of them cannot be predicted So my idea is to stay flexible2 In a similar vein Charlie Munger has said that at Berkshire there has never been a master plan Anyone who wanted to do it we fired because it takes on a life of its own and doesnt cover new reality We want people taking into account new information emphasis added2 Flexible thinking is the ability to keep an open mind upon encountering new facts or situations and to be adaptive to changing a viewpoint from previously held thoughts or beliefs however strongly held Most of what has been written about the market tells you the way it ought to be but successful investors do not rigidly hold on to the way it ought to be they simply go with what is Good investors read lot and practice the learnings obtained from books but the best investors make a calculated reasoned and conscious effort to adapt themselves to the actual ground realities of the individual local markets in which they operate In his book Dead Companies Walking Scott Fearon writes Failure terrifies people Theyll do whatever they have to do to downplay it wish it away and just plain pretend it doesnt exist Most of the time theyll go on living in denial long after the truth of their predica ment becomes obvious Fearon is referring to what is known as headinthesand syndrome Ostriches bury their heads in the sand when they are scared or threatened They think they are safe if they cant see the danger According to psychologists this syndromeignoring information that can help usarises from the need to avoid the negative feelings associated with accepting uncomfortable facts This syndrome describes a common human fallibility to engage in psychological denial and refuse to acknowledge reality Munger has talked about this human ten dency I think that one should recognize reality even when one doesnt like it indeed especially when one doesnt like it emphasis added He has also said Life in part is like a poker game wherein you have to learn to quit sometimes when holding a muchloved handyou must learn to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds We all are learning modifying or destroying ideas all the time Rapid destruction of your ideas when the time is right is one of the most valuable qualities you can acquire You must force yourself to consider arguments on the other side Theres no way that you can live an adequate life without many mistakes In fact one trick in life is to get so you can handle mistakes Failure to handle psychological denial is a common way for people to go broke Businesspeople and investors tend to ignore these words and never give up on their pet projects and favorite stocks even when it makes no sense to continue They keep throwing good money after bad or they keep averaging on the way down in bad businesses They follow the same approach until they go broke One of the surest ways to go broke is to keep getting an increasing share of a shrinking mar ket This is a slow but sure death It is gradual then sudden Unpleasant facts do not cease to exist just because they are ignored We should learn from Mungers comments during the 2000 Berkshire annual meeting about gracefully accepting changing realities in the right spirit I think its in the nature of things for some businesses to die Its also in the nature of things that in some cases you shouldnt fight it Theres no logical answer in some cases except to wring the money out and go elsewhere These words remind me of a quote from Daniel Kahneman that is worth thinking about frequently When I work I have no sunk costs I like changing my mind Some people really dont like it but for me changing my mindisa thrill Its an indication that Im learning something So I have no sunk costs in the sense that I can walk away from an idea that Ive worked on for a year if Ican see a better idea Its a good attitude for a researcher The main track that young researchers fall into is sunk costs They get to work on a project that doesnt work and that is not promising but they keep at it Ithink too much persis tence can be bad for you in the intellectual world Good investing is a peculiar balance between the conviction to follow your ideas and the flexibility to recognize when you have made a mistake You need to believe in something but at the same time you need to recognize that you will be wrong a considerable num ber of times over the course of your investing career This fact holds true for all investors regardless of their stature The balance between confidence and humility is best learned through extensive experience and mistakes Always respect the person on the other side of the trade and ask yourself Why does he or she want to buy or sell What does he or she know that I dont You must be intellectually honest with yourself at all times The great investors are active seekers of truth All businesspeople and investors should study Buffetts 1985 letter in which he explains his decision to shut down the textile operations of Berkshire It is a remarkable case study in rationality and objectivity In his 1994 lecture at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business Munger shared his thoughts on Buffetts decision The great lesson in microeconomics is to discriminate between when technology is going to help you and when its going to kill you And most people do not get this straight in their heads But a fellow like Buffett does He knew that the huge productivity increases that would come from a better machine introduced into the production of a commodity product would all go to the benefit of the buyers of the textiles Nothing was going to stick to our ribs as owners Thats such an obvious conceptthat there are all kinds of wonderful new inventions that give you nothing as owners except the opportunity to spend a lot more money in a business thats still going to be lousy The money still wont come to you All of the advan tages from great improvements are going to flow through to the customers Conversely if you own the only newspaper in Oshkosh and they were to invent more efficient ways of composing the whole newspaper then when you got rid of the old technology and got new fancy computers and so forth all of the savings would come right through to the bottom line Inall cases the people who sell the machineryand by and large even the internal bureaucrats urging you to buy the equipmentshow you projections with the amount youll save at current prices with the new technology However they dont do the second step of the analysis which is to determine how much is going to stay home and how much is just going to flow through to the cus tomer Ive never seen a single projection incorporating that second step in my life emphasis added Conducting a discounted cash flow or net present value exercise without carrying out the necessary second step of the analysis leads to overlooking expected competitor actions game theory and results in a distorted view of reality that eventually leads to losses for investors and companies When we experience a favorable policy change or an industry tailwind competitive pressures may mean that all or most of the benefits are captured by customers A sustainably high return on invested capital which indicates the presence of some form of competitive advantage is the best sign that a company can beat this challenge For many years Buffett called himself an aeroholic and expressed serious reservations about investing in airline stocks Then in 2016 Berkshire Hathaway revealed holdings in not one but four airline stocks Observe the remarkable flexibility in Buffetts thinking When the industry dynamics of the airline sector changed Buffett promptly changed his mind after an objective and dispassionate con sideration of the new facts If you are dispassionate youll winthats my greatest learning from the Bhagavad Gita Ajay Piramal New evidence should modify our prior beliefs and convert them into our posterior beliefs The stronger the prior belief the more difficult it will be to change it Buddhism has a concept called beginners mind which is an active openness to try new things and study new ideas unburdened by past preconceptions If however we have no prior knowledge about a given situation at hand then we will depend completely on the available evidence specific to the case For this reason a basic minimum understanding of the big ideas from the key disciplines is essential to form an initial hypothesis In one of his blog posts on 25iqcom Tren Griffin describes the essence of Ray Dalios decisionmaking process Dalio starts with a rational analysis of the information he has and from that he forms a hypothesis He then exposes that hypothesis to thoughtful people with alternative points of view and methods of analysis who may disagree with him and then he wants a rad ically transparent back and forth discussion As part of that process he wants to deeply understand the reasoning of any thought ful opposing views Only after he has understood these alternative points of view does Dalio believe he is in a position to reject or accept the alternative ideas and make a decision We always need a devils advocate to challenge our assumptions Professor Mihir Desai highlighted the importance of consciously seeking out diversity in viewpoints in his book The Wisdom of Finance The relationships that are most enriching are ones that broaden our perspective beyond our usual experiencethose relationships are in finance terms imperfectly correlated assets precisely the types of assets that most enhance the portfolios of our lives Homophily or the desire to surround ourselves with likeminded people is a common social instinctand one that finance warns against Yes its easier to be around likeminded types but finance recommends the hard work of exposing yourself to differences not shielding yourself from them emphasis added You cant really learn anything new if youre always surrounded by people who agree with you As investors we often have our per sonal group of intellectual peers with whom we discuss our ideas But we should be careful that our sounding board does not turn into an echo chamber for that would be harmful for our decisionmaking process Amay Hattangadi and Swanand Kelkar wrote about this issue in a December 2016 report for Morgan Stanley titled Connecting the Dots We tend to be surrounded by people who are like us and share our world view Social media accentuates this by tailoring our news and opinion feeds to match our preset views To avoid falling into this homogeneity trap one needs to seek out and dispassionately engage with people whose views differ from your own and thats true not just for current affairs but your favorite stocks as well The Internet which provides the promise of access to a great diversity of viewpoints in fact speeds our retreat into a confirmatory bubble In an early article for Livemint newspaper Hattangadi and Kelkar write Social media will systematically find ways to ensure that we are fed with more of what we find appealing Our Facebook feed is filtered based on previous history of likes Amazon suggests books to buy based on our pattern of previous purchases Twitter suggests whose tweets we should follow based on those we are already following The online world has magnified the decibel level of the reverberations in an echo chamber manifold2 During our investing journey we may come across certain special businesses that make us feel excited and at the same time challenge our prior beliefs and preconceived notions because these businesses may belong to difficult industries or less favored geographic locations How can we overcome our personal prejudices against these businesses in such situations How can we better calibrate our prior views in light of new evidence The answer lies in an elementary mathematical concept all of us learned in school Conditional Probability Conditional probability also known as Bayess rule measures the probability of an event given that another event has occurred In his book Thinking Fast and Slow Daniel Kahneman has simplified the formula for us The simplest form of Bayess rule is in odds form poste rior odds prior odds likelihood ratio where the posterior odds are the odds the ratio of probabilities for two competing hypotheses2 According to this equation ones prior beliefs prior odds are subject to revision with the help of the likelihood ratio The higher that ratio the higher should be the change in ones view of a given situation Although prior beliefs can come from many sources an excellent source is base rates which represent historical statistical informa tion The likelihood ratio represents new information about a specific case that changes the odds The higher the likelihood ratio the higher the posterior odds Sometimes the information and characteristics specific to the situation being examined are so vivid and persua sive that it leads us to overlook the base rates or the average historical experience In those cases Mungers warning usually comes true When you mix raisins with turds youve still got turds Bayess Rule as a Way of Thinking If you dont get this elementary but mildly unnatural mathematics of elementary probability into your repertoire then you go through a long life like a onelegged man in an asskicking contest Youre giving a huge advantage to everybody else Charlie Munger Philip Tetlock a prominent political science writer has produced extensive research over the years debunking experts who have little pre dictive abilities His extensive research also highlighted the characteristics of superforecasters who have built exceptional track records Interestingly although all of them practice Bayesian thinking as a way of life they do not always engage in rigorous number crunching or complex math In their book Superforecasting Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner write Do forecasters really have to understand memorize and use an algebraic formula I have good news No they dont The superfore casters are a numerate bunch many know about Bayes theorem and could deploy it if they felt it was worth the trouble But they rarely crunch the numbers so explicitly What matters far more to the superforecasters than Bayes theorem is Bayes core insight of gradually getting closer to the truth by constantly updating in proportion to the weight of the evidence emphasis added1 In his October 2015 white paper titled Worldly Wisdom in an Equation Professor Sanjay Bakshi shared six core insights from Bayesian thinking to keep in mind 1 Translate vague language into numeric probabilities Bayesians are careful about the language they use when they think in terms of probabilities Tetlock writes Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more Few things are either certain or impossible And maybe isnt all that informative So your uncertainty dial needs more than three settings Nuance matters The more degrees of uncertainty you can distinguish the better a forecaster you are likely to be As in poker you have an advantage if you are better than your competitors at separating 6040 bets from 4060or 5545 from 4555 Translating vagueverbiage hunches into numeric probabilities feels unnatural at first but it can be done It just requires patience and practice The Central Intelligence Agencys publication Words

any common stock the first step is to see how money has been most successfully made in the past Investors are prone to overlook base rates however when they come across a vivid or enticing description of a specific case Base rates are a boring piece of statistics Stories on the other hand are seductive In his book What Works on Wall Street James OShaughnessy writes Human nature makes it virtually impossible to forgo the specific information of an individual case likelihood ratio in favor of the results of a great number of cases prior odds or base rates Were interested in this stock and this company not with this class of stocks or this class of companies Large numbers mean nothing to us As Stalin chillingly said One death is a tragedy a million a statistic When making an investment we almost always do so on a stockbystock basis rarely thinking about an overall strategy If a story about one stock is compelling enough were willing to ignore what the base rate tells us about an entire class of stocks emphasis added8 Before paying an exorbitantly high pricetoearnings PE multiple for a business one should study the historical averagedout experience of paying such prices Similarly before committing money to highly expensive initial public offerings one should look at the historical averagedout experience Before investing in a highly leveraged business or a business in which the management has a track record of poor governance or capital allocation one should look at the historical longterm outcomes of making investments in such situations Taking base rates into account helps check ones initial overenthusiasm after hearing an exciting story about a stock When Buffett avoids investing in turnaround situations it is because he relies on base rates According to him Turnarounds seldom turn This is why the best time to buy a turnaround is when evidence of a turnaround is already in place You wont get in at the bottom but you will have eliminated a lot of risk and uncertainty When Buffett avoids investing in fastchanging hightechnology businesses and justifies that by stating that severe change and exceptional returns usually dont mix22 he is relying on base rates An effective way to think about base rates is to think in terms of the outside view and the inside view used by Daniel Kahneman Tetlock writes Daniel Kahneman has a much more evocative visual term for base rates He calls it the outside viewin contrast to the inside view which is the specifics of the particular case Its natural to be drawn to the inside view Its usually concrete and filled with engaging detail we can use to craft a story about whats going on The outside view is typically abstract bare and doesnt lend itself so readily to storytelling So even smart accomplished people routinely fail to consider the outside view emphasis added22 3 All toogoodtobetruesounding stories are not necessarily bad A genuinely good story improves the likelihood ratio which then translates into higher posterior odds This is an important point for fundamental investors because they are bottomup investors in individual businesses and are not investing in broad strategies For a Graham and Doddstyle investor who believes in mean reversion and wants to invest in statistical bargains base rates are extremely important and specific stock stories are less important For a qualitative investor who follows Fisher or Munger however learning as much as possible about the specific business is critically important Of course such an investor must never lose sight of the underlying base rate But he or she should also be able to identify diamonds in the rough In those cases a compelling story usually makes the business unique and it stands out from the rest of the industry Usually that story is about an extraordinary individual who has demonstrated capabilities of creating value even in businesses and industries in which it is difficult to do so Munger calls such individuals intelligent fanatics Harvey Firestone describes such individuals in his book Men and Rubber The test of a business man is not whether he can make money in one or two boom years or can make money through the luck of getting into the field first but whether in a highly competitive field without having any initial advantage over his competitors he can out distance them in a perfectly honorable way and keep the respect of himself and of his community22 Intelligent fanatics let their execution and not their charisma do the talking Judge them based on their execution track record and do not get influenced by the use of superlatives and adjectives by other people which is usually more of a persuasion technique than any thing else 4 Distinguish between the signal and the noise The signal is the truth The noise is what distracts us from seeing it In his book The Signal and the Noise Nate Silver writes There isnt any more truth in the world than there was before the Internet or the printing press Most of the data is just noise as most of the universe is filled with empty space22 If we want to increase the signaltonoise ratio we need to first cut out the cacophony of all the noise surrounding us As James Gleick says When information is cheap attention becomes expensive24 More data do not result in more insights Often they just lead to bad judgment The scarcest resource for successful investors is not money but attentionhow to manage the tradeoff between time and rationality to best effect Investment skill lies not in knowing every thing but in judicious neglect making wise choices about what to overlook To ferret out the valuable signal from the noisy news flow first quiet the mind and then look for the slow gradual changes that are taking place The way to do that is to focus on longterm changes and not quarterly monthly or daily changes These could be changes in the quality of the balance sheet the income statement or the cash flow statement Those changes should be related to a solid qualitative analysis of the reasons And it is this kind of calm measured and thoughtful qualitative analysis that eventually leads to what noted value investor Paul Lountzis calls differential insights2 The conven tions of analyst research mean that longterm value is often underappreciated For example most research focuses on a one or twoyear forecast horizon so companies with a large part of their value beyond this horizon may be undervalued 5 Follow Darwins golden rule of thinking Counterintuition was Darwins specialty He was so good at this way of thinking be cause he had a simple but highly unnatural habit of thought He paid special attention to collecting facts that did not agree with his prior conceptions Darwin called this the golden rule Thad also during many years followed a golden rule namely that whenever a published fact a new observation or thought came across me which was opposed to my general results to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once for had found by ex perience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from memory than favorable ones Owing to this habit very few objections were raised against my views which I had not at least noticed and attempted to answer2 Darwins great success was driven by his ability to see note and learn from objections to his cherished thoughts The Origin of Species has stood up in the face of 159 years of subsequent biological research because Darwin was so careful to make sure the theory was nearly impossible to refute Later scientists would find the book slightly incomplete but not incorrect Darwin probably influenced Mungers prescription on the work required to hold an opinion you must understand the opposite side of the argument better than the person holding that side does Your opinion is more credible when you also can clearly articulate the contrary view This way of thinking is quite unnatural in the face of our genetic makeup wherein the more typical response is to look for as much confirming evidence as possible When practiced in the right spirit however it is a powerful way to beat our shortcomings in be coming objective and unbiased Darwins habits of completeness diligence accuracy and habitual objectivity ultimately led him to make his greatest break throughs His process was extremely tedious No spark of divine insight gave him his edge He just started with the right basic ideas and then worked for a long time and with extreme focus and objectivity always keeping his eye on reality A useful supplement to Darwins golden rule of thinking is a basic pros and cons list which Benjamin Franklin in a 1772 letter to Joseph Priestley referred to as Moral or Prudential Algebra 6 View the stock market as a parimutuel betting system In a parimutuel system such as the stock market one is betting against other investors And in such a system the behavior of other investors changes the odds Bakshi writes When for example an exceptionally wellmanaged niche business hiding inside a commodity industry is valued by the market as a commodity business it represents an opportunity While the thoughtful Bayesian investor takes care not to lose sight of the fact that business belongs to a commodity industry low prior odds he also factors in the key evidence specific to the business which makes it exceptional resulting in a high likelihood ratio Therefore for this investor the posterior odds are far better than those implied by the stock markets assessment of the business And that is an exploitable prejudice Bayesian thinking helps us overcome our biases and personal prejudices Many investors in the Indian markets have a prejudice against Hyderabadbased companies microcap stocks turnaround situations conglomerates highly leveraged companies commodity stocks and holding companies That prejudice baseline information is reflected in the cheaper valuations At the same time however writes Bakshi you should recognize the possibility that this particular business which you are evaluating could be different from the statistical class to which it belongs For instance I usually begin studying select leveraged distress situations after the borrowers have entered into a formal debtrestructuring arrangement When the Facts Change Change Your Mind We are capable of changing our minds if the facts change Weve done this several times but I must say it is hard Charlie Munger In his book Winning on Wall Street Martin Zweig talks about how bearish he was during a selloff in February and March 1980 I was sitting there looking at conditions and being as bearish as I could bebut the market had reversed Things began to change as the Fed reduced interest rates and eased credit controls Even though I had preconceived ideas that we were heading toward some type of calamity I responded to changing conditions emphasis added He concludes The problem with most people who play the market is that they are not flexible To succeed in the market you must have discipline flexibility and patience28 Longterm investors buy stocks with the idea of holding them for many years Even then an investor needs to continually verify the validity of his or her original investment thesis Whenever a trend reversal occurs either up or down it takes a while for people to recognize it But when you have been invested in a stock for some time you gradually develop a good understanding of the evolving busi ness and industry dynamics and you just know when the sustainable growth rate has permanently slowed down for good or when cracks begin to appear in your original investment thesis This helps you exit in time ahead of the subsequent PE derating period which is par ticularly painful to experience and perplexing for many new investors when the companys earnings continue to grow but at a slower pace than originally discounted in the steep valuations The art of timely selling is gradually developed through reallife experience in the markets and increasing familiarity with the finer nuances of various industries and their evolving valuation dynamics over time One should not hurriedly sell a great business if it becomes temporarily overvalued and if the stock in question is a bull market sector leader then one should have the courage to hold on to it for the entire length of the bull run In great businesses one tends to get frequent positive surprises and they tend to end up delivering much better performance than we initially envisaged as was the case for instance with Bajaj Finance When you find the goose that lays golden eggs dont sell the goose One big lesson I have learned over the years is to be reluctant to sell a great business that is trading at expensive valuations especially when cash is the alternative A better approach is to wait to sell until a far superior opportunity comes along or until the stock has become absurdly overvalued When we per ceive great companies to be fairly valued on an immediate shortterm basis they often are significantly undervalued on a longterm basis As Fisher wrote in his book Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits How can anyone say with even moderate precision just what is overpriced for an outstanding company with an unusually rapid growth rate Suppose that instead of selling at twentyfive times earnings as usually happens the stock is now at thirtyfive times earnings Perhaps there are new products in the immediate future the real economic importance of which the financial community has not yet grasped Perhaps there are not any such products If the growth rate is so good that in another ten years the company might well have quadrupled is it really of such great concern whether at the moment the stock might or might not be 35 percent overpriced That which really matters is not to disturb a position that is going to be worth a great deal more later If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased the time to sell it isalmost never emphasis added22 Over the long term stocks should outperform most other asset classes and should almost certainly earn higher returns than cash Cash will always prove to be valuable on occasion but over a period of twenty to thirty years the drag on portfolio performance from hold ing cash will be much more significant than the few occasional benefits one would get from taking advantage of any periodic downturn with dry powder John Templetons quote on the subject of when to invest is one of my favorites The best time to invest is when you have money This is because history suggests it is not timing which matters but time2 The key to wealth creation is to buy highquality growing businesses at reasonable valuations and then just sit on them for a very long time If you take any random sample of a hundred successful investors who have compounded their capital at a good rate for a long time you will invariably observe that almost all of them would have bought some great businesses and then just sat tight on them As Munger says The big money is not in the buying and selling but in the waiting21 For most people doing nothing is just unbearable They want action and fear losing their marktomarket profits As a result they keep jumping from one stock to another and in the process drastically increase the potential for unforced errors Blaise Pascal rightly said all mens miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone As investors we are continuously processing myriad incoming information Assessing material facts with an open mind and changing ones mind when those facts change for better or worse is a valuable skill that increases the odds of investing success Some times it may happen that one of our longterm secular growth holdings not the shorterterm commoditycyclicalspecial situation hold ing for which the primary focus is on mispricing and mean reversion rather than quality of business and management begins to make our stomach churn We are no longer comfortable holding it for certain corporate governance reasons or management integrity issues that we may have discovered after our initial purchase Even though I may expect that company to report high earnings growth for the next few years and its stock may well go up a lot in the interim period in those cases I usually exit my position I do not want to trade a peaceful nights sleep for a few extra percentage points of return As Walter Schloss used to say Investing should be fun and challenging not stressful and worrying In an interview Schlosss son Edwin said that his fathers longevity and investing philosophy were probably related A lot of money managers today worry about quarterly comparisons in earnings Theyre up biting their fingernails until five in the morning My dad never worried about quarterly comparisons He slept well22 Quality of life is a better way to measure winning and losing It is a welldocumented fact that stress is a Killer Investors often talk about riskadjusted returns but rarely about stressadjusted returns In my view the latter matters more Sleeping well is more important than eating well Avoid shorting stocks Avoid taking on personal debt to buy stocks Avoid entering into longterm partnerships with management teams that make your stomach churn As Benjamin Graham says You cannot make a quantitative deduction toallow for an unscrupulous management the only way to deal with such situations is to avoid them38 An investor should be flexible in his or her thinking and make difficult decisions like selling a stock even if it means incurring a loss big or small on it Be emotionally detached from the outcomes and make decisions based on a dispassionate analysis of factual data Treat losses with equanimity and note the lessons learned Optimism is a good thing but selfdelusion is not As Peter Lynch says Theres no shame in losing money on a stock Everybody does it What is shameful is to hold on toa stock or worse to buy more of it when the fundamentals are deteriorating4 Do not hold on toa stock with worsening fundamentals in the mere hope that things will somehow get better Always acknowledge and embrace reality for what it is and dont engage in what Munger calls thumbsucking If you are unsure about a stock even after your best efforts to resolve your doubts just exit and get out Otherwise you will end up selling in panic ata much lower price during the next sharp market correction You need to materially adapt when losing and remain faithful when winning If you have the discipline to do just these two things you will succeed as an investor Use Bayesian reasoning and update probabilities as new evidence arises that affects your expected returns Some evidence points to look for excessive valuations corporate governance concerns a sharp slowdown in growth rates loss of competitiveness as reflected in declining market share and falling margins and loss of bargaining power with customers or suppliers as reflected in deterioration of the working capital situation It is perfectly okay to be wrong but it is not okay to remain wrong One of the great lessons I have learned over the course of my life and investing career is this if you want to win better than the rest you must learn how to lose better than the rest I am happy to have learned Confuciuss teaching well A man who has committed a mistake and doesnt correct it is committing another mistake CHAPTER 28 LIFE IS A SERIES OF OPPORTUNITY COSTS If you take the best text in economics by Mankiw he says intelligent people make decisions based on opportunity costsin other words its your alternatives that matter Thats how we make all of our decisions Charlie Munger s investors we are in the business of intelligently allocating capital With limited capital at our disposal and several alternatives the critical concept of opportunity cost arises An opportunity cost is defined as the value of the secondbest opportunity which we forgo when we make a choice In a world in which alternatives are mutually exclusive and we must choose A over B or Bover A our opportunity cost would be the potential gain of B if we choose A and vice versa Charlie Munger has said When someone presented a company in an emerging market to Warren Buffett Warren said I dont feel more comfortable buying this than I feel about adding to our position in Wells Fargo He thinks highly of the company and the managers and the position they were in He was using this as his opportunity cost He was saying Dont talk about anything unless its better than buying more Wells Fargo It doesnt matter to Warren where the opportunity is He has no preconceived ideas about whether Berkshires money ought to be in this or that Hes scanning the world trying to get his opportunity cost as high as he can so his individual deci sions would be better Mungers words have significant implications for investors If you expect to achieve a much higher level of returns from one stock that you do not expect to achieve in the others then why should you continue to allocate capital to the rest of them Wouldnt it make more sense to remain fully invested until a much better return opportunity appears All too often investors succumb to the do some thing syndrome and relax their standards for incoming investments instead of firmly maintaining a high hurdle rate at all times Be unreasonable Its a funny thing about life if you refuse to accept anything but the best you very often get it W Somerset Maugham Capital is finite and always carries an opportunity cost which is what you can do with the next best alternative If your next best alternative is 1 percent your opportunity cost is 1 percent and if it is 10 percent the cost is 10 percent no matter what some formula created in academia might say Always remember the highest and best use of capital should always be measured by the next best possible use If know I have something that yields 8 percent for sure and something else came along at 7 percent Id reject it instantly Every thing is a function of opportunity cost Warren Buffett Ifa business doesnt ear a return that investors could earn elsewhere then from an investors standpoint for all practical purposes that business destroys value Said another way if the return on capital isnt equal to or better than the cost of capital what investors could earn elsewhere then the business is in effect destroying value for shareholders Acknowledging and Accounting for Mistakes of Omission Mistakes of omission are situations in which we have identified a promising business to invest in but fail to pull the trigger Because we act penny wise and pound foolish our inaction results in a huge opportunity cost In the long run opportunity costs can really matter a lot and sometimes are far more significant than errors of commission Mistakes of commission are capped at 100 percent but mistakes of omission have no such ceiling When people think about costs they dont think in terms of opportunity costs For most people the explicit outofpocket costs carry more meaning than opportunity costs and because forgone opportunities are not outofpocket costs people underweigh them For longterm investors hesitancy in paying up for highquality businesses often carries a big opportunity cost These costs do not show up in profitandloss PL statements because a PL does not reflect what they could have done but did not do Investors need to regularly review their estimate of the expected longterm return from a stock based on the current market price If it falls below the return available on existing passive income instruments then it is time to replace that stock with a superior one Many investors fall in love with their existing holdings especially if they have identified it after a lot of hard work and subsequently engage in lazy thinking and do not conduct a rigorous opportunity cost analysis on a regular basis Every single dollar spends the same and in vestors should strive to achieve the biggest bang for their buck from every single dollar invested Use a high hurdle rate when assessing any potential investment opportunity Be unreasonable You often hear investors making irrational statements like I am happy to hold this stock because I bought it at a lower price even if the longterm appreciation potential from the current price is poor Anchoring bias is powerful and it occurs automatically at a sub conscious level An effective way to counter this bias is to mentally liquidate your portfolio before the start of every trading day and ask yourself a simple question Given all the current and updated information I now have about this business would I buy it at the current price If you conclude that you would not buy the shares today but find that you cannot push the sell button be aware that this is because of endowment bias and not because of a logical hold thesis Sell Clinging to stocks with unsatisfactory expected future returns from their current price is a costly mistake that negatively affects an investors longterm net worth The opportunity cost mental model should be used in conjunction with the circle of competence principle Things that you are inca pable of understanding should not form part of the opportunity set from which you determine your opportunity cost If come across a superlative investment opportunity within my circle of competence then I do not mind immediately selling the weak holdings if any in my portfolio even at a loss if required without any hesitation At any time we always hold one or two stocks in our portfolio that are our least favorites They are not always bad stocks per se We just are subconsciously aware that they are weaker than the other stocks in our portfolio but we still tend to hold on to them and that we would not mind selling them at a future date if required When you come across what you strongly believe is a great investment idea conduct a rigorous analysis to actively search for disconfirming evidence within all your existing holdings In most cases you will find that your smallestweight holdings will be the ones that get sold because you had less conviction in them to start with as indicated by their low weights It is always better to go with certainty when uncertainty is not expected to yield a whole lot greater expected return As an investor Thave a simple rule when looking at new ideas If 1 am going to add a new position to my portfolio it needs to be significantly better than what I already own When we are truly disciplined and highly demanding in the required hurdle rate for incoming ideas then the best stock to buy at any given time is usually among the ones we already own in our portfolio Dont diversify just for the sake of it Avoid adding anything to your life your investment portfolio or your business unless it makes them better Opportunity Costs Are Applicable in All Aspects of Our Lives Opportunity costs are all about the most basic of economic concepts tradeoffs If you make a choice you forgo all the other options at least for the time being Sometimes the option you didnt choose turns out to have been the wiser choice which is why opportunity cost is best measured in hindsight Opportunity costs can be best understood by looking at what would have been given up if certain pathbreak ing individuals had chosen to do something else What if Sam Walton had not decided to start Walmart stores at fortyfour years of age What if Thomas Edison had stopped working on the light bulb when he failed the first few thousand times Whatif Steve Jobs had never returned to Apple to lead its resurgence fundamentally reshaping the future of consumer technology We are no different from these renowned individuals We make decisions every day about how we spend our time money brain power and energy and for every decision we make there is an alternative that we didnt choose And it is the choice not taken that repre sents our opportunity cost All rejected alternatives are paths to possible futures in which things could be better or worse than the path we chose Every decision commits us to some course of action that by definition eliminates acting on other alternatives We always have an opportunity cost when we make choices What if you had learned a new skill that got you a promotion instead of bingewatching Game of Thrones What if you had worked during college instead of taking out a big student loan What if you had become a fitness enthusiast instead of a junk foodie In essence you make your choices and then your choices make you Every decision no matter how slight alters the trajectory of your life Every choices compound effect is in action all the time Your life today is a result of your past choices Hard choices easy life Easy choices hard life Most people fail to appreciate the deep meaning in Benjamin Franklins words Beware of little expenses a small leak will sink a great ship Lets say you pick up your daily morning cup of coffee at Starbucks for 4 Every single time in exchange for a beverage you could make at home for a few cents you spend 4 If you buy fifty coffees this year about one per week for 200 you are giving up 23500 in future wealth fifty years from now assuming you invested the money in a lowcost index fund at an expected annual return of 10 percent Investing is nothing but deferring gratification today to consume more at a future date and opportunity costs lie at the heart of investing The point is not to give up everything you love but rather to emphasize the opportunity cost of the daily decisions you make A more positive approach is to increase your earning power because it is easier to figure out how to make an extra thousand dollars than it is to skip a latte for 365 days straight Reducing your expenses shortens the time it takes to reach financial freedom Although there are limits on how low your expenses can go there are no limits on how much you can earn The best investment you can make is an investment in yourself FineTuning Our Thinking Process to Incorporate Opportunity Costs Our brain sees only what is right in front of us This is known as availability bias We are blind to other opportunities and in most cases we ignore them Daniel Kahneman defines this problem with the abbreviation WYSIATIwhat you see is all there is To overcome this challenge maintain a checklist and add opportunity cost as an item Before making any major decision in life refer to the checklist This will ensure that you always consider other alternatives Is there a way we can overcome availability bias when faced with a complex problem Turns out there is indeed a simple way to doit Its simple but not easy It requires us to train our minds to think in a certain manner According to Sanjay Bakshi Well Charlie already taught us how to do that we just follow what he says We try to look at a problem from multiple perspectives Thats I think the correct way of doing it When you are trying to evaluate something you are trying to ask the question Why Why did this happen And when you reflect upon it you find that the answer sometimes comes from multiple disciplines and you get down to that and try to figure it out It is very enjoyable to do it in that way The process for me has always been to ask the question Why and wait Because the mind will tend to jump to a certain answer and thats not the only answer So the way Ithink about it is wherever there is a complex question I am trying to answer I always start with the words Part of the reason is this which means there must be other parts too Id like to think about what those parts might be There dont have to be twenty of themeven if there are three or four of them thats better than one So it helps me to ask the question Why and then look for answers emphasis added When something is at the forefront of our thoughts we assume it to be correct Sometimes this works Sometimes it doesnt and usually that involves second or thirdlevel consequences Ray Dalio has written about this in his book Principles Similarly Howard Marks has often advocated the adoption of secondlevel thinking Secondlevel and beyond thinking is to ask And then what at each stage of the decisionmaking process while humbly acknowledging Part of the reason is this Looking at things through the And then what lens can help you avoid making hurried decisions in life based on emotions Whether you are looking to invest in a business or in a new re lationship or career never forget to ask And then what It may well turn out to be a lifesaver CHAPTER 29 PATTERN RECOGNITION Charlie and I have seenwere not remotely perfect at thisbut weve seen patterns Pattern recognition gets very important in evaluat ing humans and businesses And the pattern recognition isnt 100 percent and none of the patterns exactly repeat themselves but there are certain things in business and securities markets weve seen over and over Warren Buffett Untapped Pricing Power Within the growth stock model theres a subposition There are actually businesses that you will find a few times in a lifetime where any manager could raise the return enormously just by raising pricesand yet they havent done it So they have huge untapped pricing power that theyre not using That is the ultimate nobrainer Charlie Munger Ithough nominal pricing power is generally considered to be the best hedge against inflation it is only a necessary but not sufficient condition for identifying great businesses The dream scenario for a business owner is the ability to raise the price of his or her product or service in excess of inflation without affecting market share or unit volume This real pricing power can create significant value for investors as part owners of the business Look at how Sees Candies effortlessly raises prices every year on De cember 26 This is a rare and attractive business to own A business that can increase prices at a rate that only offsets inflation is good but it is not exceptional And although it is good to identify a business that has consistently raised its prices it actually might be better to find a business that has not raised its prices in a long time for one reason or another thus causing its product or service to become underpriced and undervalued to customers This situation creates a sort of pentup pricing power that can be released in the form of future real price increases for a certain period of time Real pricing power indicates an inefficiently priced product or service This undervaluation is a source of great potential value as the business begins to price its product or service more efficiently that is to raise prices in real terms For example Hester Biosciences plans to sell its Peste des Petits Ruminants PPR vaccines at around three cents per dose compared with its global competitors who plan to sell at around ten cents per dose Hesters net profit margins are already approaching 25 percent even despite its Nepal plant which will be manufacturing Hesters PPR vaccines running at a loss because sales of PPR vaccines had not commenced as of October 2019 Margins and earnings could get a significant boost if and when Hester decides to increase the selling price of its PPR vaccines even modestly in the future after its Nepal plant gradually ramps up capacity utilization No wonder lowcost producers are a perennial favorite of Buffett In most cases they are also prosocial businesses and engage in a positivesum game for all stakeholders involved Such firms tend to follow the GARP principle growth at reasonable profitability Just as we search for undervalued or mispriced stocks we also should look out for undervalued or mispriced products and services that have untapped pricing power as both situations eventually tend to correct themselves Significant value can be unlocked over time for the owners in such situations especially when the business is currently operating at low margins because in those cases the percent age gain in profitability is quite high In investing always focus on delta that is on the rate of change in earnings growth and its underly ing quality Aspirational Yet Affordable Brands with Dominant Share of Mind Just as animals flourish in niches people who specialize in some narrow niche can do very well Charlie Munger Sector leaders in a niche area are promising investments especially if they are identified at a small marketcap stage Their products usually enjoy premium pricing and the brand tends to become synonymous with the product category Think Eicher Motors in leisure motorbikes Symphony in air coolers or Page Industries Jockey India in underwear The best competitive advantage is to have no com petitors in customers minds The brand recall should be so strong that it should be difficult to recall the nextclosest competitor These businesses tend to have strong bargaining power with customers and suppliers and operate on negative working capital that is with other peoples money The wording advances from customers in an annual report is a good cue to start digging This type of advance is essentially a form of float which is an unencumbered source of value resulting from the absence of covenants like collateral repayment dates or interest People Calculate Too Much and Think Too Little In certain instances stock price movements quantitative screeners and reported valuation ratios can lead to inaccurate conclusions Computers and artificial intelligence cannot capture certain softer attributes in investing Let me share a few examples 1 As of October 2019 Hester Biosciences was yet to begin generating meaningful revenues from its international PPR vaccine business which means that the entire growth from this highly promising segment has potential for the next many years Yet many investors avoid this stock terming it expensive based on trailing valuations while ignoring the fact that Hesters high trailing pricetoearnings P E ratio is not representative of its true earning power as international orders have not yet started Multi Commodity Exchange of India charges fees based on the value of a transaction rather than on volume A few years back many investors were citing its high PE ratio as the reason for avoiding this stock But this ratio was based on depressed commodity prices prevailing at the time Investors should always evaluate their longterm ideas based on normalized earning power Similar opportunities emerge when the current earnings of a company are depressed because of ongoing expansion expenses which result in an optically high PE ratio Investors who primarily rely on screening tools to generate ideas end up missing such opportunities 2 Receiving voluntary praise from a competitor is always a positive sign for a firm But these softer aspects cannot be captured by quants Excel spreadsheets or screeners 3 The stock of Avanti Feeds abruptly fell 10 percent on the day before the release of its first quarter FY2018 results in the absence of any public news During that same day however its peer Waterbase was going up after releasing its results and another peer IFB Agro was also up in trade This indicated that no negative news pertaining to the industry at large had been reported Generally when the sector leader falls sharply the secondary players suffer from fear by association and fall in sympathy Avanti reported strong earnings the next day in line with my expectations and the stock appreciated significantly after that Develop a feel for the market For example if the leading stocks of a sector are falling sharply even after reporting strong earnings or are going up even after bad earnings the market is trying to tell you something important 4 How a stock closes in trade after an earnings release or any seemingly important event that is reported overnight is much more important than howit initially reacts or opens in trade 5 Many investors feel more confident investing in consumer businesses because of familiarity with their products But consumer preferences can change rapidly and unpredictably Many businesstobusiness companies though not all face much slower changes in customer preferences making financial modeling easier 6 Sometimes analyst reports mindlessly annualize the quarterly or semiannual numbers without accounting for seasonality in the busi ness operations Always take seasonality into consideration when looking at the quarteronquarter growth of a business following its latest quarterly results announcement For example in February 2018 some initial public offering reports on HG Infra Engineering were quoting valuation estimates based on annualized numbers for the first half of FY2018 even though road construction companies derive about 65 percent to 70 percent of their annual earnings in the second half of the fiscal year October to March 7 It often is not the consolidated quarterly results that stock prices react to Rather market participants are primarily interested in only the performance of one or two specific business segments and it is only the operating results of those segments that drive the stock price 8 Seemingly expensive trailing valuations can quickly become cheap when raw materials prices fall sharply Optically inexpensive trailing valuations can quickly become expensive when the price of raw materials rises sharply 9 Be careful about drawing conclusions from high operating margins alone Efficiency in the business is a good reason for such margins to occur Greed cutting corners in dealings with stakeholders and penalizing longterm value creation to prop up shortterm earnings and the stock price are bad reasons for these margins 10 Look for anomalies in plain sight Many parallels exist between the work of a good detective and that of a good investor One of the most pop ular Sherlock Holmes short stories Silver Blaze featured the famous incident of the dog that did not bark Gregory Scotland Yard detective Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention Holmes To the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime Gregory The dog did nothing in the nighttime Holmes That was the curious incident Lets observe the curious incident in early 2018 pertaining to the demerger of Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation CESC Just look at the completely illogical sumoftheparts valuation exercise in which some analysts were engaging for CESC at the time table 291 Analysts who do a sumoftheparts analysis for a conglomerate should understand that if the cash produced from one business is fund ing another business then the sumoftheparts analysis has no meaning If management wants to continue doing this crossfunding of their different businesses they would not do a demerger in the first place Spencers as a separately listed entity following the demerger obviously could not have a negative market value No wonder Charlie Munger has said People calculate too much and think too little TABLE 291 Sum of the parts valuation Business segment Priceshare Rs Valuation method Existing power business 956 1x FY2019 book value Chandrapur power plant 61 15 discount on invested equity Haldia power plant 86 On equity invested CESC property 19 On equity invested Spencers and others 58 Discount for lossmaking retail business 11 The reported earnings in financial statements are becoming less useful for analytical purposes in the modern digital world In his second quarter 2018 letter to Heller House fund clients Marcelo Lima wrote Cheap is a poor proxy for value the new business models Saas software as a service in particularare not well suited to tradi tional GAAP generally accepted accounting principles accounting Heres why if distribution costs are zero the optimal strategy is to gain as many customers for your software product as quickly as possible In digital businesses there are increasing advantages to scale and many of these companies operate in winnertakeall or winnertakemost markets The name of the game is thus to build grow then monetize Frequently this means spending a lot of money in sales and marketing which depresses reported earnings Thus SaaS companies spend to acquire customers upfront and recognize revenue from those customers over many years This mismatch burdens the income statement Some of the most successfuland highest performing stocksin the SaaS world have spent many years growing despite producing no meaningful accounting profits They are very profitable in terms of unit eco nomics and once they stop reinvesting every dollar generated into further growth The traditional method of screening for low PE stocks doesnt work in this scenario2 For these SaaS companies study the incremental unit economicsthat is how much it costs to acquire each customer and how much value they deliver over a span of timeand then analyze what the business margins and cash flows look like at a steady state once the investment phase slows down Then discount those cash flows back to the present Ina February 2018 Harvard Business Review article three professors from the Columbia and Dartmouth business schools Vijay Govindarajan Shivaram Rajgopal and Anup Srivastava summarized their work on accounting for intangible investments Their key finding which builds on Baruch Lev and Feng Gus analysis in their book The End of Accounting is that accounting earnings are practically irrelevant for digital companies Likewise Govindarajan Rajgopal and Srivastava found that reported earnings mean less for younger companies than for older companies because of the different nature of younger companies expenditures In fact they found that eam ings explain only 24 percent of variation in stock returns for a 21st century companywhich means that almost 98 percent of the varia tion in companies annual stock returns are not explained by their annual earnings2 These claims correlate nicely with those published in Lev and Gus book figure 291 The authors found that variations in financial metrics like earnings and book value explain 90 percent of the variations in stock prices for companies that went public between 1950 and 1959 compared with explaining only about 20 percent of the variation for companies that have gone public since 2000 90 80 70 60 50 Percentage R2 40 30 RD

account for those longterm valuecreating expenditures in the same way that it accounts for a routine general expense like office space rents That is all those productive investments the upward sloping line in figure 291 are treated as expenses and are charged against current period earnings which significantly depresses reported profits for highly innovative companies The same mechanism distorts the balance sheet by making assets look artificially low because if something is expensed it never makes its way to the balance sheet as an asset Govindarajan Rajgopal and Srivastava found that intangible investments have surpassed property plant and equipment as the main avenue of capital creation for US companies Yet all these intangible assets are absent from the balance sheet and thus analysts cannot form accurate opinions about firms earning potential Lev identified this lack of information many years ago as the source of a market anomaly that causes highly innovative companies to systematically outperform their less innovative peers This anomaly can be termed the knowledge factor Sidecar Investing From John Templeton making a fortune by buying a basket of penny stocks on the eve of World War II to Warren Buffett selling supercat insurance successful investors have earned extraordinary returns through the unknown and the unknowable and they have done so on a reasoned calculated basis Unknown and unknowable refers to the situation in which both the possible future states of the world and their probabilities are unknown and unknowable Sidecar investing is a term introduced by Richard Zeckhauser in his famous essay Investing in the Unknown and Unknowable5 In this brilliant essay a mustread for all investors Zeckhauser shares many important insights First most investors fail to distinguish between risk and uncertainty When they encounter uncertainty they equate it with risk and shun the stock in question This creates great buying opportunities for value investors who shun risk permanent loss of capital but seek uncertainty on highly favorable terms a large margin of safety Second some types of unknowable situations have been associated with highly profitable outcomes and we can think about these situations systematically People overwhelmingly prefer to take on measurable and quantifiable risk in situations in which they know specific odds rather than an alternative risk scenario in which the odds are completely ambiguous They tend to choose a known proba bility of winning over an unknown probability of winning even if the known probability is low and the unknown probability could be a guarantee of winning This paradox in decision theory in which peoples choices violate the postulates of subjective expected utility is knownas the Ellsberg paradox Fear of the unknown is one of the most potent kinds of fear and the natural reaction is to get as far away as possible from what is feared Unknown unknowns make most of us withdraw from the game These however are also the cir cumstances in which extraordinary returns are possible Readers should study the case study of the most successful investment ever in the history of mankindMasayoshi Sons investment in Alibaba in 1999 which delivered a 6500x return Fortune favors the brave and market prices and valuations tend to reflect our innate tendency to avoid uncertainty One way to think about unknowable situations is to recognize the hugely asymmetric payoffs they offer If you have a chance to multiply your money ten to twenty times and that chance is offset by the possibility that you could lose all of it in that particular commitment then it is a good bet to be exercised provided you are sufficiently diversified This is how to bet in asymmetric payoffs This is the Babe Ruth effect in action Provide for lowprobability out comes Play for highprobability outcomes This applies to both value investors and corporate capital allocators Third big money can be made by those who possess complementary skills These people bring something to the table that we cannot They get deals that we cannot Individuals who lack such skills can still make it big by partnering with people who do possess complementary skills Think of buying shares in Berkshire Hathaway in the 1980s riding along with Warren Buffett and paying nothing to him for the privilege An example that comes to mind is the deal Buffett got from Goldman Sachs when he bought the investment banks preferred stock on favorable terms during the financial crisis of 2008 a 5 billion investment in Goldmans preferred stock and common stock warrants with a 10 percent dividend yield on the preferred and an attractive conversion privilege on the warrants Zeckhauser says that some people can get amazing deals and have the ability to source these transactions They have certain at tributes that attract such deals to them Perhaps they have capital contacts reputation or something innate that a general public markets investor does not have This is akin to an investor riding along in a sidecar pulled by a powerful motorcycle driven by an individual who has complementary skills The more the investor is distinctively positioned to have confidence in the drivers integrity and his motorcy cles capabilities says Zeckhauser the more attractive is the investment Zeckhauser advises that when the opportunity arises to make a sidecar investment on favorable terms alongside such individuals we should not miss it An opportunity for making a sidecar investment may occur when a founder demonstrates complete detachment and objectivity and sells a legacy business which has been an integral part of his or her life in the best interests of the minority shareholders and then begins a fresh entrepreneurial journey through a new entity that is listed on the stock exchange A related pattern is found when the key professional from a promoter group company with a proven track record of strong execution incubates a new business in a previously dor mant listed group entity and infuses personal funds into it through a preferential allotment Yet another opportunity for making a sidecar investment with an individual who has highly complementary skills occurs when such an individual joins an ordinarily run listed company and picks up a majority or a significant minority stake in it This ensures skin in the game Investing in Businesses with a Sector Tailwind Theres a model that I call surfingwhen a surfer gets up and catches the wave and just stays there he can go a long long time Charlie Munger One of the lessons your management has learnedand unfortunately sometimes relearnedis the importance of being in businesses where tailwinds prevail rather than headwinds Warren Buffett Newtons first law of motion states that an object in motion stays in motion Things in motion possess inertia The stock market is charac terized by an analogous property a trend in force tends to remain in force until something occurs to change it In other words the trend is your friend Recognizing the big picture matters as much as correctly identifying the prospects of an individual business According to Adam Parker former US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley the impact of sectorspecific factors on a typical stocks annual return accounts for more than half of a stocks performance Based on my personal investing experiences over the years I have found that it is better to buy a good company in a great sector than a great company in a bad sector In both careers and in investments it helps enormously to pick the right train that is to choose a field with longterm secular growth In his 2005 talk with students at Tuck School of Business Buffett said We come to my second recommendation which is to get on the right train that is moving in the right direction Theres no course in business school called Getting on the Right Train but its really important You can be an average passenger but if you get on the right train it will carry you a long way No awards for bravery are given in investing Dont fight the trends especially the longterm inevitable ones Psychological denial of reality leads people to go broke In other words invest in companies with tailwinds not headwinds Let me illustrate this important in vesting principle through my portfolio holdings 1 Secular growth of housing finance microfinance and private banking industry in India Aavas Financiers CreditAccess Grameen Bandhan Bank AU Small Finance Bank and Ujjivan Small Finance Bank 2 Gradual shift of chemicals manufacturing away from China and toward India Vinati Organics 3 Structural longterm trend of urbanization and increasing financialization of savings in India PSP Projects HDFC Life and HDFC Asset Management Company 4 Planned spending of 76 billion on eradication of PPR disease over a span of fifteen years by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Hester Biosciences 5 Secular growth of aspirational Indias discretionary consumption Bajaj Finance Dixon Technologies SBI Cards Along the way we have the strong tailwind of capitalism at our backs which makes the stock market a positivesum game over the long run as corporations retain earnings and further earn on those retained earnings People obsess about the problems in the world and underestimate the most persistent and bullish longterm phenomenon the constant inherent desire in the human race to improve its current state of being Perhaps the greatest advantage of all in buying highquality businesses without visible ceilings on their growth is that when we do so we give ourselves the chance to profit from the unforeseeable and the incalculable Year after year humankind achieves the impossible but persists in underrating what it can and will accomplish in the future Investing in Businesses That Are About to Complete a Large Expansion Be unreasonable in situations in which an expansion is in the offing Dont settle merely for businesses that are about to complete small brownfield expansions Instead look for businesses undergoing a large greenfield capital expenditure program no business does a large capacity expansion without strong conviction in the future demand for its product and then buy them three to six months ahead of the scheduled completion date Use screening tools to shortlist companies with a large recent increase in capital work in progress on their balance sheet Abig idea I took away from Bruce Greenwalds book Competition Demystified was the concept of local economies of scale which he demonstrated through the case study of Nebraska Furniture Mart I often use the criterion of a large singlelocation facility when select ing an investment in manufacturing businesses For example Hester Biosciences operates Asias largest singlelocation animal biological manufacturing facility Having the entire manufacturing setup in a single location minimizes the cost of logistics When a business with a primarily fixedcost structure scales up its operations the perunit cost becomes smaller operating leverage takes over and net profit grows exponentially The fixed cost per unit becomes low compared with smallscale competitors and it becomes almost impossible for a new entrant to compete on price with the lowestcost incumbent without bleeding losses for a long time Alending business that has just raised a large amount of growth capital should be viewed in the same way as a manufacturing business that has just completed a big capacity expansion In fact equity dilution is not really bad in the case of richly valued and well managed financiers with a high return on equity This is because they are valued on a pricetobook basis As a result their intrinsic value actually increases along with book value after a rights issue a followon offering or a qualified institutional placement This presents a good opportunity to average upward in such lending businesses especially those with good or improving asset quality Lending busi nesses with declining nonperforming assets rising return on equity and improving provision coverage ratio tend to undergo a valuation rerating An expanding pricetobook ratio leads to a virtuous cycle for such businesses which then can raise capital in the future with a lower equity dilution Ina lending business growth is never an issue many people want to borrow from you What really matters in such a highly lever aged business is the risk management practices and asset quality When assessing asset quality investors should pay careful attention to loss given default LGD which is a more comprehensive and appropriate risk measure than nonperforming assets NPAs All things con sidered Id rather invest in a lending institution that has survived a past downcycle than in one that has never been tested in challenging times As the saying goes What doesnt kill you makes you stronger In his 1990 letter Buffett articulated his rationale for investing in Wells Fargo The banking business is no favorite of ours When assets are twenty times equitya common ratio in this industrymistakes that involve only a small portion of assets can destroy a major portion of equity And mistakes have been the rule rather than the excep tion at many major banks Because leverage of 201 magnifies the effects of managerial strengths and weaknesses we have no interest in purchasing shares of a poorlymanaged bank at a cheap price Instead our only interest is in buying into wellmanaged banks at fair prices em phasis added2 Carefully note Buffetts words leverage magnifies the effects of managerial strengths and weaknesses This implies that when ever leverage is high the management factor is critically important Pay Careful Attention to Slow Gradual Changes Cognition misled by tiny changes involving low contrast will often miss a trend that is destiny Charlie Munger Human beings are wired to react to sudden changes in the environment not to slow gradual ones But slow changes both improvements and deteriorations are magnified over time even though they are barely noticeable over short periods This is particularly true in the field of technological disruption which eventually leads to significant upheavals at the macro level Lately scientists and the popular press have been talking about the possibility of Moores law petering out in the medium term The physics of putting evergreater numbers of transistors on silicon chips eventually will meet physical limitations At some point scientists believe it will be extremely difficult and prohibitively expensive for conventional chip technology to sustain the pace dictated by Moores law Some analysts believe that the death of Moores law will signal the end of exponential growth in computing but Ray Kurzweil believes that the evolution of technology will start a new computing paradigm that will continue or accelerate this trend In his deeply profound book The Singularity Is Near Kurzweil writes Most longrange forecasts of what is technically feasible in future time periods dramatically underestimate the power of future developments because they are based on what I call the intuitive linear view of history rather than the historical exponential view Inanonlinear world we all think linearly Promoters Managements Investors Analysts But Munger looks for lollapalooza effects George Soros seeks to profit from reflexivity Nassim Taleb emphasizes the presence of fat tails Peter Thiel talks about power laws All of them are looking to arbitrage between the linear environment in which we evolved and the nonlinear environment that we have created A business should be viewed as an unfolding movie not asa still photograph Warren Buffett The financial community is usually slow to recognize a fundamentally changed condition unless a big name or a colorful single event is publicly associated with that change Philip Fisher Along with the slow and gradual macro changes investors should also be alert to tiny changes at the micro level Be alert to tiny changes like the declaration

the prepared mind There is no alternative to hard work CHAPTER 30 ACKNOWLEDGING THE ROLE OF LUCK CHANCE SERENDIPITY AND RANDOMNESS We are quick to forget that just being alive is an extraordinary piece of good luck a remote event a chance of occurrence of monstrous proportions Imagine a speck of dust next to a planet a billion times the size of earth The speck of dust represents the odds in favor of your being born the huge planet would be the odds against it So stop sweating the small stuff Remember you are a Black Swan Nassim Nicholas Taleb Each of us has what I call an ensemble of stochastic life pathsthe choices we make You make each choice in life based on your under standing of the possibility that it will take you where you want to be But you dont determine the outcome only the probabilities Each path leads to more choices a cascade to echo all the other cascades that rule our lives Choosing the path is the extent of your control beyond that its out of your hands You choose and then life rolls the dice Arthur De Vany The greatest superpower is luck Stan Lee Luck n Success or failure apparently brought by chance rather than through ones own actions What does it take to succeed What are the secrets of the most successful people Judging by the popularity of magazines such as Success Forbes and Entrepreneur interest in these questions is significant We assume that we can learn from successful people because they have certain personal characteristicssuch as talent skill hard work tenacity optimism growth mindset and emotional intelli gencethat got them where they are today But is this assumption correct Lucks role is hidden because outstanding success is spotlighted failure is all around but unpublicized and unseen Jennifer Aniston and Sandra Bullock worked as waitresses before they became movie stars The remaining thousands of waiters and waitresses in Los An geles probably never got a casting call For every Mark Zuckerberg thousands of tech entrepreneurs and employees have little to show for decades of effort In his book How to Get Lucky Max Gunther writes a tour de force on luck chance serendipity and randomness It isnt enough just to be good Youve got to be lucky too Good luck is the essential basic component of success no matter what your personal definition of success may be Luck It blunders in and out of our lives unbidden unexpected sometimes welcome and sometimes not It plays a role in all our affairs often the commanding role No matter how carefully you design your life you cannot know how that design will be changed by the working of random events You can only know the events will occur You can only wait for them and hope they are in your favor Luck is the supreme insult to human reason You cant ignore it yet you cant plan for it Mans grandest and most meticulous designs will fail if they are hit with bad luck but the silliest ventures will succeed with good luck Such eventsgood luck and bad luckare the main shaping forces of human life If you believe you are in perfect control of your life you are kidding yourselj Why do people deny the role of luck For one thing we hate to think we are at the mercy of random happenings We prefer to stay snugly wrapped in the illusion that we control our own destinies Life seems safer when I can say to myself The future will happen as I plan it It wont of course Deep inside we all know it wont But the truth is too scary to contemplate without an illusion to snuggle up against We are culturally conditioned to deny the role of luck Luck isnt meaningful enough We yearn for life to have meaning Acknowledging lucks role takes half the meaning out of it If I do wrong and come toa bad end as a direct result of my own wickedness or weakness the episode is supposed to teach some kind of lesson to me and others But if Im peacefully walking along the street and get run over by a truck nobody learns anything Life is like that much of the time completely random and meaningless Not only college English professors but all the rest of us are uncomfortable with that fact But it is a fact you must look square in the eye if you want to do something about your luck The first step toward improving your luck is to acknowledge that it exists emphasis added Figures 301 and 302 illustrate humilitys role in sustaining success APPRECIATION or Loe SANSE 6F

my bit and acknowledge the significant role of luck in my investing journey Luck was responsible for my multiple big winners during the 2014 bull market in India At the time I had hardly any investing expertise to speak of but still within my portfolio Avanti Feeds went from INR 500 to INR 2410 382 percent Gati went from INR 60 to INR 275 359 percent Symphony went from INR 700 to INR 1200 71 percent VST Tillers went from INR 800 to INR 1740 118 percent Ajanta Pharma went from INR 650 to INR 1350 108 percent Mayur Uniquoters went from INR 230 to INR 440 91 percent Astral Poly Technik went from INR 250 to INR 400 60 percent and Atul Auto went from INR 350 to INR 600 71 percent With the exception of Gati all these stocks had been purchased on borrowed conviction from some intelligentsounding discussion ona prominent investing blog in India called ValuePickr The primary reason for my purchase of all these stocks was my supposedly bril liant personal thought that because these stocks had delivered fabulous returns during the tough economic conditions of the preceding five years I checked this in the Factset database then these stocks logically should deliver even better returns during an economic recov ery As for Gati I naively presumed that if ecommerce grew rapidly in India then Gatis courier business would do quite well I did not even check the quality of the companys earnings Just as I had no personal conviction or good understanding of my choices when buying these stocks I did not have any better insight when selling them Yes this is true This was my pitiful state as an investor at the time even after being present in the markets since 2007 Thad initiated my selfeducation on value investing in 2013 and the power of compounding knowledge had not yet kicked in Many of my friends seniors and peers bought these stocks at far lower prices and obtained big multibagger returns Although all of them had deserved success I was merely a big beneficiary of dumb luck ina bull market Even during the subsequent three years a signifi cant portion of my portfolio returns was primarily driven by the valuation rerating of many smallcap and midcap stocks in India Only luck was responsible for me deploying a meaningful amount of capital in stocks in late 2013 which was exactly when the present multi year bull market in India began Before that time I had invested insignificant sums Be Passionately Curious The best way to approach learning is with childlike curiosity All of us came into this world with abundant curiosity As children we were inherently curious and constantly engaging in joyful discoveries Exploration preceded explanation As we grew up however a fear of looking stupid dampened this curiosity Snap out of it Adopt the motto ABC Always Be Curious As Charlie Munger often says if we want to become smarter the question we need to keep asking is Why why why A questioning mentality is more valuable than a know ing mentality Questions are more productive and useful than commands for shaping ideas and solutions Although you cant force your brain to come up with creative ideas on demand you can program it to launch the imaginative process simply by asking questions It is exciting to be curious because it means you are always discovering something interesting Inspiration often comes from completely un expected sources which is why a curious mind is so beneficial Albert Einstein once wrote to a friend I have no special talents Iam only passionately curious Even Leonardo da Vincis distinguishing and most inspiring trait was his intense curiosity Things are constantly happening within the framework of our selfnarrating story which subjectively unfolds alongside an ex panding universe that we have yet to fully comprehend Dont think about why you question simply dont stop questioning Dont worry about what you cant answer and dont try to explain what you cant know Curiosity is its own reason Arent you in awe when you contemplate the mysteries of eternity of life of the marvelous structure behind reality And this is the miracle of the human mindto use its constructions concepts and for mulas as tools to explain what man sees feels and touches Try to comprehend a little more each day Have holy curiosity Albert Einstein Asa passionately inquisitive individual since childhood I have always engaged in constant inquiry about the world around me This very trait has allowed serendipity to constantly open doors to newer opportunities for me Serendipity led me to discover Eicher Motors through a random reading of a UBS report in November 2013 Serendipity drove me to watch Udayan Mukherjee on CNBC one morning in 2015 when he was speaking about the business recovery in SKS Microfinance now known as Bharat Financial Later in March 2017 Ialso came to understand the longterm growth potential of insurance and asset management industries in India thanks to Mukherjee I randomly viewed a YouTube video in which he was speaking about the longterm secular trend of financialization of savings in the country Ina similar vein I accidently discovered many multibaggers during the course of my investing journey discoveries that were fully driven by chance events or random discussions during the course of my daily life I could go so far as to say that luck chance serendipity and randomness have played a big role in some form or another in all my stock investments to date and likely will continue to do so forever In fact luck is the sole reason that I am alive today and able to share my story I have survived three potentially fatal accidents in my personal lifeonce I fell down the stairs of my building during my childhood years and underwent a surgery once I toppled over while ri bike accident during my MBA college days in Ahmedabad India As a survivor I remain ever grateful for the smallest of things in my life ing an allterrain vehicle in Thailand and miraculously incurred only minor bruises and on a third occasion I was badly injured in a Every new day is Gods gift to me Iam truly blessed Improving Luck Requires the Humility to Acknowledge Its Presence Successful investors appreciate the role of luck They are intellectually honest and conscious of alternative histories that is the silent events in their lives These are the events that could have happened but didnt Let me share a personal example to illustrate this important but hugely underappreciated aspect of our lives On March 28 2016 the Bombay Stock Exchange announced suspension of trading in shares of Cupid Ltd effective March 31 2016 Thad almost 20 percent of my portfolio value in shares of Cupid at the time but the very next day before I had the chance to exit the stock was immediately locked in a lower circuit and continued to hit lower circuits until March 31 after which it was indefinitely suspended from trading What followed over the subsequent few weeks was an extremely tense and uncertain period for Cupids shareholders Even tually the company got a clean chit trading in its shares resumed on April 20 and I was able to exit the stock at close to my original cost price But what if I had not been given the opportunity to exit Warren Buffett credits a large part of his success to his winning the ovarian lottery by being born in America where his skill of allocating capital earned him billions of dollars Similarly I consider myself lucky to have been born and brought up in India a vibrant democracy with a rich diverse culture and a plethora of highgrowth investment opportunities in its stock market where trillions of dol lars of wealth is expected to be created in the future Is there a way to improve our luck once we acknowledge its presence Indeed there is as Gunther explains It turns out that lucky people characteristically organize their lives in such a way that they are in position to experience good luck and to avoid bad luck The lucky approach is to say to yourself Okay Im going to get into this risky situationthis roulette game this mutual fund investment But I am not operating under the delusion that planning will make it turn out my way I see luck looming large in it so I will be careful not to let myself grow too confident and relaxed I will expect rapid change I wont make large irrevocable commit ments Ill stay poised to bail out the minute I see a change I dont like To be lucky in this game you must discard bad hands when you get them You would recognize in the first place that things usually are as bad as they seem In fact often theyre worse You would say to yourself Im willing to be optimistic but Ive got to be shown some reason why And then you would study the situation Is there some likelihood that the problems will go away Or do you have some realistic hope of fixing them If so stay aboard If not get out and go looking for better luck elsewhere Much more often what starts to go wrong stays wrongor goes wronger Ina souring situation with no compelling reason to think things will get better you are always right to cut your loss and go You are right even when in retrospect you turn out to have been wrong2 Gunthers concluding words remind me of what Buffett has said about his experiences with difficult businesses Theres never just one cockroach in the kitchen3 You can increase your surface area for good luck by taking appropriate action Many people think that successful people are simply born lucky Gunther shows us how some people get luckier than others by arranging their lives in certain characteristic patterns They tend to position themselves in the path of onrushing luck They tend to go where events are moving fastest and where they can find their lucky break They try their hand at multiple ventures with lowrisk and highpayoff characteristics They surround themselves with smarter and wiser people When pursuing their goals they always leave some room for serendipity They do not ignore the importance of accidental discoveries eg events parties meetings conferences and chance happenings and they keep an open mind to all possibili ties They take calculated risks They stick with their initial convictions but not when all hope is lost They believe in the dictum Strong beliefs loosely held In short they move with life not against it As a result lucky people are able to take advantage of lifes good breaks while minimizing the effects of bad breaks Obvious responses to opportunities and circumstances rather than studied decisions have put me on the particular roads I have followed Herbert Simon All of us have the opportunity to be lucky because beyond having the basics of health and sustenance luck simply comes down toa series of choices If you live ina free society you are lucky Luck surrounds you every day you constantly have lucky things happen to you whether or not you recognize it Lucky people are those who acknowledge just how fortunate they are and feel grateful for what they have If you want to feel rich just count all the gifts you have that money cant buy In my view this selfrealization is the most important step toward being lucky You may not be doing well at your job or with your investments but if you have a loving family and good health its worth being grateful for already having some of the most precious things in life As Nick Maggiulli writes Think about the story you tell yourself about yourself In all the lives you could be living in all of the worlds you could simulate how much did luck play a role in this one Have you gotten more than your fair share Have you had to deal with more struggles than most I ask you this question because accepting luck as a primary determinant in your life is one of the most freeing ways to view the world Why Because when you realize the magnitude of happenstance and serendipity in your life you can stop judging yourself on your outcomes and start focusing on your efforts Its the only thing you can control emphasis added Fooled by Randomness What you should learn when you make a mistake because you did not anticipate something is that the world is difficult to anticipate Thats the correct lesson to learn from surprisesthat the world is surprising Daniel Kahneman Because logic thrives on cause and effect analytic thinkers often confuse coincidence with causality and correlation with causation A typical byproduct of the analyzers need for causality can be seen when the talking heads pundits and experts review the days market action In reality the market is moving up or down on any given day because of a multitude of interrelated factors that are too complex diffuse and intangible to be identified In his book The Zurich Axioms Max Gunther masterfully demonstrates how a complex adaptive system like the stock market is char acterized by complete randomness because human behavior is utterly unpredictable The fact is nobody has the faintest idea of what is going to happen next year next week or even tomorrow It is of the utmost impor tance that you never take economists market advisers or other financial oracles seriously Of course they are right sometimes and that is what makes them dangerous Each of them after being in the prophecy busi ness for a few years can point proudly to a few guesses that turned out right Amazing everybody says What never appears in the prophets publicity is a reminder of all the times when he or she was wrong Its easy to be a prophet the noted economist Dr Theodore Levitt once told Business Week You make twentyfive predic tions and the ones that come true are the ones you talk about Not many seers are that frank but all would privately agree with Dr Levitts formula for success Economists market advisers political oracles and clairvoyants all know the basic rule by heart Ifyou cant forecast right forecast often Not all oracles have been able to organize the annual forecastrevising dance of the economists but all are followers of the basic rule They all forecast often and hope nobody scrutinizes the results too carefully It is easy to get dazzled by a successful prophet for there is a hypnotic allure in the supposed ability to look into the future This is especially true in the world of money A seer who enjoys a few years of frequently right guesses will attract an enormous following One of the traps moneyworld prophets fall into is that they forget they are dealing with human behavior They talk as though things like the inflation rate or the ups and downs of the Dow are physical events of some kind Looking at such a phenomenon as a physical event an oracle can understandably succumb to the illusion that it will be amenable to forecasting The fact is of course that all money phenomena are manifestations of human behavior An oracle can always cry unforeseeable events in explanation of a forecast that turns out wrong But that is just the trou ble Every forecast has the possibility of unforeseeable events ahead of it No forecast about human behavior can ever be compounded of 100 percent foreseeable events Every prediction is chancy None can ever be trusted Disregard all prognostications In the world of money which is a world shaped by human behavior nobody has the foggiest notion of what will happen in the future Mark that word Nobody Money seems cool rational amenable to reasoned analysis and manipulation If you want to get rich it would seem that you need only find a sound rational approach A Formula Everybody is looking for this Formula Unfortunately there isnt one The truth is that the world of money is a world of patternless disorder utter chaos Patterns seem to appear in it from time to time as do patterns in a cloudy sky or in the froth at the edge of the ocean But they are ephemeral They are not a sound basis on which to base ones plans Itis surprising how many smart people allow themselves to be fooled by the Gamblers Fallacy Toss a coin enough times and sooner or later you are going to have a long run of heads But there is nothing orderly about this run You cannot know in ad vance when it will start And when it has started you cannot know how long it will continue And so it is with roulette the horses the art market or any other game in which you put money at risk Ifyou play long enough you will enjoy winning streaksperhaps some memorable ones But there is no orderly way in which you can cash in on these streaks You cant see them coming and you cant predict their duration They are merely one more part of the chaos Countless speculators and gamblers have been bankrupted by failing to quit while they were ahead The Gamblers Fallacy tends to encourage that failure for it engenders the feeling that one is temporarily invincible That is a dangerous feeling to have Nobody is invincible not even for half a second It might be hard indeed to remain perfectly rational after an experience like that emphasis added 5 This is exactly what Buffett was referring to in his 2000 letter when he wrote The line separating investment and speculation which is never bright and clear becomes blurred still further when most market participants have recently enjoyed triumphs Nothing se dates rationality like large doses of effortless money Investors succumb to such folly because they fail to recognize one of the most powerful forces in the world of finance Reversion to the Mean Reversion to the mean says that an event that is not average will be followed by an event that is closer to the average This principle is significant in those activities or situations in which some element of randomness is involved The intensity with which mean reversion affects an activity is directly proportional to the element of luck controlling the outcome in that activity Individual sports and games like running swimming or chess are activities in which luck plays a relatively small role They are dominated by skill resulting in consistent and predictable outcomes Stock market investing is an activity in which luck plays a significant role Consider the typical process that many retail investors follow They look at a fund managers most recent few years of performance and invest their money in his or her mutual fund if it has been a recent outperformer And then their chosen fund starts underperforming the benchmark for the next few years Frustrated these investors pull out the money and find another fund manager based on the same criteriathe manager with the most recent few years outperformance A similar episode is repeated The investors are completely baffled as to why their chosen funds performance deterio rates immediately after they put their money into it Mean reversion my friend Most fund buyers look at past performance first then at the managers reputation then at the riskiness of the fund and finally if ever at the funds expenses The intelligent investor looks at those same thingsbut in the opposite order Jason Zweig In the stock market periods of aboveaverage returns usually are followed by periods of belowaverage returns and vice versa Investors tend to let their emotions get the better of them and chase the latest investment fad or sell when they should be buying As per behavioral research firm Dalbar the SP 500 returned 56 percent per year in the 20year period ending in 2018 while the average investor return in all US equity funds was just 19 percent per yeara significant underperformance of 37 percent per annum for 20 years caused entirely due to the investors own harmful behaviors and their poor attempts at market timing also known as the behavior gap2 Buffett is referring to nothing but mean reversion when he says Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fear ful This is exactly why one should not be swayed by outcomes that is by a few recent years of high return performance by any money manager or investment advisor If that is the case then how can we separate luck chance and randomness from true skill when evaluating investment track records Lord Krishna provides us with the answer The Big Investing Lesson from the Bhagavad Gita Karmanye vadhikaraste ma phaleshou kada chana Ma karma phala hetur bhurmatey sangostva akarmani Bhagavad Gita In this verse from the Bhagavad Gita Lord Krishna explains to Arjuna that he must perform his duties as the latter was unwilling to fight the Mahabharata war Translated it reads You have the right to perform your actions but you are not entitled to the fruits of the actions Do not let the fruit be the purpose of your actions and therefore you wont be attached to not doing your duty Krishna asks Arjuna to continue performing his duties without being attached to the result of his actions His teaching is encapsu lated in the idea of karma yoga or the discipline of action The word karma is derived from the Sanskrit root kri meaning to do This is the big lesson for all investors Focus on the karmathe process and actionand not on the outcome Numerous research studies have identified a common trait among successful professionals in fields of probabilistic activity they all emphasize process over outcome Whatever the future holds we will stick to our process We are not guaranteed of getting what we want all the timefar from it but we believe it is the best foundation for getting what we want over time Chuck Akre Although the returns outcome may be evident for everyone to see investors rarely ask whether that outcome was the result of skill a sound investment process or plain randomness If you focus only on the outcome you are less likely to achieve it Instead if you focus on adhering to a sound process the outcome will take care of itself in the long term although the shortterm results almost always will be driven by luck Over the long run a sound process can be counted on to deliver desirable results in a sustained manner and produce more reliable outcomes Robert Rubin the former US Treasury secretary said it best Any individual decision can be badly thought through and yet be successful or exceedingly well thought through but be unsuccessful because the recognized possibility of failure in fact occurs But over time more thoughtful decisionmaking will lead to better overall results and more thoughtful decisionmaking can be encouraged by evaluating decisions on how well they were made rather than on outcome2 CHAPTER 31 THE EDUCATION OF A VALUE INVESTOR like people admitting they were complete stupid horses asses I know Ill perform better if rub my nose in my mistakes This is a won derful trick to learn Charlie Munger The chief difference between a fool and a wise man is that the wise man learns from his mistakes while the fool never does Phil Fisher Bias from Overinfluence of Authority Copypasting is often respectably known as imitating or cloning or coattailing Some people also call it inspired action Of course its always good to get inspired by others But the problem occurs when we allow others to think on our behalf and when we blindly copy clonecoattail what others have doneare doing or saidare saying Its a natural human bias to act this way especially when we are working under the influence of an authority or someone who has had success in the past Vishal Khandelwal During 2016 Ibought a stock solely on the basis of the rationale of a peer who I admired and looked up to for his investing skills A few weeks later the stock fell sharply post weak quarterly earnings and I exited my position at a 14 percent loss because I lacked the personal conviction to hold To rub salt into the wounds the stock then doubled in less than ten months Ouch You can borrow someones idea but you will never be able to borrow their conviction Hard work has no alternative I often have had people strongly recommend a stock to me as a great longterm buyand then they have sold it the very next week or month I have no right to blame them if I lose money on their recommendations We are personally responsible for our decisions Learn from everyones best qualities but never blame them for your losses As Jim Rohn aptly put it The day you graduate from childhood to adulthood is the day you take full responsibility for your life It is fine to be aware of the investment choices of investors we admire and respect but we should always do the necessary study at our end and pull the buy trigger only if the concerned business falls within our circle of compe tence and offers a good margin of safety Personally speaking the real joy and thrill of investing comes from the underlying research and discovery process When you blindly clone someone elses stock picks without doing any due diligence you forgo the very aspect that makes value investing such an in tellectually satisfying activity As Vishal Khandelwal puts it You will make mistakes even when you invest in original ideas but at least those mistakes would be your own and maybe leave you with worthwhile lessons But when you make mistakes just because the thesis of the one you cloned was wrong whom do you lay the blame on And what lessons do you learn Over time you become a 20 percent clone each of the five people you associate with the most This is a good way to live but only when you choose the right people to associate with This is also true in investing Choose the right people then clone their behavior thinking process and orientationand never blindly their ideasand you will become like them over time emphasis added All of us have obeyed an authority figure at some point in our lifeparents teachers policemen and so on Obeying authority has several advantages in situations in which we require guidance But blindly following authority can result in serious problems best exem plified by one of the most famous psychological studies of obedience the Milgram experiment During 2013 I bought shares of Subex solely on the basis of a renowned market experts recommendation on business television The stock promptly crashed by more than 50 percent within a few months of my purchase and I exited it at a significant realized loss I wish I had before this read Benjamin Franklins words It is the first duty of every citizen to question authority In hindsight this was a valuable experience as I never again invested on the basis of recommendations by experts The people we read about and see in financial media create authority bias and a halo effect They are well dressed speak fluent English and use complex jargonall ingredients of drama Drama always sells Many of these experts do not have any credible longterm track record Yet they never hesitate to tout their sureshot recommendations In other words they engage in what Charlie Munger calls twaddle tendency and possess superficial chauffeur knowledge This leads to serious problems for the audience as the socalled expert or authority figure often turns out to be grossly wrong At times conflicts of interest are involved and the expert willfully acts in an unethical manner Questioning authority is an effective antidote to this problem as shown by Robert Cialdini in his book Influence When confronted with a situation in which you agree with an expert pause and ask two important questions 1Is this authority truly an expert This question helps verify the credibility of the expert 2 How truthful can we expect this expert to be This question should help us understand the experts incentives and any potential conflicts of interest before we give any credence to the advice Although it is good to learn from the best in the business never blindly follow the recommendation of anyone without adequate inquiry reasoning and due diligenceno matter how renowned the expert is Thankfully markets are efficient enough to make expert commentary look dumb in the morning and dumber by the afternoon Bias from Anchoring As soon as our intuition gets fixated with a numberand that can be any numberit sticks with us Most of our decisionmaking errors re sult from mental shortcuts that are a normal part of the way we think The brain uses mental shortcuts to simplify the very complex tasks of information processing and decisionmaking Anchoring is the psychologists term for one shortcut the brain uses The brain approaches complex problems by selecting an initial reference point the anchor and making small changes as additional information is received and processed Vishal Khandelwal During 2013 I bought the stocks of CORE Education and Wockhardt only because their stock prices had sharply fallen by more than 50 percent in a very short time span In the case of Wockhardt the fall had taken less than three months whereas in the case of CORE Edu cation the fall had happened in a single day I excitedly bought the stocks of both these companies without having any idea about their underlying value Both of them promptly crashed by another 50 percent after my purchase and I exited both at near the bottom for that year I was the living example of Phil Fishers dictum that the stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything and the value of nothing2 I should have noted that a stock that is down 95 percent first falls 90 percent and then goes down 50 percent more One of the worst ways to identify undervalued stocks is using the distance from the fiftytwoweek high price But i the easiest and hence most frequently used methods among investors Investors often anchor themselves not only to the stock price but also to the past actions of the promoter even if the promoter has since been reformed and has taken corrective steps like closing down a bad division improving investor communications or profession alizing the board Learn to develop empathy for the promoter As Oscar Wilde said Every saint has a past every sinner has a future Sometimes even if the underlying business model has undergone a significant positive transformation investors tend to anchor to the past history of the business Until 2016 Manappuram Finance was historically a volatile gold loan business but the management changed the companys busi ness model to giving shortterm gold loans which significantly reduced the underlying business volatility Many investors overlooked this important change and bought the stock only after it had discounted most of the new positive changes in the companys business model We live in a world in process and it changes continuously every single minute Nothing stays the same Thomas Russo likes to give the analogy of a sevenhundredyearold temple in Japan The temple is made of wood and none of the wood is seven hundred years old as the pieces have been replaced numerous times over the years But we still talk about the temple as if it is seven hundred years old In the stock markets we see the effect of change in similar ways Consider the SP 500 one of the most frequently cited market indexes On average over the past fifty years more than twenty companies are swapped out each year Yet investors cite and treat the SP 500 as if it were a monolithic unchanging object It clearly isnt The constituents of the SP 500 of 2020 are completely different from the SP 500 of 2000 even though our language infers otherwise when we say things like The SP 500 is trading at a premiumdiscount to its ten year average If the first time we are introduced to an investment idea we look at its longterm price chart and see that it has consistently declined for the past ten years we are likely to subconsciously label it as a dog stock Thereafter this taints our view of the business even when the underlying facts might have changed profoundly for the better So perfectly good companies can be shunned for no good reason When ever you study a fallen angel from the past mentally date it and you will observe interesting results Many investors scoffed at the idea of investing in Manappuramyp 1 because they couldnt get Manappuramyo 3 out of their heads Mentally date each business you study and acknowledge reality for what it isa mere pointintime observation Investors hold an irrational bias of always trying to buy shares in round numbers those round numbers become the anchor even though some cash may be left over after such a transaction Never ignore the opportunity cost of that small amount of idle cash When compounded over decades it can amount toa significant sum Another common and highly irrational anchoring bias among investors occurs when they aim to buy a stock which they expect to go up hundreds of percentage points over time only at an arbitrarily fixed desired purchase price that is a bit lower than the current market price These investors act penny wise and pound foolish and end up incurring huge opportunity costs in many cases similar to those who defer a justified sale of a stock solely to make it a longterm holding and save some shortterm capital gains tax For the great majority of transactions being stubborn about a tiny fractional difference in the price can prove extremely costly Philip Fisher Acommon anchor is the original cost price of a stock which makes investors hang on to loser investments in the hope of exiting once they break even These investors overlook Phil Fishers warning on the huge costs of this bias More money has probably been lost by investors holding a stock they really did not want until they could at least come out even than from any other single reason If to these actual losses are added the profits that might have been made through the proper reinvestment of these funds if such reinvestment had been made when the mistake was first realized the cost of selfindulgence be comes truly tremendous Most investors wait to recover whats gone rather than retaining whats left They dont realize that loss recovery does not necessar ily have to be made from the same stock on which the loss was made If the story has gone wrong simply book your losses and move on to a better opportunity Continuity of compounding is the key to success in this longterm game After buying a stock forget what you paid or this knowledge will forever affect your judgment Another faulty anchor is the past price of a stockthat is the point at which an investor originally contemplated buying it but failed to pull the trigger after which point the stock has appreciated significantly Missing out on an early opportunity creates regret That regret often is unwarranted because for a truly outstanding business multiple opportunities to buy the stock exist By definition a hundredbagger is a tenbagger twice over Even if someone bought it after it became 10x it still went up another 10x This shows the importance of actively keeping up with a companys story even after you have exited it Think of investments not as disconnected events but as continuing sagas that need to be reevaluated periodically for new twists and turns in the plot Unless a company goes bankrupt the story is never over One of the most counterintuitive ideas in investing is averaging upward or adding to a winning position also known as pyramid ing If we are invested in a great business that will be worth several times its current market cap over time an investors mind evolves into thinking in terms of market cap rather than stock price in the medium to long term then we must not hesitate to add more shares at a higher sometimes much higher price than our original cost basis Our focus as investors should always be on expected returns based on the current price This applies to selling as well Selling a big winner from our portfolio is never easy because we tend to get emotionally attached to it over the years After all it has been responsible for our wealth creation But a stock does not know that we own it Just as we cling to outdated beliefs we hang on to these stocks because we remain fixated on meaningless anchors like our lower original cost price But the investor of today does not benefit from yesterdays growth Anchoring bias afflicts analysts as well In the investment world anchoring explains why an earnings surprise typically follows prior surprises Analysts tend to slowly adjust earnings numbers for a company in their valuation models No one likes to acknowledge that they were wrong especially if the change requires making a complete aboutface As a result change tends to be a slow process of gradual adjustment Surprise after surprise Envy and Ego Its not greed that drives the world but envy Warren Buffett Once you get something that works fine in your life the idea of caring terribly that somebody else is making money faster strikes me as insane Charlie Munger There is a complicating factor that makes the handling of investment mistakes more difficult This is the ego in each of us Phil Fisher Failure to ignore and avoid the temptation that comes from watching other people get rich thanks to a sharp rise in the prices of their stock holdings may lead to the destruction of your wealth if you fall prey to the fear of missing out Even the legendary Isaac Newton suc

httpsbambooinnovatorcom20130404isaacnewtons nightmareduringthesouthseastockbubbledec1718dec1721 Iwish I had known this story earlier In late 2015 I bought shares of Capital Trust only because a close friend recently had made more than 150 percent on it in less than a year As Charles Kindleberger says There is nothing so disturbing to ones wellbeing and judg ment as to see a friend get rich I did not want to get left behind in this competitive race with my close friend so I bought the stock of Capital Trust even though I did not properly understand its underlying business Within two months of my purchase the stock price cor rected by almost 30 percent and I exited it in panic To add insult to injury the stock then tripled in less than eight months Ouch Envy is the only one of the seven deadly sins that offers no upside Envious people are always miserable because envy has only downside risks and envy offers no upside reward We are unnecessarily influenced even when others are playing a different game than we are Do not compare yourself with others The only person you need to be better than today is the person you were yesterday Competing with others makes you bitter Competing with yourself makes you better Great wisdom can be found in Ernest Hemingways words There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man true nobility is being superior to your former self Sometimes our ego makes us bypass a stock simply because an investing peer bought it many years ago at next to the stocks lowest price or at its lowest price in the past year or even the past month We stupidly anchor ourselves to this peers low purchase price and refuse to assess the prospects for the stock at the current market price Also during an ego tussle with a peer investor for any random per sonal reason we tend to ignore his or her publicly available solid stock recommendations because of envy intellectual ego and sometimes even anger and hatred This is mighty foolish behavior The stock does not know who owns it Avoid imposing personal emotions and opinions about others onto an investment decision This will only lead to forgone profits and lost opportunities and significantly erode your longterm net worth I have committed all these asininities at some point of time in the past and have suffered both financially and emotionally You should not As Munger says You dont have to pee on an electric fence to learn not to do it Successful investing is investing that lets you sleep peacefully at night Success is not about who makes the highest returns or who makes the most money It is about achieving our financial goals in a timely manner with the lowest possible risk When practiced in a truly honest and sincere manner value investing not only leads to great wealth but also makes us better human beings With the passage of time we learn to recognize that value investing is not merely about stocks and business fundamentals Itis a life discipline Liking and Disliking Tendency When we have a negative opinion about the person delivering the message we close our minds to what they are saying and miss a lot of learning opportunities because of it Likewise when we have a positive opi much vetting Both are bad ion of the messenger we tend to accept the message without Annie Duke In Influence Cialdini talks about a subtle but highly insidious bias liking tendency We tend to like those who are physically attractive popular or cooperative or people we have positive associations with and those who are similar to us in background opinion lifestyle interest attitude looks values or beliefs We like and trust anything familiar Most of us prefer to say yes to the requests made by some one we know and like It is natural to ignore the faults of those we find likeable and to do the opposite with people we dont like According to Munger LikingLoving Tendencyacts as a conditioning device that makes the liker or lover tend 1 to ignore the faults of and comply with wishes of the object of his affection 2 to favor people products and actions merely associated with the object of his affection and 3 to distort other facts to facilitate love In contrast in the case of disliking bias we tend to ignore the virtues of the concerned subject and to distort facts to maintain our negative view In investing always consciously separate the stock from the personality of the individual at the helm of the company Concentrate on the merits and economics of the underlying business Look at the facts and assess the situation objectively This will save you from making many costly mistakes I wish I had read Cialdinis book before I made my investment in Virat Crane Industries in 2016 I felt emo tionally attached to its founder Grandhi Subba Rao after I read about his life story of hardship struggle and perseverance My strong liking bias for the promoter in turn drove confirmation bias and I began to justify my entry into the stock by considering only the positive points and completely sidelining various negative aspects such as low margins and relatedparty transactions even though I was aware of them Conversely I once displayed disliking bias by delaying my decision to buy the stock in a great business just because I did not like the rude verbal tone of its promoter on television This was completely irrational behavior The business had good economics and the pro moter had a clean corporate governance track record Ahighly capable CEO may be arrogant loud flamboyant and smoke cigars whereas another CEO might be humble introverted and a selfdisciplined individual of high moral character We tend to be biased toward people who display qualities we admire or who are similar to us but the people we like are not necessarily the people who have the capabilities to execute and deliver results Emotions and expenses are two of the biggest enemies of an investor and in several instances in my investing career I paid the price for getting overly emotional about the individual at the helm of a company and acting on my subjective opinion In all of those cases I did not make any money from the stock and incurred a big opportunity cost while holding it I willfully ignored the various headwinds each of those busi nesses were facing and I consciously turned a blind eye to their problems when I should have been objective and unbiased in my evalua tion Always strive to disentangle the facts of a situation from the elements of human psychology StressInfluence Tendency and Cognitive Dissonance Stress n a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or very demanding circumstances In the fastpaced world of the stock market adrenaline tends to produce faster and more extreme reactions Some stress can im prove performance but heavy stress often leads to dysfunction in our cognitive apparatus One form of stress is cognitive dissonance We experience this type of stress when we simultaneously hold onto two contradictory thoughts beliefs opinions or attitudes This dissonance often leads to illogical and irrational actions A personal example from my invest ing journey illustrates this experience In November 2016 I sold my entire holding in SKS Microfinance now known as Bharat Financial because I believed that its micro finance business which depended heavily on cash collections would be adversely affected by the Indian governments demonetization announcement and that it would result in a spike in SKSs nonperforming assets I was experiencing severe mental stress at the time as SKSs stock price was rapidly falling off a cliff But what I did immediately after my sale of SKss stock exemplified cognitive dissonance at its finest I deployed the sale proceeds into buying shares of Manappuram Finance because I had been closely following it over the past few months and had been enthused by the prospects of its fastgrowing microfinance subsidiary Fortunately I realized my folly quickly and exited the stock at a minor loss Aremedy to stressinfluence tendency is to delay making decisions until the time at which you feel less stressed Give yourself a coolingoff period and take stock of the situation when you are feeling calm and relaxed And then peacefully think over your decision Ensure that you refer to your checklist if it is a critical decision Loss Aversion During a previous instance I had put in a stoploss order for Goa Carbon on the morning of its results day I wanted to preserve my quick profits of more than 50 percent which I had earned within just a few months of my purchase The stock market is an auctiondriven mechanism and stock prices often fluctuate sharply on either side many times just plain randomly My stop loss was triggered for no ap parent reason within minutes of my placing the order Goa Carbon reported stellar results an hour after that and the stock shot up in the latter half of the trading session and then went on to rise more than 100 percent within just a few months of that date Ouch The reason for the stoploss order on HEG discussed earlier in the book was valid because I was uncertain about the impact of the potential imposition of the export duty on it But in the case of Goa Carbon my actions were completely irrational Just a week before my sale I had become aware of the companys improved prospects figure 312

It does not make sense to put stoploss orders on our longterm secular growth stocks but nothing is wrong with using them for shortterm commodity holdings during periods of uncertainty with regard to their prospects especially if we are sitting on big profits In both cases however the same fundamental principle applies Future prospects always drive stock prices not past reported earnings Be cause I was aware of the improved prospects for Goa Carbon in the coming quarters as a result of the recent surge in its calcined petroleum coke product prices it was completely contradictory behavior to even think about placing a stoploss order just ahead of the companys re sults announcement for the previous quarter What drove this irrational behavior What drove my desire to preserve my existing profits on a holding by placing a stoploss order The answer lies in an attribute intrinsic to all humans and the overarching theory that forms the bedrock for most biases in behav ioral finance Loss aversion Human beings are more motivated by the thought of losing something than by the thought of gaining something of equal value This is especially true under conditions of uncertainty The threat of potential loss plays a significant role in our decisionmaking and we have a natural tendency to be loss averse Or in Mungers words The quantity of a mans pleasure from a tendollar gain does not exactly match the quantity of his displea sure from a tendollar loss2 This is the foundational principle of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tverskys prospect theory figure 313 ProspectTheory Kahneman Tversky More value Reference point 100 Losses loss Gains 100 gain Losing 100 hurts more than gaining fl a 100 yields pleasure Less value said Contains 1 percent fat it would trigger a different response in us Similarly consider an example of winning 1000 and then losing 900 oft versus losing 1000 and winning 900 backwe are likely to be happier that we only lost 100 versus the outcome in which we only won 100 Framing is an outcome of our aversion to losses Evolution has programmed our brain to seek loss minimization instead of gain maximization In investing narrow framing a variant of the framing effect is our inability to zoom out ina given situation We like win ning more than losing and we keep an internal score for each stock in our portfolio We maintain a separate mental account for each of our stocks and we want to close every future sale transaction only with a gain Instead of looking at overall portfolio performance we try to gain from every single stock This narrow framing is known as the disposition effect and it results in selling winners and holding on to losers As Peter Lynch puts it this is the equivalent of cutting the flowers and watering the weeds Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein take the idea of aversion to loss one step further They explain that investors also suffer from myopic loss aversion the more often we evaluate our portfolios the more likely we are to see losses And the more often we see losses the more often we experience loss aversion which then becomes a vicious cycle Financial losses are processed in the same area of the brain that responds to mortal danger Investors should learn the big lesson from Buffetts insurance underwriting practices always think in terms of expected value Be risk averse but do not be loss averse that is do not be afraid to take calculated risks Investing is not a business in which every investment is profitable Most investors find this to be decisively true but difficult to accept If you are obsessed with individual wins and losses then you will end up being miserable even if your overall portfolio performs well Occasional losses are part of the game so diversify prudently to ensure that no single loss has a major adverse impact on your portfolio in percentage terms and the risk of ruin is not possible Always zoom outthink in terms of percentage changes in your overall wealth rather than absolute value changes in your individual stocks Re member you may look at your portfolio in horror on some days but not decades Greed and Fear October This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks The others are July January September April November May March June December August and February Mark Twain The degree of ones emotion varies inversely with ones knowledge of the factsthe less you know the hotter you get Bertrand Russell The vividness of an event acts as an impediment in our logical reasoning because of our tendency to overweigh the importance of a vivid event and to underweigh the more important but nosovivid gradual changes taking place on a daily basis For example most people would be highly surprised to know that in 2016 mosquitos killed more people per day on average than sharks killed cumulatively over the preceding one hundred years If the said event is recent and more easily available to recall it can potentially lead to some hasty and rash decisions These events tend to take place during times of excessive or overblown coverage of a dramatic media event when investors bypass their checklists because they experience an adrenaline rush and end up making hurried decisions InJune 2016 immediately after the Brexit verdict I sold 5 percent of my existing holdings in Eicher Motors to buy a put option on Yes Bank which had nearterm plans to raise 1 billion through a share sale I thought the global markets would crash as Brexit was being termed by many experts on television the biggest political event since World War II If something is too much in the news it is already discounted in the price This made me nervous but I decided to capitalize on the widespread fear to make a quick buck I thought that once my put options on Yes Bank surged in value I would sell them and buy back even more shares of Eicher Motors than I had temporar ily sold I had it all figured out in a logical manner How could I lose The very next week stock markets globally had their biggest rally in many years All those fearmongering experts were now com pletely conspicuous by their absence in the media and conveniently replaced by hypercharged bulls on business television The stock of Eicher Motors surged in price and the value of my put option on Yes Bank promptly crashed to nearly zero Ouch GreedBvuy REPEAT UNTIL Brote Source Behavior Gap I know what these emotions figure 314 feel like because I committed many atrocities in my initial investing years 1 Trying to make some quick money by taking a loan from the broker to buy shares in a hot

publicized joint venture or partnership with a global giant in its industry without bothering to look at the economics of the arrangement In the hands of a good storyteller almost every stock looks

at nearly 100000 stock trades made by retail investors at a major discount brokerage firm from 1987 through 1993 They found on average that the stocks these investors bought underperformed the market by 27 percentage points over the subsequent year whereas the stocks they sold out performed the market by 05 points in the subsequent year Similarly in a paper published by the Brookings Institution economists Josef Lakonishok Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny showed that the stock trades made by pension fund managers subtracted 078 percent from the returns they would have earned by keeping their portfolios constant2 When we trade excessively the only people who become rich are the intermediaries and brokers Consider a startling calculation to open your eyes to this fact Assume that both you and the intermediary can earn 8 percent per year but you incur frictional costs amount ing to 4 percent of your portfolio each year Meanwhile the intermediaries invest their commissions at 8 percent

my investing journey because I consider them to be my greatest teachers and the lessons learned helped me improve significantly over the years I have a deep appreciation for the valuable experience and wisdom that each loss has brought me There are no mistakes in life only lessons When you adopt a positive mindset you never lose You either win or you learn Good judg ment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment Ihave had a great deal of experience Investing isnt a game of perfection Its a game of continuous improvement Making quick money through a lucky trade early on is the worst way to win The bad habit that it reinforces often leads to a lifetime of losses Beginners luck often turns out to be beginners curse in the field of investing An early and manageable failure is a blessing Get most of your investing mistakes out of the way while youre young and have a significant amount of human capital but little in the way of financial capital According to Otto Von Bismarck Only a fool learns from his own mistakes The wise man learns from the mistakes of others Munger agrees The more hard lessons you can learn vicariously instead of from your own terrible experiences the better off you will be Thope the vicarious learning from my mistakes benefits my readers in their lives and investing careers CONCLUSION UNDERSTANDING THE TRUE ESSENCE OF COMPOUNDING Life is like a snowball The important thing is finding wet snow and a really long hill Warren Buffett Understanding both the power of compound interest and the difficulty of getting it is the heart and soul of understanding a lot of things Charlie Munger have come to realize that the best things to learn from Warren Buffett have nothing to do with investing Read reread and reflect on these words from him You only get one mind and one body And its got to last a lifetime Now its very easy to let them ride for many years But if you dont take care of that mind and that body theyll be a wreck forty years later Its what you do right now today that determines how your mind and body will operate ten twenty and thirty years from nowt These are great words to live by I have yet to come across a better example of longterm thinking with respect to the daily decisions that eventually have an enormous impact on ones life Now that you have read this I want you to think for a moment Are you creating habits and taking actions that will support your body and mind for the rest of your life Are you putting systems in place so you can spend more time on the things that really matter to you in your life Many of us aspire to become successful but lack the blueprint to do so Being successful doesnt mean only making truckloads of money Money without health is pointless Money with no good relationships will leave you lonely We spend a lot of time focusing on compounding our financial capital but we overlook the fact that social and intellectual capital also compound Investing in yourself in your relationships and in your understanding of the world pays massive dividends over time Understand what is truly important to you and pursue your dreams with full dedication in a principled manner Everything you are looking for is closer than you think but some times you have to go on a journey to find it And in your journey the power of compounding will help you achieve what you are striving for becoming happier healthier better wealthier smarter and more honorable Compounding Positive Thoughts Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe it can achieve Thoughts are things And powerful things at that when mixed with definiteness of purpose and burning desire can be translated into riches Napoleon Hill Positive thoughts generate the consistent energy we need to reach our longterm goals Our mind automatically generates thoughts related to the information we consume Even if were adept at avoiding negativity and have trained ourselves to be relentlessly positive when it comes to sensationalism our basic nature cant resist Media masters understand that They know your nature in many ways bet ter than you The media has always used shocking and sensational headlines to draw attention Your mind is like an empty glass itll hold anything you put into it You put in sensational news negative headlines talkshow rants and youre pouring dirty water into your glass If youve got dark dismal worrisome water in your glass everything you create in your mind will be filtered through that muddy mess because thats what youll be thinking about Be conscious of your information diet Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance Eckhart Tolle Kaizen is as much a life philosophy and belief system as it is a strategy for success in changing or enhancing behavior Kaizen encourages us to be grateful for our health For our moments with family and friends For our next breath The world looks acts and responds to you differently when you have an orientation of gratitude for that which you already have When you appreciate optimize and leverage what you do have instead of ruminating over what you dont have you have the power to change your circumstances Inhale blessings Exhale gratitude Gratitude is the most effective path to find contentment If you need to wake up early as a parent you should feel grateful for having children to love If you need to clean or repair your home you should feel grateful for having a place to live If you have laundry chores to take care of you should feel grateful for having clothes to wear If you have dishes to clean you should feel grate ful for having food to eat If you feel tired in bed you should feel grateful for being alive in this beautiful world When famous American songwriter Warren Zevon was suffering from terminal cancer David Letterman asked him what wisdom he had drawn from his illness Zevons answer was pure kaizen Enjoy every sandwich The mind is everything What you think you become Gautama Buddha Our attitude determines our altitude Honest mistakes are perfectly acceptable As Charlie Munger would put it It seemed like a good idea at the time But failing to learn from our mistakes is not acceptable The difference between winners and losers is that win ners take ownership of their mistakes and as a result they learn from them and progress in life The key to learning from mistakes is to acknowledge them without excuses and to make the necessary changes to improve going forward If you cant admit your mistakes you wont grow When negative emotions come into play your mind is telling you that something is wrong on your current path and that you need to change direction Most people tend to ignore this warning You are not a product of your circumstances You are a product of what you think Happiness is all about the quality of thoughts you put in your head so ensure that you entertain the right ones Your thoughts influence your words and actions If you want to be a better person you need to discipline your mind When you begin to change yourself internally the world around you responds When your con sciousness or mental attitude shifts in the right direction remarkable things begin to happen Try to read or watch something productive or inspirational before going to sleep The mind continues to process the last information consumed before bedtime so you want to focus your attention on something constructive and helpful in making progress with your goals and ambitions This ensures that you finish strong every day The first thing you have to know is yourself People who are selfaware can step outside and observe their reactions Selfawareness allows you to experience life twicefirst with a detached point of view and second with the usual set of sensorial reactions embedded in thoughts and emotions Two versions of your experiences are living together in the shadows of your consciousness One version gives you a fulfilling life and the other version creates a life of regrets The version to which you give your attention will grow so choose wisely The underlying nature of the universe is insecure impermanent and ultimately fleeting Therefore dont seek security perma nence or prolongation Instead make peace with your place in the greater process The universe is in a constant state of regeneration To evolve the new replaces the old The same applies at the cellular level in the human body This is a lesson in letting go and detachment Our body is made up of approximately 37 trillion cells and each day our body and mind go through countless permutations and transfor mations Yet if we really pay attention we are bound to discover a single clear and authentic voice This is our true self and is the source of all meaning The Zen concept of calmness and deep concentration through meditation helps develop this ability I cant emphasize this enough learn to meditate When you train your mind to focus on something as simple as the breath it also gives you the discipline to focus on much bigger things and to tell the difference between whats really important and everything else Many of lifes failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up Thomas Edison Success lies on the same road as failure success is just a little farther down that road Keep plugging away you never know when your next action is going to hit it big Never give up after putting in hard work and effort because compounding bestows its benefits on you only after a long time after testing your patience and conviction to the fullest This is true not only in business and investing but also in life and relationships Most people develop interests in life but few make a real commitment The difference between interest and commitment is the will to not give up When you truly commit to something you have no alternative but success Getting interested will get you started but com mitment gets you to the finish line When youve prepared practiced worked hard and consistently put in the required effort sooner or later youll be presented with your moment of truth in life In that moment you will define who you are and who you are becoming Its not getting to the wall that counts its what you do after you hit it These are the defining moments of success and progress Growth and improvement live in those very momentswhen we either step forward or shrink back Instead of quitting every time you hit a mental or physical wall recognize that your competitors are facing the same challenges At this moment if you persist and keep going you will end up miles ahead This ittle longer results in a massive expansion of your limits This is compounding in action and because its power is backloaded you end up exponentially multiplying the results of that little extra in your efforts Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence Talent will not nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent Genius will not unrewarded genius is almost a proverb Education will not the world is full of educated derelicts Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent Calvin Coolidge Persistence is more important than knowledge You must persevere if you wish to succeed Knowledge and skill can be acquired through study and practice but nothing great comes to those who quit Rudyard Kipling described triumph and disaster as two imposters Treat them just the same and you will be fine come what may Every success is an opportunity to demonstrate humility Every setback is an opportunity to demonstrate resilience and build character Munger believes that adversity causes some people to transform themselves into a victim Whenever you think that some situation or some person is ruining your life its actually you who are ruining your life Its such a simple idea Feeling like a victim is a perfectly disastrous way to go through life If you just take the attitude that however bad it isin any way its always your fault and you just fix it as best you canthe socalled iron prescriptionI think that really works In his blog Joshua Kennon wrote about Mungers excruciatingly painful experiences with multiple adversities during his lifetime In 1953 Charlie was 29 years old when he and his wife divorced He had been married since he was 21 Charlie lost everything in the divorce his wife keeping the family home in South Pasadena Munger moved into dreadful conditions at the University Club and drove a terrible yellow Pontiac Shortly after the divorce Charlie learned that his son Teddy had leukemia In those days there was no health insurance you just paid everything out of pocket and the death rate was near 100 percent since there was nothing doctors could do Rick Guerin Charlies friend said Munger would go into the hospital hold his young son and then walk the streets of Pasadena crying One year after the diagnosis in 1955 Teddy Munger died Charlie was 31 years old divorced broke and burying his 9year old son Later in life he faced a horrific operation that left him blind in one eye with pain so terrible that he eventually had his eye removed Its fair bet that your present troubles pale in comparison Whatever it is get over it Start over He did it You can too My eyes went moist with emotion the first time I read this I immediately recalled a hardhitting moment from the preface of Kenneth Marshalls book Good Stocks Cheap Those who discover value investing tend to do so via one of two routes trauma or exposure Trauma alas is far more common Through reflection we learn that adversity is a natural part of life The purpose of reflecting on adversity is to understand that it is inevitable indiscriminate and arbitrary Bad things can and do happen to good people But we all have a hidden reserve of great strength inside that emerges when life puts us to the test You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have In the end we are defined by how we respond to failures and setbacks in our lives Indifference toward the things outside our con trol is the essence of the stoic disciplineand it is one of the most liberating realizations in life God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference Serenity Prayer All of us can find peace by cultivating indifference to things outside our control Acceptance is pragmatic We cannot change what has already happened but we can choose our reaction In his memoir Mans Search for Meaning Viktor Frankl wrote about this intrinsic virtue in all of us Everything can be taken from a man but one thing the last of the human freedomsto choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones own way emphasis added Montaigne the great French philosopher adopted these seventeen words as the motto of his life A man is not hurt so much by what happens as by his opinion of what happens And our opinion of what hap pens is entirely up to us Whatever happens in our lives our capacity to choose our response is eternal and cannot be taken from us From this capacity we can draw great strength Even in the confines of a concentration camp Frankl witnessed the inherent ability to choose ones own way in the prisoners who comforted others some even giving away their last piece of bread Our view of the world can be com pletely transformed when we embrace the belief that people are inherently good When we see the human side of everyone we learn to accept each other When we see the good in everyone we start to develop compassion and understanding and in so doing we begin treating others the way we would want to be treated with honor dignity re spect empathy and humanity When we learn to see the smallest of positive attributes in everyone we begin to respect and care for each person we encounter And that love friendship and trust in turn brings out the best virtue in each one of us When we treat people like we wanted to be treated everyone becomes happier and better and positivity spreads across our civilization This is compounding positive thoughts in action Our life is what our thoughts make it Marcus Aurelius When you change the way you look at things the things you look at change If you form a habit of looking for the good you will find it in the smallest of things around you and your mind will fill with happiness And happiness being one of the purest forms of strength is the key to success Once youve successfully achieved some goals you start believing you can achieve any other goal that is positive thoughts start compounding in your mind Thats why every success drives more successes These words of Charles Fillmore from his book Prosperity go right to the heart of what gives us our single greatest power as human beings You can do anything with the thoughts of your mind They are yours and under your control You can direct them coerce them hush them or crush them You can dissolve one thought and put another in its stead There is no other place in the universe where you are the absolute master The dominion given you as your divine right is over your own thoughts only When you fully appre hend this and begin to exercise your Godgiven dominion you begin to find the way to God the only door to God the door of mind and thought Compounding Good Health To keep the body in good health is a duty otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear Gautama Buddha Take care of your body Its the only place you have to live Jim Rohn Its not dying you should worry about its chronic disease What you can expect from not making the right health decisions isnt an early deathin fact thats the least of your worries Instead you should be concerned about years possibly decades of suffering from chronic disease in your old age As the pendulum has swung away from deaths caused by acute illness it has gravitated toward chronic illness Today a great number of working professionals die from heart problems strokes diabetes and lung disease Our cars Internet connec tions and lives have become faster but our physical activities have become slower The primary goal of exercise is to bring about muscular contraction Research has shown that sitting or plain inactivity charac terized by lack of muscular contraction is an independent risk factor in developing lifestyle diseases Sitting is the new smoking Chronic diseases and their effects can last years or even decades Thats why they are called chronicthey go on and on resulting in a slow but painful death The motivating factor for taking care of your health should not be how long you live but how you are going to live in your old age For example an American who reaches age sixty is expected to live on average at least another twenty years You need to be concerned with the quality of your life during that time You need to change your lifestyle early in life not to live longer but to live better in your seventies eighties and beyond You should take care of your body as if it needs to serve you for a hundred years What you do when youre young will catch up with you when you get old As James Clear aptly puts it The costs of your good habits are in the present The costs of your bad habits are in the future When you are young take care of your body get full medical checkups done periodically even when youre feeling well and keep yourself in good health Chronic diseases are largely preventable The World Health Organization makes it clear that chronic disease is primarily caused by common modifiable risk factors with the big three being unhealthy diet physical inac tivity and tobacco use The food you eat can be either the most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of poison When it comes to food always think nutrients not calories Vitamins minerals protein carbohydrates and fat all require adequate representation in your diet When it comes to fruits eat dont drink them Exposure to the air oxidizes the fruits nutrients and robs you of vitamins and minerals Vitamin and mineral supplements are no match for a healthy diet regular exercise and most important a positive attitude Stress is the biggest enemy of an efficient digestive system and the fatburning process because stress leads to secretion of cortisol in our body The function of cortisol is to lower our metabolic rate to prevent fat burning and to convert food to fat The body has learned this response as a means to cope with scarcity brought about by drought famine floods and other environmental hazards It also led to the evolution and survival of the human species from caveman mode to what we are today We can reduce cortisol production through a disciplined lifestyle regular exercise and positive thinking In fact studies have shown that exercise is much more effective than antidepressants as a form of therapy with you looking better as the only side effect Your energy levels are low only when you fail to reinvest into it the means of a stronger foundation Slowly deconstruct through workouts weight training and meditation and reconstruct through sleep water and nutrition the only receptacle your self will ever have Your body dictates the nature of your thoughts If you are in a good physical shape the thoughts popping into your head during a workout session wont be Damn thats hard I wanna give up but rather I can do more Yes I definitely can Thats why its critical to break out of the vicious cycle of being unfit Poor health triggers negative feelings thoughts and emotions which hinder your performance and prevent you from reaching your potential If you dont approach your limits which is a prerequisite for deliberate practice you wont improve With enough dedication and discipline what was once your stretch goal will become your warmup routine Those who have undergone major healthy changes realize how the state of their body correlates with the clarity of their mind and the stability of their emotions These in turn influence the quality of social interactions High performance often hides behind boring solutions and underused basic insights The fundamentals arent cool or sexy They just work One of the best health habits is to exercise for one hour three to four times every week and to avoid prolonged sedentary periods The second habit is to get eight hours of sleep every night The third is to drink more water and consume less sugar and junk food All three are obvious but they are often overlooked They have a more meaningful and immediate impact on the quality of your mental and physi cal health than 99 percent of all productivity tips Systems are better than goals because once you reach a goal eg to lose twenty pounds you tend to stop doing the very thing that made achieving that goal possible and you revert back to your old ways Avoid going on extreme diets When you crash diet you lose weight because your lean body weight the weight of everything except fat goes down while your fat body weight remains the same and sometimes actually increases The higher the amount of lean body weight you carry the greater your fatburning capacity Your total weight or overall body mass index measurements are not useful as an indicator of your health or fitness level your fat percentage is Ideally this percentage should be under 20 percent for men and under 25 percent for women Eat right and at the right time during the day The key to good health lies in three words moderation consistency and sustainabil ity Inculcate these as a part of your daily life and you will experience compounding good health in action Compounding Good Habits What you are is what you have been What youll be is what you do now Gautama Buddha The compound effect is always in action and it doesnt apply to money only Intellectual and physical aptitudes behave similarly A person who puts in continuous effort for ten years may achieve more in one week than someone who having started six months ago will achieve in an entire year Keeping a goal in mind and using it to direct our actions requires constant willpower In his seminal book on habit formation The Power of Habit Charles Duhigg writes Willpower isnt just a skill Its a muscle like the muscles in your arms or legs and it gets tired as it works harder so theres less power left over for other things During times when other parts of our lives deplete our supply of willpower we may end up neglecting our goals Goals rely on extrinsic motivation But habits once formed operate automatically Habits put our brains on autopilot Once we develop a habit our brains actually transform to make a required behavior easier to complete By switching our focus from achieving spe cific goals to creating positive longterm habits we can make continuous improvement a way of life This is evident from the documented habits of many successful people For example Buffett and Munger have a habit of reading for hours every day According to Duhiggs research habits make up 40 percent of our waking hours These actions add up and make us who we are And the effects of these actions compound Every single manifestation of our thoughts and emotions is a direct consequence of a succession of habits that have been com pounding through the years As the saying goes First we make our habits then our habits make us When you suddenly drop or change a bad habit it can feel excruciating or at least quite uncomfortable for a short while But just as the body adjusts to a changing environment through a process called homeostasis we have a similar homeostatic ability to adjust to unfa miliar behavior We usually can regulate ourselves physiologically and psychologically adjusting to the new circumstances quite quickly For some of your longstanding and deeprooted habits it may be more effective to take small steps to ease into unwinding them You may have spent decades repeating cementing and fortifying those habits so it is good to give yourself some time to unravel them one step at atime Whenever youre having trouble sticking to a new habit try a smaller version until it becomes automatic Do less than youre capable of but do it consistently That is the key to compounding You have to build a program that you can do for decades not weeks or months Its far easier and requires a lot less energy to take off once and maintain a regular speed even ifit is slower than everyone else all along the way Start with the easiest things so you gain momentum and confidence to tackle the more difficult things later Pursue small incremental victories A small concrete win creates momentum and affirms our faith in our further success Confidence is like a muscle The more you use it the stronger it gets The best way to change is by doing mental exercises Enlist the help of Duhiggs threestep habit loop to connect the rewards to the actions rewiring your brain to love learning and beneficial change The first step is a cue some trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use according to Duhigg Step two is the routine which can be physical or mental or emotional Finally there is the reward which helps your brain figure out whether the particular loop in question is worth remembering for the future This anticipation and craving is the key to operant conditioning Repetition reinforces this loop until over time it becomes auto matic The best way to deal with a habit is to respect the habit loop Duhigg says To change a habit you must keep the old cue and deliver the old reward but insert a new routine We can work to change the stimulus that releases dopamine in our brain Our brain is built to seek positive selfimage updates We can work on finetuning the routine of what gives us the good feeling in our narrative We can work to get the reward of feeling good about ourselves from being a genuine credit giver a candid mistake admitter an honest finder of mistakes even in good outcomes and a keen learner Habits form the foundation of productivity The more you do automatically the more you are subsequently freed to do This effect compounds Focus on your environment virtual and physical because it nudges your subconscious and affects your habits It is more effective to design an environment in which you dont need willpower than to rely on willpower to conquer your surroundings Set up an environment that plays to your strengths and minimizes your weaknesses Remember acknowledging your weaknesses is not the same as surrendering to them Acknowledgement is the first positive step toward overcoming weaknesses We likely have good reasons for our bad habits Our experiences to date have set us in stone to a certain extent and the older we are the more likely that is to be true Buffett often says The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken2 We all are slaves of habits Once a habit becomes ingrained it can last for life so inculcate good habits Most bad habits creep in slowly Be care ful of making small compromises The adverse although subtle effect of such actions compound over time A single poor habit which doesnt look like much in the moment ultimately can land you miles off course from the direction of your goals and the life you desire The real question isnt Who am I The real question is Who am I becoming We are constantly evolving but the person you will be in the next five to ten years is feeding on the habits and decisions you make today Our decisions determine our trajectory but our habits determine how far we travel along that path To paraphrase James Clear Our outcomes are a lagging measure of our habits Our net worth is a lagging measure of our financial habits Our knowledge is a lagging mea sure of our learning habits Our health is a lagging measure of our eating habits Our energy is a lagging measure of our sleep habits Our fitness is a lagging measure of our exercise habits We get what we repeat so our current trajectory matters more than our current results Success is earnedone day at a time The seeds of greatness are planted in the daily grind In his book Good to Great Jim Collins explains that in the transition from good to great the flywheel starts slowly and through consistent small actions momentum builds Most people end up in this cycle hard hard hard hurt Id rather go slow slow slow never stop Slow but consistent gains add up much faster than you can imagine Small positive changes add up to massive improvements over time figure 321 If we can get 5 percent better every year then we will be about twice as good in less than fifteen years In less than thirty years our growth will be 4x This is how people with average intellect surpass far more intelligent people It is also why Peter Kaufman says The most powerful force that could be potentially harnessed is dogged incremental constant progress over a very long time frame2 SA DN fer UKe WUGH Ae te ime BOT Thd WhS Miowe Wi golemMenT Figure 321 This is compounding good habits in action Source Behavior Gap Compounded efforts in the right direction within the various important areas of our lives lead to increasingly higher lows and lower volatility Little things can quickly add up Do not underestimate what you can achieve in the long term For example if you dont trust your social skills start going out once a week and meet one new individual After two years that adds up to more than one hundred new connections Social selfconfidence is built on habits Time is the greatest ally of compounding and confers exponential powers upon those who think and act long term This is because nis the only element in the compound interest equation that exists in the exponent and is the numeric that the entire expression is raised to the power of Maintain a steadfast consistency in your efforts over a long period of time and you will surpass all expectations Whether at the scale of the universe civilization or individual lives time is a translating machine constantly processing the input of efforts An overnight success is the result of many compounded efforts over a long period of time that lacked the key to connect it all together No magic bullet exists for success in lifeonly compounding efforts in the right direction and some good luck In my view Buffetts greatness does not stem from his superlative investment track record or even his highly generous philan thropic contributions His greatest gift to humanity is a welldocumented life in which he has led by example in demonstrating to all of us how integrity honesty ethics hard work independent thinking following ones passion and embracing lifelong learning can lead to im mense success These are great habits and virtues to adopt When you improve a little each day eventually big things occur When you improve conditioning a little each day eventually you have a big improvement in conditioning Not tomorrow not the next day but eventually a big gain is made Dont look for the big quick improvement Seek the small improvement one day at a time Thats the only way it happensand when it happens it lasts John Wooden Compounding Wealth Good investing isnt necessarily about earning the highest returns because the highest returns tend to be oneoff hits that kill your confi dence when they end Its about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with for a long period of time emphasis added Thats when compounding runs wild Morgan Housel The first thing to realize is that it takes a long time I started when I was eleven Accumulating money is a little like having a snowball going downhill its important to have a very long hill Ive had a fiftysixyear hill Its important to work in sticky snow and you need a little snowball to start with which I got from delivering the Post actually Its better if youre not in too much of a hurry and keep doing sound things emphasis added Warren Buffett Buffett has always considered the longterm game to be the best game This circles back to his love for compound interest which was so strong that when his wife Susie wanted to give to charity years ago Buffett insisted on waiting so that eventually the giveaway could be far greater Buffett is a man who thinks really long termin tenyear or even twentyyear increments He doesnt waste a dollar today because he knows how compound interest will make that dollar worth more in the future A lot more The human mind is not naturally wired to think in exponential terms and thus fails to intuitively appreciate the incredible power of compounding The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function Al Bartlett According to the rule of seventytwo we double our capital every three years by compounding at 26 percent ten times in ten years and one hundred times in twenty years The day I understood the dynamics of reinvested profit and compound interest I immediately knew that I was going to become wealthy in my lifetime Ijust needed to get started I began looking forward to every day as a new oppor tunity to learn and improve The goals of investment should be happiness joy growth intellectual satisfaction and eventually peace and serenity Wealth and financial prosperity are natural byproducts of lifelong learning You will often notice a common trait among many value investors the day we finally realize the power of compound interest is a transformational moment for us and we embrace frugality and simple living as a way of life Frugality isnt about avoiding spending money its about spending money only on things that add value to your life The key to wealth creation in investing is time and the op portunity costs of not inculcating a good saving habit early in life can be huge Let us look at an example of two individuals who make all the same choices except onetheir use of time Paul is eighteen years old He gets an afterschool job and opens a Roth IRA He saves 5000 per year in it and continues doing this until he turns seventy years old He is a knownothing investor invests in cheap lowcost index funds dollarcost averages reinvests his dividends and earns the same nominal return the market has for the past century around 10 percent As a result he ends up with alittle more than 7 million in wealth Peter is also eighteen years old He also gets an afterschool job but he doesnt save anything as he wants to engage in instant grat ification and conspicuous consumption during his fun years He waits until he is thirty years old at which point he opens a retirement account saves 5000 per year in it and then does all the same things as Paul Peter is only 60000 in total contributions behind Paul and he still has forty years to go before he turns seventy so he figures it isnt too bad When he reaches retirement though he has only 22 million Amere 60000 difference between Paul and Peter in cumulative investment turned into a 48 million difference in net worth This example shows as John Bogle would call it the relentless rules of humble arithmetic Time is power in investing This is best illustrated by the timeless tale of Benjamin Franklins experiment with compound interest which was driven by the strong optimism he had for his newly formed country at the time When Franklin died in 1790 he left a gift of 5000 to each of his two favorite cities Boston and Philadelphia He stipulated that the money was to be invested and could be paid out at two specific dates the first 100 years and the second 200 years after the date of the gift After 100 years each city was allowed to withdraw 500000 for public works projects After 200 years in 1991 they received the balancewhich had compounded to approximately 20 million for each city Franklins example teaches all of us ina dramatic way the power of compounding As Franklin himself liked to describe the benefits of compounding Money makes money And the money that money makes makes money emphasis added2 If you remain unconvinced about the allpowerful role of time in compounding wealth consider this If Warren Buffett had begun investing at age thirty he would be worth only about 2 billion today Instead he started in third grade accumulated 1 million by the age of thirty and has around 81 billion todayan extra 79 billion And more than 99 percent of Buffetts net worth was created after his fiftieth birthday The key takeaway is this the power of compounding is backloaded Rule number 1 Never lose money Rule number 2 Live a long and healthy life Here is the mathematical equation for successfully compounding wealth Add to your savings every month Eliminate biases greed and wasteful expenses x Multiply your time horizon Divide across asset classes as appropriate for your stage in life and your personal circumstances Achieve the exponential power of compounding The wasteful expenses in this equation include excessive taxes on capital gains because of frequent churning and frictional costs including brokerage commissions and statutory charges Taxpaying investors will realize a far far greater sum from a single investment that compounds internally at a given rate than from a succession of investments compounding at the same rate Warren Buffett In his 1989 letter Buffett illustrated the importance of not churning ones portfolio too frequently Imagine that Berkshire had only 1 which we put in a security that doubled by yearend and was then sold Imagine further that we used the aftertax proceeds to repeat this process in each of the next 19 years scoring a double each time At the end of the 20 years the 34 percent capital gains tax that we would have paid on the profits from each sale would have delivered about 13000 to the government and we would be left with about 25250 Not bad If however we made a single fantastic investment that itself dou bled 20 times during the 20 years our dollar would grow to 1048576 Were we then to cash out we would pay a 34 percent tax of roughly 356500 and be left with about 692000 The sole reason for this staggering difference in results would be the timing of tax payments Interestingly the government would gain from Scenario 2 in exactly the same 271 ratio as wetaking in taxes of 356500 vs 13000though admittedly it would have to wait for its money2 In both cases the investment doubles annually but in the end we have a staggering twentyseven times difference No wonder Munger says The first rule of compounding Never interrupt it unnecessarily4 The way to wealth is to buy right and hold on By doing so an investor minimizes paperwork transaction costs and capital gains taxes To reap genuine riches one needs to invest in longterm winners and hold on for compounded taxfree growth No more effective tax haven exists than unrealized appreciation in a longlived soundly growing company Compounding combined with patience is an incredible force over time In addition to the greater tax outgo be mindful of the huge impact that tiny frictional costs can have on your net worth in the long run A small leak can sink a great ship In the course of our daily lives we treat a 2 percent charge as a small amount In the world of investing however 2 percent is a huge deal Ithas the potential to change your life completely A tiny difference in incremental returns over a long period of time results in a mas sive difference in accumulated wealth The effects of compounding are too small to be noticed until they are too large to be ignored To illustrate the impact a tiny 2 percent of savings in frictional costs can make in the long run lets assume that you invest 30000 today in three fixed income instruments yielding 7 percent 9 percent and 11 percent respectively Figure 322 shows what this invest ment will look like after forty years 7 returns 3 9 returns 11 returns 2 20 million 1 09 million 04 million 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Years FIGURE 322 The 2 percent difference Nowit is the turn of equitiesthe greatest longterm wealthcreating asset class Figure 323 shows what happens if you invest the same sum of money in a portfolio of highquality stocks with an average annual earnings growth of 15 percent and a 2 percent dividend for a total of 17 percent return 7 returns 9 returns 11 returns 20 17 return 15 capital growth 2 dividend 160 million 15 2 10 vr 30000 initial 5 investment 20 million _ 09 million i li o 04 million 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Years Figure 323 This is compounding wealth in action Instead of treating dividends as free money and engaging in mental accounting investors should resist instant gratification and always immediately reinvest their dividends Reinvesting your dividends through a dividend reinvestment plan DRIP isa great way to take maximum advantage of the power of longterm compounding A DRIP automatically uses your dividends to buy more shares of the holdings in your portfolio You can enroll all your stocks in a DRIP through your brokerage firm They do not charge commissions or have minimum investment requirements and you gain the added benefit of dollarcost averaging After enough years go by the benefits accrue in the form of higher dividends that may be a multiple of the original investment This is the power of compound interest In addition to earning returns on the money you invest you also earn returns on those re turns over time This compound growth is what causes your wealth to snowball over time When we reinvest dividends we enjoy the power of double compounding or compound interest on steroids This shows you the incredible wealthcreation potential of equities in the long term And our example assumed that you did not make even a single additional contribution throughout your earning years Just imagine how your compounding engine will skyrocket once you make regular contributions too The final figure then becomes truly astonishing Compounding Knowledge When we bought Sees Candy we didnt know the power of a good brand Over time we just discovered that we could raise prices 10 percent ayear and no one cared Learning that changed Berkshire It was really important You have to be a lifelong learner to appreciate this stuff We think of it as a moral duty Increasing rationality and improving as much as you can no matter your age or experience is a moral duty femphasis added Charlie Munger Buffett articulated his zeal for constant learning in his 1991 lecture at the University of Notre Dame Iread all kinds of business publications I read a lot of industry publications ll grab whatever comes in the morning American Banker comes every day so Ill read that Ill read the Wall Street Journal Obviously Ill read Editor and Publisher Ill read Broadcast ing Vl read Property Casualty Review Ill read Jeffrey Meyers Beverage Digest ll read everything And I own 100 shares of almost every stock I can think of just so I know Ill get all the reports And I carry around prospectuses and proxy material25 Ina similar vein during the 2001 Berkshire annual meeting Buffett remarked When I started I went through the pages of the manuals page by page I mean I probably went through 20000 pages in the Moodys industrial transportation banks and finance manu als And I did it twice And I actually you know looked at every business I didnt look very hard at some1 Munger sees his knowledge accumulation as an acquired rather than natural genius And he gives all the credit to studying Nei ther Warren nor I is smart enough to make the decisions with no time to think We make actual decisions very rapidly but thats because weve spent so much time preparing ourselves by quietly sitting and reading and thinking 2 One of my favorite Buffett stories on the virtues of building up ones mental database over time comes from a 1993 interview of Buffett with George Goodman popularly known by the pen name of Adam Smith Adam Smith If a younger Warren Buffett were coming into the investment field today what areas would you tell him to point him self in Warren Buffett Well if he were doingif he were coming in and working with small sums of capital Id tell him to do exactly what Idid fortyodd years ago which is to learn about every company in the United States that has publicly traded securities and that bank of knowledge will do him or her terrific good over time Smith But theres 27000 public companies Buffett Well start with the As emphasis added18 Buffett acquired many of his mental models by reading hundreds of annual reports every year and by running business operations for decades He applied these models to analyzing more businesses and used the accumulated knowledge to make further investments In his 1997 speech at the California Institute of Technology Buffett highlighted this very point Owning Sees Candies which we bought in 1972 really taught me a lot about the value of brands and what could be done with them so I understood CocaCola better when it came along in 1988 than if I had never been in Sees Weve got a profit of close to 10 billion dollars in Coke Now a significant part of that is attributable to the fact that we bought Sees Candy for 25 million dollars in 1972 The nice thing about investments is that knowledge accumulates on you emphasis added and if you understand a business or industry once you are going to understand it for the next fifty years2 Indeed great benefits accrue from gradually building up a large mental database of businesses and industries because knowledge builds on previous foundations and grows over time just like compound interest And this in turn leads to pattern recognition Learning about the concept of local economies of scale from Bruce Greenwalds book Competition Demystified helped me identify Hester Biosciences Learning about the capital cycle theory from Edward Chancellors book Capital Returns helped me identify HEG Learn ing about the banking industry from Tamal Bandyopadhyays book on HDFC Bank helped me identify Bandhan Bank AU Small Finance Bank and Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Learning about the importance of project execution capabilities from Dilip Buildcon helped me identify PSP Projects Learning about the housing finance industry from Can Fin Homes helped me identify Aavas Financiers Learning about the microfinance industry from Bharat Financial helped me identify CreditAccess Grameen This is compounding knowledge in action When we compound knowledge we advance not only ourselves but also the world at large It takes a small individual action to kick start a learning revolution This is what Confucius wrote in Higher Education When things are investigated knowledge is extended When knowledge is extended the will becomes sincere When the will is sincere the heart is set right When the heart is right the personal life is cultivated When personal lives are cultivated families become harmonious When families are harmonious government becomes orderly And when government is orderly there will be peace in the world2 And this is what Li Lu told the students at the Guanghua School of Management in China in October 2015 When two people exchange knowledge they learn more than just what the other is thinking their meeting will also create the sparks of new ideas The sharing of knowledge requires no exchange like trading corn for milk But when you combine knowledge you begin to see growth happen in large increments thanks to the benefits of compounding Only when each exchange can produce such large in cremental benefits will society be able to speedily create wealth This kind of continuous interpersonal exchange multiplied billions of times created the modern free market economy And this is Civilization 30 Continuous sustainable economic growth is only possible with this kind of exchange This kind of economic system is the only way to fully release mankinds energy and true motivations This system is probably the greatest innovation in the history of mankind emphasis added Confucius and Li Lu make us aware of our impact on the world when we engage in constant learning But in my view compounding knowledge is so powerful that its impact is not limited to our world The reverberations are felt across the entire universe Ray Dalio explains this in his book Principles It isa reality that each one of us is only one of about seven billion of our species alive today and that our species is only one of about ten million species on our planet Earth is just one of about 100 billion planets in our galaxy which is just one of about two trillion galaxies in the universe And our lifetimes are only about 13000 of humanitys existence which itself is only 120000 of the Earths existence In other words we are unbelievably tiny and shortlived and no matter what we accomplish our impact will be insignificant At the same time we instinctually want to matter and to evolve and we can matter a tiny bitand its all those tiny bits that add up to drive the evolution of the universe emphasis added22 Profound Compounding Goodwill Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier Mother Teresa In March 2015 Mohnish Pabrai and Guy Spier gave a talk at the Stanford Graduate School of Business The core theme of the talk was the concept of giving without expecting anything in return of being a giver not a taker Guy talked about the extraordinary power of com pounding goodwill when we are a giver In the initial years we wont see much happening to our goodwill account But as years progress goodwill snowballs and starts to grow exponentially figure 324 Buffetts goodwill account is at its peak and is poised to grow at a scintil lating pace well beyond his lifetime Goodwill over time 500 Warren Buffetts Give without expecting goddwillis here in return 150 If you keep giving without expecting anything S 100 in return your goodwill 3 account snowballs and 9 grows exponentially 50 Nothing much happens during initial years 0 4 8 12 16 20 Time in years FIGURE 324 Goodwill

you actually do love you The more you give love away the more you get Warren Buffett Giving makes us richer than getting The selfless act of helping others unconditionally is such a great virtue that I would like to illustrate it with an example from my life that is close to my heart During my initial years as an investor when I was really struggling I looked to Ian Cassel of MicroCapClub for constant inspiration because he regularly posted motivational content on his blog As a mark of my gratitude for his positive influence I began sharing content that I thought would be helpful for him through LinkedIn As is always the case with compounding for a long time nothing seemed to happen And then this happened figure 325 fo3 lan Cassel Its great to finally see Gautam_Baid on twitter Hes been sending me great information articles for a long time 1 tan Cassel It was great to finally talk to Baid today An amazing story of perseverance and he is only getting started ex Gre done with re

yourself in a rut and your only relationships represent who you used to be not where you want to go Ian Cassel Making connections by email or phone is nothing like meeting in person You need to really make a genuine effort to create strong bonds with people who are on the same path as you If you do this with utmost sincerity your network of compounded relationships will open many unexpected joyful doors for you in the future Just take that first small step You will be mighty surprised at how far you end up reaching with regard to building your relationships Never underestimate the power of a heartfelt handwritten note It can potentially open the door for serendipity to enter your life Be humble with everyone you meet irrespective of who they are and be fully present and genuine In addition to this give due credit generously to those who deserve it and connect people who would benefit from knowing each other The takeaway from connecting the philosophies described in this chapter is to think and act long termreally long term The other key insights are as follows Ittakes along time to create anything that is valuable Work hard every day even without seeing any results in the short term Keep doing it consistently for a long time without giving up Enjoy the process and live life according to the inner scorecard Do not compare yourself to others Instead always endeavor to become a better version of yourself compared to what you were the previous day Anybody who is doing all of these things is most likely going to succeed in his or her pursuit in life This is exactly what Buffett meant when he said Games are won by players who focus on the field not the ones looking at the scoreboard23 Mahatma Gandhi described compounding in all its glory when he said these words Your beliefs become your thoughts Your thoughts become your words Your words become your actions Your actions become your habits Your habits become your values Your values become your destiny It all starts with one small belief one small thought one small word one small action one small habit one small value And that makes one big destiny Ahappy healthy and successful life follows the same route One small step at a time Take care and keep learning
