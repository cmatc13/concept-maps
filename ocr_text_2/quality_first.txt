people tenets does the business have great people behind it background tthe end of the day people drive profits not numbers understanding the motivations of people behind a business is a significant part of understanding the long term drive of the company it all comes down to doing business with people you trust trust in management is paramount in smaller companies but still very important when investing in large caps i ve learned over time that great management teams deliver positive surprises and bad ones negative surprises and few high quality companies have weak management conversely poor businesses typically have the effect of repelling both good management and good owners when it comes to people the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour accordingly you should judge management by what they do not what they say by not rushing into investment decisions and by taking the time to understand a management team you can reduce your risk of misjudging them most errors in assessing managers are made when you see only what you want to see and ignore flaws or warning signs for example al ways avoid ceos who hire compensation advisors with expertise in what can be accomplished legally to their benefit and appoint friends as patsy directors who will permit the abuse of outside shareholders two of the biggest mistakes you can make as an investor are to blindly trust management statements and to ignore signs of poor corporate governance standards you should take seriously even the slightest doubt over these key areas that s why we have incorporated the qual ity of the board into the assessment of a management team directors hold the keys to arguably the two biggest controllable factors ina business compensation and capital allocation be the framework the people rating is based on quantitative scores in seven sub categories business passion execution capability capital allocation investor communication executive compensation ownership strength and board leadership all of these sub categories are assessed on five quantitative and qualitative checks each is allocated one point if the question can be answered positively the total number of these points makes up each sub category s score on a scale that ranges from 0 to 5 rounded to the nearest whole number if unsure about a question or disclosure is inadequate the check fails by default this is consistent with the best ideas often being the simplest each sub category also includes a sixth complementary check these negative questions provide additional information to assist with investment decision making but have no impact on the scoring model esg analysis to fully understand companies long term prospects the checklist also covers esg issues analysing these factors is central to measuring the sustainability and ethical impact of an investment in any company we address the e environmental and s social factors in social respon ity analysis however in my view the g in esg should come first the governance factor shapes companies approaches to e and as well as the way that they prioritise development in a world of constant change in other words a company s corporate governance is important to in vestors since it reveals business integrity and direction to examine governance use the checklists for board leadership ownership strength executive compensation and capital allocation as these are all crucial components of good corporate governance the average score for these four supporting sub categories provides a good proxy for governance quality and can help measure the extent to which a board is likely to promote the interests of all shareholders after all companies are run by human beings poorly structured incentives weak oversight and limited checks on power are very likely to lead to poor decision making at best and something far less pleasant at worst business passion analysis is the ceo passionate about the business opportunity versely if you can identify them you should avoid the tourist manager who is just in it for the glory passing through on the way t he hallmark of all truly great business leaders and entrepreneurs is that the business is their life and career not just a job con to something bigger when warren buffett was once asked how he determines which managers to partner with he said the biggest question i ask myself is do they love the money or do they love the business and passion is the number one thing i look for in a manager often it s the leadership s vision and passion that ignites the business opportunity both qualities that must be combined with tenacity which is a necessary ingredient for success because rewards are often far off in the future that s why a large compensation package will never be as powerful as internal motivation like following our interests and end up doing what we love for work in the end most companies end up making money from something other than their original idea the idea is nothing whereas passion and tenacity are everything there has to be an energising force business biographies tend to show precisely this how passionate people who live and breathe their business created something out of nothing that s why the ultimate question is is this person going to dedicate his or her life to make something extraordinary happen companies like alibaba amazon google ikea spotify and many others have or had founders who focus relentlessly on pleasing their customers and thinking about strategies that will impact their companies values 10 or 20 years down the road such founders have not just skin in the game but heart and soul in the game be business passion checklist 1 does the ceo have a visionary attitude towards the business s opportunities 2 does the ceo think independently and exhibit original ideas 3 does the ceo have strong market insight 4 has the ceo stayed in the same industry for more than a decade 5 does the ceo show genuine excitement for their products 6 does the ceo serve on a significant number of outside boards 1 does the ceo have a visionary attitude towards the business s opportunities why does it matter great management can envision a great future and articulate a cohesive and logical strategy to get there such ceos are rational long term thinkers who look way ahead and are determined to drive things forward with a clear vision for the company they typically invest for the longer term by focusing on what is best for the customer and not just short term profits these ceos act like long term owners of a business not like caretakers in other words long term here means focusing on customer needs over time both what will change in them and what will not long term thinking and adaptability are two sides of the same coin ceos who spend significantly more of their time thinking about the long term and have long term plans generally excel at adapting to change this focus helps because it makes ceos more likely to pick up on early signals and make strategic moves to take advantage of it as evolutionary biologist charles darwin said it is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change leaders who can t see it probably won t find it ceos who lack vision cannot inspire teams motivate performance or create sustainable value poor vision tunnel vision vision thatiisficke or anon existent vision will cause leaders to fal how to assess it try to assess if the ceo has a vision that they can translate into a strategy to make the company a long term winner not just a good story this kind of ceo is typically progressive and research minded and can articulate a worldview beyond company operations one that factors in global social environmental and economic issues there should be a vision based on analysis of future industry trends that will necessitate course corrections from time to time as the competitive landscape change aceo who exhibits a visionary attitude is typically convincing about their vision and how to achieve their objectives always ask the ceo how he or she measures success in the company by what means where they want to be in the next five to 10 years and how they will get there what does the ceo consider to be the most important long term challenge facing the company what initiatives are being taken today to grow the business further and increase shareholder value be very cautious if the ceo struggles to articulate a vision of where he or she sees the company in the next five to 10 years likewise shun ceos with an improbable weak long term vision for the future without a strong vision a company is wandering directionless if the ceo is a rational long term thinker with a clear vision for the company the stock is scored one point 2 does the ceo think independently and exhibit original ideas why does it matter not thinking independently leads to mediocrity building a great company is about figuring out what competitors have missed and find inga solution in other words a good company will change in line with competitors but a great company will lead the way as it moves past best practices in search of next practices aceo who has demonstrated the ability to think independently has a sound plan for the business a plan that is not about copying the past success of competitors but rather about meeting the customers needs and wants or how the company could become a better version of itself how to assess it look for ceos who question the status quo and engage with bold new ideas and initiatives this approach involves finding new pockets of value in the industry and being creative over time such ceos typically don t benchmark against their competitors but rather march to their own rules by focusing on what customers really want and need and bringing a better product to market a good example of creativity could be a strategy that adapts a proven business model or idea from another market for their own market these ceos are often founders and corporate outsiders who bring fresh approaches and perspectives thanks to not being weighed down by the traditional industry rules in tum this should lead them to maintain some distance from conventional wisdom where companies imitate one another in destructive group thinking by assuming competitors know something they don t this is the consistency and com mitment bias charlie munger talked about in his great speech the psychology of human misjudgement always be very cautious towards ceos who are unable to see past the current paradigm and the way things have always been done this type of leader is typically obsessed with what others are doing and is likely to seek to replicate the success of a competitor s breakthrough products or profitable business lines this is the surest path to mediocrity if the ceo challenges conventional practices and remains unaffected by what competitors are doing the stock is scored one point 3 does the ceo have a strong market insight why does it matter ceos need to have deep market awareness and a strong sense of future market needs to ensure long term growth with poor market per ception the result is usually valueless research and development ask the ceos of these companies detailed questions about what is going on in a certain market or region and they know the answers this is critical for developing the company s strategy to put more distance between it and the competition how to assess it the ceo should be able to clearly explain the state of the industry and how they are taking advantage of current trends what they are doing uniquely why this approach will succeed and show some numbers to back up their claims the details in their answer to the following questions will make it clear whether the ceo has a solid understanding of their customer base market and competition what trends are shaping your industry what causes companies in your industry to fail what does your company do that your competitors can t and how do you convert that into an estimate of future cash flows be wary if the ceo denies that the company has competition or insists that it does not take its competitors seriously when a ceo claims their company to have no competition it s typically because he or she is clueless about their target market or there isn t a need for their product even if it is substitutes or alternatives or other things competing for wallet share or a customer s time every company has some competition if the ceo has deep industry knowledge and a solid understanding of their market the stock is scored one point 4 has the ceo stayed in the same industry for more than a decade why does it matter a manager who has remained in the same industry for an uncommonly long period of time is likely to pursue his or her passion and is likely to have developed talent a major part of success can be boiled down to doing one thing consistently for an uncommonly long period of time a beneficial side effect of this is that this type of manager typically develops deep industry knowledge and expertise in building the necessary technology or service and has a vast personal talent network to recruit from ideally they are the company founder or a long tenured manager who has spent their whole career at the company however industry veterans often get accustomed to a certain way of doing things or thinking about them and struggles to approach prob lems from a different perspective to think independently and exhibit original ideas this is the check 2 above how to assess it constructing a chronology of the ceo s career will help to understand their background how they rose to lead the business if the ceo has remained in the same industry for more than a decade the stock is scored one point 5 does the ceo show genuine excitement for their products why does it matter the best managers are product enthusiasts who bring products to market that they would personally buy but cannot find elsewhere such managers are passionate about their job and work towards their organizational goals with intensity and genuine excitement they are de termined to succeed and typically have a strong focus on market leadership by being the first to offer a product or offering the best one creating something new improved and more beneficial reflects their dissatisfaction with the status quo instead they are focused on leading change and innovation to keep their organizations fresh dynamic and growing the bottom line is if they don t love and believe in what they are building they are likely to give up at some point along the way due to the scepticism and setbacks that every business will inevitably face how to assess it listen to interviews with management or better yet interview them yourself to assess whether a ceo is obsessed with their business and building a great product by focus on customer needs does he or she seem enthusiastic about the company and obviously proud of it however beware technology first managers as they often develop the product they themselves want and avoid engaging with customers look for signs of deep conviction about the problem they are trying to solve for customers they understand what customers want and ultimately have personal experience with this problem other common traits are a strong belief in problem solving and implementing so lutions always striving to move faster and be better as well as exceptional work ethics and obsessive attention to detail they are typically not satisfied with simply having a successful company in the end they have an unquenchable desire to build a business that will break records with huge amounts of competitive spirit they just love what they do notice the fairly high number of people on the forbes richest list who were never in it for the money likewise these people tend not to be high profile individuals as their ambition is to grow their companies to greatness not themselves they typically put the company s well being before their own convenience moreover they are generally more motivated by the day to day process than the end game as this type of person almost never starts a fyusiness with the intention of selling it they typically don t have an exit strategy ifit s a pre revenue company look for founders and early employees with a track record of success sacrificing an enormous opportunity cost to pursue this start up because they believe in it think about how much the team would earn if each put out their cvs tomorrow if the ceo is a product enthusiast with great optimism for solutions the stock is scored one point 6 does the ceo serve on a significant number of outside boards why does it matter the ceo s role is a position of great responsibility and time demands sitting on multiple outside boards may threaten his or her ability to attend to the business of their primary employer how to assess it in this question you consider the total number of public board seats held by the ceo including the company all subsidiaries with their own publicly traded stock are counted as individual boards excessive board memberships more than two outside boards three in total raises concerns of governance risk after all managers who are truly passionate about their business have less time for other activities such as sitting on the board of other public companies if the ceo serves on more than two outside boards three in total this check is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for people and is included as additional information to assist with investment decision making execution capability analysis does management appear to have strong execution capabilities key characteristic of strong leadership is the ability to execute well at its core execution simply means getting things done effective execution is a key determinant of business success or failure the core of executing a company s strategy is in three processes the people process the strategy process and the operations process in other words the quality of execution depends a lot on quality of strategy and managers ability to link operations to strategic goals and human capacity you will take less risk partnering with managers who have a proven track record of running a business because you can give more weight to their history the challenge with evaluating performance is that it often takes years to see how things play out but there are a number of tell tale signs that indicate ability to execute on opportunities however do not confuse execution with passion for product and cus tomers or market insight execution capability checklist 1 does management have complementary skills and relevant sector experience 2 have the senior team and ceo been together for more than five years 3 is there a sound strategy for long term growth 4 does management tend to deliver on promises on time and according to plan 5 has the ceo done it successfully before 6 does the ceo face personal challenges that might cloud his or her judgement 1 does management have complementary skills and relevant sector experience why does it matter it all comes down to whether the senior management team has complementary skills and a long track record of relevant sector experi ence if they do the odds are in your favour particularly if there is a long learning curve in the sector how to assess it to better understand the likelihood for success evaluate the quality of each executive and what skills they bring to the team make sure management represents a diverse skillset and depth of industrial experience within the sector ideally with international companies here are some things to look out for when checking up on the management team s professional backgrounds a bios that contain no specific roles or company names for their executives at least for the past 10 years typically don t have them for a reason and it s unlikely to be positive b discrepancies between executive bios on the company s website and those you find for the same people elsewhere c bios that contain no educational references d company websites that have no management director bios e ceos and cfos who have never held these positions before if the senior management team has complementary skills and average experience of at least five years in the sector the stock is scored one point 2 have the senior team and ceo been together for more than five years why does it matter a good indicator of a strong management is how long the ceo and the senior management have been serving the company together long tenure is a great signal of intrinsic motivation and confidence in the business as well as a good sign that the management has the ability to work as a team ultimately you want to understand how they ve performed in both difficult and favourable business environments as this provides a means of measuring their credibility how to assess it check whether top managers median tenure at the company is over five years ideally most have been promoted from within accumulat ing experience in multiple positions and refining their understanding of the customer base increased turnover at the top can be a sign of trouble if top managers are heading for the door it s not a sign of a management team with a history of success together it s rather an indication of a business that s deteriorating or that the company is not able to retain high qual ity talent also a ceo who keeps forcing out immediate subordinates is likely spending too much time on internal power struggles and not enough on running the business this makes it difficult or impossible for the company to build momentum and move fast finally it helps a lot to do some background work with people the management team have worked with in the past these should be people who know them well have seen them in leadership positions and can fairly evaluate if this is a strong team that will drive the busi ness forward if the median tenure of the company s top managers is more than five years the stock is scored one point 3 is there a sound strategy for long term growth why does it matter a good management should set out goals and strategies for the company a collection of intentional decisions that will provide a context for all decision making accordingly the quality of a management s execution depends a lot on the quality of their strategy a well devel oped simple strategy for long term growth is probably the most important pillar of any business management should clearly state its long term plan for how the company is supposed to grow and protect the business against competi tion the latter is one of the most important tasks for any ceo to widen the moat of the business at the same time beware leaders who are satisfied with the status quo or who tend to be more concerned about survival than growth as they won t do well over the long run as the saying goes standing still is going backwards how to assess it when assessing a strategy s credibility the goal is to get a general sense of the direction of value and whether it is positive or negative instead of trying to quantify the magnitude focus on management s key assumptions about the customer s present and future demand and how they are going to work closely with them to anticipate and meet their needs talk to the company s competitors because they gen erally will give you a different point of view on the industry and about why some strategies are inferior that said it takes time for some business models to demonstrate that their strategy will work nonetheless always look out for warning signs of strategy drift it s important to understand the system a business has in place to implement its strategy a successful strategy must be tailored to what the company says it stands for how it operates and its limitations it should be committed to an identity rather than just focusing on growth otherwise the odds are that the strategy won t work as investing legend philip fisher put it more successful firms usually have some unique personality traits some special ways of doing things that are particularly effective for their management team this is a positive not a negative sign accordingly look for companies that embrace their corporate culture rather than attempting to recreate it when trying something new similarly favour companies that invest selectively to be different however keep in mind that competitiveness is far more about doing what customers value than the company s core competence yet picking strategic outcomes that are supposed to bring value to the cus hsomer is exactly where many companies fall short always ask what the most important factors are in winning customers to understand how the company is trying to differentiate itself is it price quality or customer service a questionable strategy is one that is difficult to understand or seems to have no prospect of creating value neither creating defensibility nor connecting to the company s culture and limitations the weaker the fit between culture and strategy the worse the performance however strategy can be undermined by operational failure by a misguided view of competition and especially by moves to make the company bigger rather than better finally always ask how management proposes to achieve its profit margins many small companies manage some initial success but are unable to repeat it year after year be sceptical of claims about getting superior returns from doing the same old things better or generating good margins quickly from poor companies the latter is particularly rare except when emerging from a broad recession ideally management s plans will deliver growing volume and earnings over the next five years at least moreover a well defined strategy statement should include the following information 1 description of how the company intends to meet or exceed the needs and wants of its customers 2 description of how the company intends to differentiate a business from the competition 3 prioritisation of opportunities to grow the business and actions that support growth 4 disclosure on competitive moats if any and how the company will gain or widen these to insulate against competition over the long term performance milestones that are set to capture the underlying strategy and determine success link between strategy and capital discipline to ensure a sound financial position ay if there is a well defined and credible strategy for long term growth the stock is scored one point for more on how a strategy should be crafted for long term growth see proxy guide corporate strategy 4 does management tend to deliver on promises on time and according to plan why does it matter management teams that are good at executing tend to be less accident prone and tend to deliver on their promises it is one thing to consistently earn impressive profits but to make commitments and deliver shows both management s confidence in the business and also the visibility of its future earnings also timely execution is usually embedded in a corporate culture where diligence is stimulated and rewarded how to assess it the question to askis has management met the objectives mentioned a few years ago assuming the same ceo is still in place not just talk the talk but walk the talk as action always speaks louder than words here any inconsistencies in management s communication and action should be considered a yellow flag as it will undermine investors faith in management and the company however be wary of recency bias when you evaluate the track record look up prior investor presentations to see how well they did with earlier promises history often repeats itself for example have the proceeds of previous issues not been used as promised or new plans not executed once announced or even never realised managements with good execution skills do not issue frequent profit warnings and downward adjustments of long term financial targets or announce recently discovered kinks in an acquisition made two years earlier if management tends to deliver on their promises on time and according to plan the stock is scored one point 5 has the ceo done it successfully before why does it matter a good ceo will have a solid cv with a history of exemplary performance while past performance is not always a certain indicator of future events a long term track record of success should not be taken lightly someone who has consistently experienced success in lead ership roles has a much better chance of success than someone who has not the bottom line is that unproven leaders come with a high risk premium smart companies and investors recognize potential but they reward performance moreover for managers who have been successful before it s more about legacy and the fun they have as these fac tors are typically not driven by financial considerations how to assess it it s all about having early evidence of product market fit look for a manager with a history of creating long term value for shareholders whether at the current company or in the same industry long term value often manifests itself in the trend of market share if the ceo has proved that they can create a market or gain share or did so in prior roles it will reduce the likelihood of mistakes likewise it is always worth trying to check the eps growth record of the ceo s previous company if it s a pre revenue company look for traction traction can be active users pre sales beta testers letters of intent etc think about the traction twitter generated for five years before beginning to monetize ideally you want a manager who has deep knowledge of the business as there are few cases where outside managers tend to be good hires the best type of outside managers are those who don t make changes quickly and try to understand the business and its customer base a good trait for outside managers is if they solicit the opinions of employees before they implement major changes if instead they start to make changes immediately after joining the business it is likely that he or she will fail lastly formal announcements of the retirement of ceos should not be taken too seriously sometimes they are completely genuine but on other occasions they can be a polite way of saying he or she is incompetent if the ceo has done it successfully before the stock is scored one point 6 does the ceo face personal challenges that might cloud his or her judgement why does it matter this check offers an assessment of whether the chief executive is going through a tough time personally that might cloud his or her judge ment the bottom line is that what goes on in the personal lives of ceos can matter to the company the fact that negative life events like illness bereavements divorce alcohol drug abuse or financial problems often have a negative impact on the business due to their stress and emotional pain should be of great interest to investors think about the impact on focus on behav iour and on the ceo s attitude towards risk a distracted ceo could harm long term decision making and cause the company to miss out on potential opportunities for example in a divorce the ceo may not have the cognitive capacity to focus their energy may be sapped they may also be at risk of losing a large portion of their wealth if so the incentive plan may go out the courthouse window it s not uncommon for divorced ceos to resign for one reason or another within a year or two of their divorce how to assess it the difficulty for investors who might want to understand this risk is that their interest in this kind of information runs directly counter to the ceo s right to personal privacy however following the news will probably do the work for you as these kinds of development tend to leak out another way to getting a sense of what s going on with the ceo s primary non work interests like family health and hobbies is to track social media platforms these can be a great way of gaining insight into somebody s areas of interest outside work still ceos are seldom active on social media platforms accordingly you might have to do some channel checks too see how to conduct your channel checks arguably the ceo s personal problems ought to trigger disclosure when they have clear and direct impact on company performance yet most companies do not disclose them even when they do the reports often only come out later for example when the ceo sells shares to satisfy the terms of a divorce settlement or when health concerns over the ceo prove fatal after the company has covered up their ill ness and downplayed its seriousness for as long as possible if the ceo has personal challenges that might cloud their judgement this check is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for people and is included as additional information to assist with investment decision making proxy guide corporate strategy sound strategy is about being different by doing something important for the customer that is not easily replicable by competi tors namely an antidote to competition in other words companies need products that are unique or offered in a distinctive way to justify high profit margins but also defensibility to protect those high profits in other words in businesses with no sustain able competitive advantages new inventions help customers save money in businesses with sustainable competitive advantages new in ventions help the bottom line and the owners by extension for more on defensibility through sustainable competitive advantages also called moats please read the proxy guide competitive moats strategy is the series of choices made about where to play and how to win to maximize long term value it s as much about choosing what to do as it is choosing what not to do there are basically two choices when it comes to strategies 1 aim to dominate the entire industry or target a market segment in which the company can excel e g regional and or niche market 2 offer bargain prices or the best customer relationship or win by marketing superior products see differentiation strategy below evaluating a management team s strategy in the context of these choices will give an idea of the company s future performance keep in mind that a corporate strategy should be simply explained not overloaded with unnecessary information the latter can reveal leaders lacking in strategic confidence yet strategy is typically something that evolves over time as smart managers are responsive to their markets and as their customers develop it is essentially the idea that a company can craft the conditions to create durable returns for its shareholders to get long periods of outsized returns however as richard rumelt explains in his great book good strategy bad strategy fortunately a leader does not need to get it totally right the organisation s strategy merely has to be more right than those of its rivals successful strategies often owe as much to the inertia of competitors as to the strategy itself generally speaking the most successful growth companies are more specialised have stronger differentiators and pursue a narrower cus tomer base than their more average peers for example when a business tries to appeal strictly to a niche market rather than the masses it will typically benefit in a number of ways premium prices lower costs of acquiring customers and the opportunity to become the brand that consumers associate with the offering itself this partly happens because it provides more value to customers than other players through greater knowledge and expertise about the niche that s why the quality of a business is determined in a broad sense by the quality of its customers differentiation strategy there are basically three ways to differentiate a business from the competition superior product outstanding customer relationship or lowest cost customers know how to identify these types of value and generally don t expect to get them all from a single supplier market leaders typically create a true difference in one value discipline while remaining competitive in the two others moreover customers are generally more loyal to companies with superior product or best relationship than to those with lowest prices so quality is the better way to go if the company has a choice product leadership this involves putting technology to new uses inventing new products or focusing on user friendliness by best in class r d the latter ensures that the pace of innovation is high relative to competitors which creates a virtuous cycle of the strong getting stronger rational but genuine innovation makes all the difference as long as the company stays one step ahead of the competition as they attempt to copy its success this includes actual physical and perceived differences like a unique feature or reputation of being superior common moat sources network effects special assets and brand loyalty customer closeness this involves focusing on the customer more than anything else by being responsive to their pain points needs and desires in order to deliver the best total solution some make this a true benefit to best serve customer needs and offer convenience and efficiency success depends on a niche market focus and strong sales force with appropriate targeting efficient management of customer relationships and tailored offers this is particularly valuable for complex products where the salesperson acts as an advisor as it typically includes all sup porting elements such as training installation and easy ordering however it is trickier to maintain customer intimacy at scale common moat sources switching costs and brand loyalty low cost provider products positioned in line with the market average at the best price with a minimum of hassle ie reliable product or speedy service the low cost provider s product range is simple above all as costs are slashed by cutting out elements that don t address the needs of the majority moreover cost leadership is critical to success something that comes from having large scale and operational excellence common moat sources scale economies and process power finally operational excellence is a prerequisite to succeeding with any differentiation strategy over time but does not by itself assure differential margins that is to say operational excellence is not a strategy in itself as competitors can often easily imitate the improve ments yielded by it eventually arbitraging out the value to the business pursuing operational excellence is simply an ongoing process of improvement to become better at the things that make the business profitable and valuable today the bottom line is that companies should try to be unique instead of trying to be the best at something in other words when it comes to strategy focus should be on invention and then building competitive moats around it the first cause of a strategy is always invention innovation means reacting to trends or shifts much faster than competitors in order to stay different it s about reacting to significant structural changes in the industry s economics or customer behaviour it involves taking advantage of new technologies business models or using existing ideas in a new way whether as an early stage company or a mature company considering a new direction nonetheless there are also rare times when no new opportunities have developed and no new risks have appeared here doing more of the same may be the most reasonable strategy growth strategy for ceos to win the support of their board and investors they need the ability to develop and explain how their strategy can scale up not just how they will differentiate their business to survive in this sense the goal for growth should be for the largest number of customers possible to enjoy the product on offer without diluting its competitive advantages still the objective of sound growth is not only to make gains but to build defensibility through sustainable competitive advantages with out the latter high returns cannot be protected over time and growth will create little or no value it will merely be a commodity business because as soon as the growth in demand slows down the profits will vanish in other words a competitive advantage that isn t sustain able will merely be an opportunistic window of time for the business for example strategies that focus on market share alone typically come at a high cost as they often erode profit margins and competitive advantages while their offerings become commoditized high levels of capital spending and rapid increases in market share often as re sult of deal mania are tell tale signs of a management racing out of control all the same companies pursuing high growth tend to follow three well known strategies 1 serving broader stakeholder needs 2 creating new markets 3 changing the rules of the game the best opportunities for growth are those that are focused on core or related markets complementary products for example where the company s existing competitive moats may give it a defence against competition the next best growth opportunities come from entering virgin markets with no dominant player enjoying sustainable competitive advantages to fulfil a yet unmet demand this avoids price wars from head on competition with established players as it s incredibly difficult to replicate all of industry leaders natural advantages from brand loyalty to customers and assets the third best growth opportunity comes from changing the game entirely in an established market through disruption the latter two are key when a company s growth potential is limited within its core markets to succeed in changing the rules of the game it naturally takes a counter positioning strategy that involves innovation of a new superior business model that established competitors does not adopt due to anticipated cannibalisation of their existing business this business model by itself constitutes a competitive moat a special asset nonetheless a counter positioning strategy tends to first target lower end customers or lower feature products with a seemingly inferior product and then evolve to be good enough for high end users also a successful counter positioning strategy typically involves a different organisation with different people world view and compensation structures compared to the established competitors the idea of a counter positioning strategy is discussed in detail by hamilton helmer in his remarkable book 7 powers the foundations of business strategy which i recommend highly capital allocation analysis does management appear to use shareholders money well ne of management s most important jobs is to allocate capital with the objective of building long term value per share success ful capital allocation means converting inputs including money things ideas and people into something more valuable than they would be otherwise simply put capital allocation is the link between business value and shareholder value one benefit of investing in a management team with great capital allocation skill is that you can thrive in market downturns value cre ation in these companies can come from share repurchases or organic growth in market share or compelling acquisitions basically ceos have five choices for deploying capital investing in existing operations acquiring other businesses paying dividends paying down debt or repurchasing stock and three alternatives for raising it tapping internal cash flow issuing debt or raising equity the best way of assessing managers skill in capital allocation is to review whether their decisions have improved earnings per share over time if the chairman and ceo are long tenured it s easier to imagine that future capital allocation will be similar to past capital allocation ifa ceo has been running a company for decades a look at the long term stock chart should suffice the best ceos tend to be the ones who regard capital allocation as their most important task yet most companies pay little attention to it due to inexperience in capital markets and corporate finance most ceos get the top job because of operational excellence corporate poli tics or other skills that have nothing to do with allocating capital also many boards are similarly inexperienced when it comes to capital allocation capital allocation checklist 1 do the company s incentive plans encourage long term value creation 2 do investments and acquisitions focus on strengthening the core business 3 is there consistency in the people responsible for capital allocation 4 has the company taken opportunistic action over an attractively priced stock 5 have total shares in issue remained constant or decreased over time 6 does the company lack a sound dividend payout policy 1 do the company s incentive plans encourage long term value creation why does it matter this check offers an assessment of whether the incentives a company has in place encourage judicious capital allocation incentives matter when managers choose between optimising the appearance of accounting and maximising the present value of future cash flows managers who are paid handsomely to misallocate capital will do so the objective of capital allocation is to build long term value per share in the belief that investors will ultimately follow value if the mar ket fails to reflect it management can take action by sharpening communication or buying back stock incentive programs frequently encourage behaviour that is not in the best interest of long term shareholders misaligned incentives tend to manifest themselves in bad decision making and value destruction large bonuses and stock options have been held responsible for overly risky behaviour and short term strategies for example if remuneration is roughly correlated with the size of the company management may do value destroying m a deals to grow this could lead to a debt fuelled buying spree leaving a hole in the company s balance sheet as howard marks advocates we must be sure to give adequate attention to second order effects how to assess it in order for an incentive plan to reward long term performance it must tie compensation to results over a time period of at least five years where there are mitigating factors that would justify a shorter performance period these need to be carefully explained to shareholders given that the average ceo stays barely five years in the role there is typically a mismatch between their aims and those of shareholders that is why long term schemes of at least five years that move beyond tenure period are preferable these do not incentivise inappropriate risk taking or create adverse unintended long term consequences agood complementary sign is a significant length of deferral of variable pay this should apply not just to annual bonuses but also long term incentive plans companies should explain any mitigating factors that may justify not deferring variable pay equally they should minimise cliff edge vesting sliding scales starting from suitably low levels of initial payment are preferable significant incentive awards should only be made for exceptional performance where strong performers are differentiated from average performers performance targets should be sufficiently challenging so that senior managers rarely receive 100 of their potential bonus entitlement unless they have been truly exceptional likewise a good rule of thumb is for 50 of the incentives to be based on profits and 50 on underlying business targets reflecting strategic objectives if management focuses on delivering strong cash flows and re allocating capital sensibly the share price typically looks after itself ac cordingly the ideal compensation structures are those that reward long term value creation that s why the ultimate incentive plans are those that replace long term incentive pay with a requirement that executives own a multiple of their annual salary in company stock or pay bonuses in the form of restricted stock and hold it for long periods of time for more on ownership please read question number two does the management team own a significant stake in the business in the ownership strength checklist in cases where management lacks sufficient skin in the game you should look for good value creation factors or business targets these should focus on operational drivers key performance indicators like cost control customer satisfaction and return on capital the met rics which dictate the business s success or failure such indirect incentives should stop managers from focusing too much on short term share price movements according to warren buffett a good incentive plan should be 1 tailored to the economics of the specific operating business 2 simple in character so that the degree to which they are being realized can be easily measured and 3 directly related to the daily activities of the plan participants success measures like market share accounting income sales absolute growth and ebitda are all considered to be poor proxies for value creation for example an excessive focus on sales growth could result in a willingness to sacrifice margins to generate incremental growth at any cost likewise if expansion of market share is the only thing that matters it is easy to sacrifice profitability or cash flow along the way to achieve that end examples of poor incentives are option awards or other traditional bonus structures that provide managers with upside rewards without downside risks in the event of poor performance other bad signs to look for are a lack of incentive plans no disclosure absence of finan cial targets and the lack of a long term plan likewise beware any retesting of performance conditions for incentive plans if incentives are primarily tied to long term value creation factors over a time period of at least five years or less if mitigating factors justify this the stock is scored one point likewise if management as a group owns 5 or more of equity or a majority of senior managers have a significant portion of their net worth in the company shares with a value of five times or more their base salary for example the stock is also scored one point unvested shares in incentive arrangements should not count towards the total 2 do investments and acquisitions focus on strengthening the core business why does it matter successful companies typically stick with what they know best and strengthen their core businesses and competitive advantages rather than engage in conglomerate building such companies only acquire companies that are closely related and can offer clear synergies these bolt on acquisitions generally have higher success rates than bigger transformational m a transactions put simply these compa nies try to stick to what they are good at because management is under pressure to grow and put the best spin on their uniqueness to exploit opportunities it is not uncommon for investors to be led into over optimistic conclusions about the prospects of new investments for most declining businesses management tends to redeploy cash flow into things outside of their core competencies to diversify as a desperate attempt in the pursuit of growth such compromises and inconsistencies will erode a company s distinct positioning by becoming all things to all customers the bottom line is that investing for low returns either through acquisitions or expanding into lower return areas can undermine the overall quality of the business the erosion of longer term returns for the sake of short term profit gains will eventually lead to the perma nent destruction of shareholder wealth how to assess it make sure that the company is reinvesting enough keeping r d up at a proven rate of return to stay competitive equally though be vigilant that any investment and acquisition strengthens the competitive advantage of the core business or fills a strategic gap the latter could be access to new territories product segments or technologies or help to achieve growth or critical mass by way of increasing mar ket share always be very cautious towards management teams that are more concerned with growing bigger than using acquisitions to create more value for the company and its shareholders sometimes business transformation is necessary because the underlying market is changing in a way which is both rapid and unforeseen yet in most cases risky transformational projects can be avoided if management is visionary and keeps the company evolving towards where it needs to be in five to 10 years in contrast serial acquirers also known as m a compounders do rather small and often private deals rather than transformative public deals acquisitions of small private companies tend to be priced more favourably than public companies and generate much better returns especially when the deals are done through direct contact with sellers to avoid auctions small acquisitions also imply lower risk for the buyer in addition it s reasonable to assume that multiple acquisitions also build capabilities for serial acquirers acquisitions are a sys tematic process at the core of the strategy for any acquisition to succeed it s critical that management understands the business they are acquiring intimately this explains why vertical deals are seldom successful for this reason it is particularly worrying if the acquired company serves different customers or doesn t fit into the core competency of the business and even more so if the customers and employees don t remain with the acquired business as warren buffett once said look for management teams that stick with what they understand and let their abilities not their egos determine what they attempt a business in flat or slightly declining markets will usually serve shareholders best by focusing on retaining and maybe growing their dominant position within their niche generating as much cash as possible and returning any excess that their strategy does not require to owners through dividends and buybacks yet maturing companies usually continue to invest despite declining returns on invested capital look at the cash flow statement for evidence of m a another testament to people who make good decisions is what they do when things don t work out as planned a real tick in the box in favour of the management being a good capital allocator would be if they can create shareholder value even though an investment or ac quisition isn t panning out as hoped divestments spin offs of small non core businesses are another way for companies to strengthen their core businesses yet for most managers it s an unnatural act to shrink their prestige and span of control by spinning off and selling businesses by the time it becomes clear to them that divestment is the best course of action shareholders have often been asking for it for years if investments and acquisitions have tended to strengthen the company s competitive advantages and core business the stock is scored one point 3 is there consistency in the people responsible for capital allocation why does it matter this check offers a prediction as to whether future capital allocation at the company will be similar to past capital allocation if the chair man ceo and cfo are long tenured it s easier to anticipate that future capital allocation will be similar to past capital allocation or if the person responsible for capital allocation has a connection to the company s founder short tenured leadership typically lacks deep knowledge about the business which may result in poor capital allocation decisions also capital allocation takes time and is usually largely the work of the current ceo s predecessor how to assess it the key question to ask is who is responsible for capital allocation for a very young company that is less than 10 years old the answer is always short tenured executives in this case look for the presence of a founder or controlling family to influence capital allocation it could also be a former top lieutenant of the founder or a refounder who influences the capital allocation the latter is someone who has reshaped the business through some sort of crisis it s true though that over time most companies drift away from the control of the founder or the founder s family as more and more outside executives are hired who haven t spent their whole careers at the company in this case look for a long tenured chairman ceo or cfo as the capital allocator also make sure that the person responsible for capital allocation has long experience in capital markets if the chairman ceo and cfo s median tenure and experience with capital markets is over five years the stock is scored one point like wise if the person responsible for capital allocation has a connection to the company s founder and more than five years of experience with capital markets the stock is also scored one point 4 has the company taken opportunistic action over an attractively priced stock why does it matter this check offers a gauge of management s capital allocating skill by assessing if they have created value by acting on attractive valu ations it includes a history of raising capital opportunistically repurchasing stock at low valuations and using a high priced stock as a currency to make acquisitions this typically means that the company is exhibiting counter cyclical behaviour and patience by accumulating cash to be able to strike when things are cheap in other words it looks to invest when competitors are not and vice versa acting opportunistically and not overpaying for things implies that management has a clear sense of what their assets are worth and is willing to act on that knowledge whether that means buying or selling the difference between value and price should always guide man agement decisions how to assess it the bottom line is that competent capital allocators usually take on more debt and deploy additional cash instead of hoarding it during a recession when good opportunities arise they are typically opportunistic in taking advantage of a high or low priced stock in three ways fundraising in fundraising share dilution is probably the biggest risk to investors that s why it s so important to raise capital oppor tunistically when one can rather than when one must to minimise the dilution in earnings per share be on the lookout for ceos who seem to regularly undertake financings that are more dilutive than similarly situated peer companies watch out for badly structured financing vehicles like convertibles rights issues and warrants that are based on the market price at the time of conversion or exercise such structures tend to be too dilutive and encourage pump and dump behaviour something that is com mon among financially distressed companies that have to resort to rescue financing by issuing new shares in a crisis situation acquisitions market conditions play a significant role in m a transactions when an acquirer s shares are considered overvalued man agement may prefer to pay for the acquisition through a share exchange the shares are essentially a form of currency however beware executives who pay strategic prices for acquisitions big companies typically acquire start ups early in their growth to stay at the cutting edge of technology particularly when the quest for growth pushes them outside their zone of core competence in general acquisitions that create value through improved efficiencies of the merged organisation should not be attributed to capital allocation skill it is just management led improvement that typically reflects a cost conscious culture acquiring a business that hasn t been run efficiently buybacks because share buybacks decrease the number of shares outstanding they have the effect of increasing earnings per share if the stock is undervalued these repurchases can add materially to the value of the business savvy share shrinkers can use substantial buybacks when the stock is cheap to create a double dip for shareholders and turn solid growth into exceptional shareholder returns over along period of time also keep in mind that dividends are taxed on receipt whereas the tax on the capital gains resulting from share buy backs is deferred until the investor sells if the company has a share repurchase program in place it s good if management communicates a commitment to buy only at a particular price or valuation conversely it s especially concerning when management announces an enticing buyback plan but never follows through however beware executives using buybacks simply as a means of increasing earnings per share or offsetting dilution from employee stock options with little regard for the price paid conversely if a company announces a share buyback of more than 10 it is considered a positive catalyst supply of the company s stock is tightened as shares overhanging the market are mopped up and cancelled by the buying programme if the company has acted opportunistically by taking advantage of a high or low priced stock the stock is scored one point 5 have total shares in issue decreased over time or remained constant why does it matter companies have a number of ways of financing their operations the best do it internally via retained earnings and cash flows which are then reinvested at attractive rates of return to grow the business the worst do it externally by over borrowing and or frequent share is sues this has a dilutive impact on the business meaning that earnings now have to go around more investors research has long shown that companies that issue new stock tend to underperform the stock market in subsequent years while those who buy back shares tend to outperform increasing shares in issue can mean that the company is not generating enough cash flow to sup port the growth of the business how to assess it check whether total shares in issue have either remained constant or decreased over the last three years the exception is if the company has been able to increase eps despite increasing total shares outstanding this means that that capital used from the issue of securities was used to grow the business faster than it otherwise could have the latter is generally the case for acquisition stories if total shares in issue either remain constant or decrease over time the stock is scored one point 6 does the company lack a sound dividend payout policy why does it matter this check offers an assessment of the company s dividend policy this reflects management s confidence in future earnings growth companies with a sound dividend policy have clear dividend policies in place with consistent track records and rational payout ratios rela tive to others in the industry paying out dividends forces companies to be more stringent on their use of capital as dividends are real cash outlays for companies that can t be restated also once companies start paying dividend they are reluctant to stop or cut dividends since it can drive the stock price down and reflect poorly on management s abilities yet dividends are not normatively good if the business is funded poorly or if there are better uses for the money how to assess it any company that intends to distribute a portion of its annual earnings should have an announced dividend policy that is outlined in its annual report every company should revisit its dividend policy from time to time doing so can greatly improve the strategy debate among a company s senior managers below are some quality criteria to consider when evaluating the dividend payout policy clear dividend policies should always be clear to reduce shareholders uncertainty basically this involves explaining what share of earn ings will be paid out as dividends each year this is known as the payout ratio having a clear dividend policy is generally good governance it gives investors a better understanding of the business they are investing in and what to expect it is much easier for a fixed income fund manager to manage their portfolio when they know the dividend policy of each company in the portfolio after all these funds are also committed to declare a certain amount of dividend for their owners consistent companies that pay consistent dividends are generally trying to increase them annually and cutting them very reluctantly consistency is key when comparing the numbers over the past few years yet dividend growth can be more difficult for companies with a high payout ratio unless earnings growth is strong investors don t like surprises a special dividend while nice in the moment creates confusion for long term investors this is typically the result of a dividend policy not being in place with payouts being instead set by the board in an ad hoc way and approved by the annual general meeting this will confuse owners and drive away would be investors as it makes them less likely to stick to a strategy with divi dend paying stocks rational several considerations go into interpreting if the payout ratio is rational most importantly the company s level of maturity a growth oriented company that aims to expand develop new products and move into new markets would be expected to reinvest most or all of its earnings and could be forgiven for having a low or even zero payout ratio ifa company can generate high returns on reinvested earnings 15 then it should reinvest it or make value enhancing acquisitions or buy back stock at cheap levels rather than pay its earnings out as dividends the value of such companies compounds at a much higher rate than if the earnings were paid out to investors as dividends even so dividends are often prioritized by investors and pundits in the end investors should seek to maximise their total return not yield the reality is that dividends are the route to average returns those who want a dividend can effectively generate dividend type wealth by selling shares instead thomas phelps said it best in his book 100 to 1 in the stock market when you buy a cow to milk don t plan to race her against your neighbour s horse paying out capital through dividends only makes sense if the company lacks great opportunities to put it to work this can even be considered value destructive if the payment is effectively financed by debt or equity the latter is the reason a company with no earnings shouldn t pay dividends however when companies with poor capital allocators retain a very high proportion of earnings there is a great tendency for poor investments to be made which subsequently leads to poor earnings growth and return on equity it s fair to expect different payout ratios from different industries cyclical and capital intensive businesses and those with significant value enhancing investment opportunities should pay out a smaller percentage of earnings compared to companies in defensive indus tries or those with fewer reinvestment opportunities the key is to gauge the payout ratio over a business cycle and in relation to industry peers apayout ratio above 70 is generally irrational as it might mean the company is failing to reinvest enough of its profits in the business to grow also if business trends unexpectedly fall there might not be enough profits to keep paying the dividend a high payout ratio often means the company s earnings are faltering or that it is trying to entice investors who find little else to get excited about if the company lacks a dividend payout policy or if the policy is considered unsound this check is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for people and is included as additional information to assist with investment decision making investor communication analysis is communication with shareholders open and honest key factor is the attitude of management towards shareholders look for management teams that are candid and honest about the pluses and minuses in their business you can gain much insight into this by probing shareholder communication the bot tom line is that analysing words is as important as analysing numbers the right breed of management teams let the results speak for themselves and those results should be stated as conservatively as possible this type of management typically follow the under promise and over deliver mantra too often though senior executives are expected to deliver short term results and as a result feel compelled to use unclear language about how they will meet these expectations management teams that tell you too much are almost always the ones that do too little such information is rarely true in the first place your default response to whatever management tells you about the business should be to validate whether it s true or not be sceptical of any statement that management tries to sell to you avoid companies that try to present themselves differently than they behave remember that managerial laggards typically sing the same tune assuring investors that good times are just around the corner believing these claims frequently leads to investment mistakes investor communication checklist 1 is management sincere and upfront about the business s difficulties and mistakes 2 does the ceo uphold company values and link them to its success 3 is management s communication timely and clear 4 does management consistently use the same story and key metrics 5 is communication focused on long term business value 6 is management s responsiveness to inquiries poor 1 is management sincere and upfront about the business s difficulties and mistakes why does it matter asa shareholder you have a right to know the challenges and opportunities that face the company how management communicates mistakes is very important being transparent when times are tough goes a long way in building trust and is genuinely appreciated by the investment community great managers communicate both things they have done well and those they have done poorly in order to paint the most accurate picture possible sharing good and bad news with the same degree of regularity and forthrightness enables the company to build its repu tation on transparency in contrast be cautious towards an over promotional management team that only emphasizes good news in their communication the ability to admit mistakes can be a barometer of overall truthfulness if a top executive has proven to be less than truthful there is no telling what other skeletons there are in the corporate closet that have not yet come to light how to assess it compare three years of shareholder letters in the annual reports and see if they discuss problems openly and how they address them ask yourself if the ceo offers a frank report about mistakes that were made and challenges that were met or do they only mention successes look for managers who openly discuss with investors about their mistakes what happened and how they plan to get things back on track rather than simply saying that they had a problem all the same you want management to have a healthy dose of paranoia and candour as they are fully able to recognise and communicate the challenges they face but they must not have all the answers on difficult strategic is sues where the outcome is at best uncertain no one is mistake free so you should be really concerned about any company where shareholder letters don t discuss problems this approach tells you that either the team is unable to recognise the problems they face or is unwilling to communicate them either under mines management s credibility the same is true if management make excuses for not communicating with shareholders when con fronted with adversity another sign of poor shareholder communication is when mangers offer excuses for weak results and downplay disappointments rather than addressing the issues in many of these letters success is often attributed to management efforts but failures are attributed to exoge nous reasons if so this is a sign of amanagement that avoids its responsibility if you start to see statements from companies operating in a similar business and they are increasingly cautious don t ignore them even if your company says things are still fine it may only be a matter of time before the downtrend reaches them as well the weakest see it first but generally a downturn in an industry will catch everyone in the end when a company forecasts improvements several quarters in the future despite a changing economic environment it conveys hope rather than facts if management is sincere and upfront about the business s difficulties and mistakes the stock is scored one point 2 does the ceo uphold company values and link them to its success why does it matter almost every company defines a set of company values to underpin the efforts of employees to achieve its goals although stating values is common they can still set a company apart from its competition by clarifying its identity and serving as a behavioral compass for employees clearly defined and shared values directly impact the bottom line as they create the foundation for day to day operational decisions they guide employees in making moral and practical decisions however what is written in a statement of values is of little importance unless those values are reflected in how the company operates people act with integrity when their words and actions are aligned culture lives in the way things get done as the industrialist andrew carnegie once said the older i get the less i listen to what someone says and the more i watch what they do the bottom line is that a company s culture is highly important as it is one of the most stable aspects over time how to assess it culture always starts at the top it s the values of the ceo which are transferred down in the company values are only incorporated into the culture when employees buy in to them and become accountable for upholding them that s why the ceo plays a central role in how well employees understand and adopt the company s values viewing them as a guide to acceptable and unacceptable behaviour and over time employees self select into or out of a culture to find meaningful statements of company values you have to look at executive communications and shareholder letters for engaging stories that describe how the company s history and strategies have been shaped by its values look for business and leadership principles the company is built upon to be appropriately described they must be directly linked to a company s success after all stories are the foundation of identity and culture lives in the way things get done it s a good sign if employees are recognised in shareholder letters as being essential to producing the desired business results as it signals that the ceo is focused on executing its strategy through a strong culture in all cases you should be very cautious if ceos spend too much time talking about themselves rather than acknowledging the people they lead if the ceo links company values to success in shareholder letters or other executive communications the stock is scored one point if un sure or company values cannot be found as meaningfully described this check fails by default 3 is management s communication timely and clear why does it matter managers who work to help investors understand their business and its growth prospects are a sign of a shareholder friendly company a great management team communicates swiftly and comprehensively but is also easy to listen to and understand this is particularly true when they answer questions about important aspects of the business when great managers encounter complex concepts they do their best to educate investors about them by providing discussion of and insight into what they mean similarly they explain clearly to investors how the business is operating and try to make sure market expec tations are reasonable in the light of current information the point is that people trust what they know and understand how to assess it asign of good shareholder communication is when all get the same level of information promptly at the same time and explained in a way that anyone can understand if you find it difficult to listen to managers or reading what they write there s something wrong you don t want managers employing complicated or non standard terminology but rather words and numbers that are easy to understand when it comes to the financial statements they should try to guide investors and explain what to look for asign of poor communication with shareholders is when in response to some concern statements become longer less specific and more ambiguous it can seem as if the impact of every word has been weighed checked and reconsidered before it has been committed to paper typically this means long on detail but short on insight in contrast when all is going well company statements are clear and concise atip when analysing shareholder letters is to start reading and highlight all clichés such as employees are our greatest assets our future is bright and our financial strength this kind of meaningless jargon and platitudes diminishes anyone s understanding of the business and trust in the leadership if you see too much fluff or more highlighted text than black ink on the pages it is a warning sign whenever it happens you need to ask yourself does the ceo not understand the business or does he or she not want the owners to understand it after all you want to understand the business better when you finish the annual report than when you picked it up other warning signs are if management appears to be reluctant to share information about the most important part of the business as well as deliberate omissions of important facts or statements particularly beware management that excludes critics and provides selec tive access to management if management disclose significant matters in a timely and unambiguous manner the stock is scored one point 4 does management consistently use the same story and key metrics why does it matter the story and key benchmarks should be consistent a lack of consistency in a company s message over time raises concerns about the business s strategic direction after all if the company s long term goals and high level strategy change every few years how can anyone have an idea about where the company will be in five or 10 years time to put it simply a business is at great risk when leaders lose their focus you should always worry about companies if the script changes a disciplined and consistent execution of a company s strategy over time is ameasure of management s ability as well as their trustworthiness leaders who lack discipline will model the wrong behaviours and will inevitably spread themselves too thin how to assess it look for consistency where the executives set out a strategy and stick to it regular meetings with management and comparisons of com mentary in the annual shareholder letters each year give the opportunity to determine the consistency of the strategic intentions plans and results also by asking the same questions to management over a period of time you can ascertain if the story remains the same or if it changes it s a bad sign if some parts of a strategy are omitted while new priorities are introduced unexpectedly this is typically a sign of problems ahead watch out for management that cherry picks performance metrics according to what looks good in the current year for example focus ing on adjusted operating earnings one year ebitda margin the next and the year after that on something else also be alive to the risk of mixed messages with the cfo communicating a different story than the ceo or the iro if shareholder communication consistently use the same story and key metrics year after year the stock is scored one point 5 is communication focused on long term business value why does it matter the pressure to increase near term profits while keeping up with industry peers is certainly one of the major challenges of today s busi ness culture warren buffett once said managers that always promise to make the numbers will at some point be tempted to make up the numbers great management teams focus their communication on long term business value corporate leaders should think in terms of years not quarters they communicate their long term financial objectives and broader operational measures that shape the business prospects and rather gives ranges than point estimates long term financial objectives could be major drivers of income such as volume targets rev enue targets or major operating costs an over promotional management team is never a good thing as they are managing expectations rather than managing businesses ultimately a hard sell usually indicates that some form of financing is on the way and when investors eventually discover that the man agement overstated prospects or made false projections it becomes very hard for the company to regain its former reputation over pro motional managements are also more likely to be involved in frauds how to assess it you can tell by management s actions companies with a long range outlook typically pay attention to cash generation rather than fickle quarterly earnings numbers they focus on long term targets and make strategic investments in areas that may only yield results many years down the road for example a management team investing significant resources in delighting customers and improving products is a great sign of a long term orientation acompany that is obsessed with quarterly earnings guidance and then comments on whether the targets were beaten or not would defi nitely give the impression of being focused on the short term this comes into even greater focus when management talks about the stock price before mentioning the business additionally read the annual shareholder letters and try to discern whether mangers view shareholders as business partners and co owners rather than a pesky group they must deal with each quarter letters should contain terms like intrinsic value return on capital employed and free cash flow per share rather than simply discussing sales growth if management s communication is focused on long term business value as opposed to current accounting earnings like short term guid ance the stock is scored one point 6 is management s responsiveness to inquiries poor why does it matter shareholder friendly management maintains a responsive dialogue with the investment community such mangers are typically happy to provide additional flavour to anyone who is interested yet some management teams seem to be suspicious of the investment commu nity and view journalists analysts and investors as a necessary evil however the more responsive a company is to issues and concerns the more credible it will appear management does not need to act on shareholder concerns but they should at least listen and respond if management fails to respond to emails the company will lose investors and alienate analysts hurting its valuation sooner rather than later on the other hand it makes sense for executives to limit time consuming interaction with investors and analysts as long as the company provides informative annual reports with detailed business information if executives focus their time on customers employees and product they are doing the right thing for investors too after all such a prioritisation will have a greater long term impact on shareholder value and will probably ease investor relations considerably too how to assess it being responsive means actually responding to questions and concerns by email or phone managers don t need to immediately pick up a ringing phone to be responsive but they do need to call back investors and analysts shouldn t have to wait days or weeks before they hear back to get an answer a good benchmark response time is 24 hours but more than a few days is a poor sign do not confuse being responsive with appear to be responsive the latter refers to the fact that many managers give the appearance of being responsive by addressing current issues and key questions through q as faqs webcasts memos management interviews and through company website updates all of this is clearly positive but it s not being responsive if the company is considered to be unresponsive to questions and concerns this check is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for people and is included as additional information to assist with investment decision making executive compensation analysis does the company have reasonable levels of executive pay eo compensation should be examined for abuse if a material amount of value is being directed to managers at the expense of passive shareholders and particularly if it does so even in tough times it s better to look upon them with suspicion it is absolutely paramount that management s interests are aligned with those of shareholders management related risks often stem from inadequate alignment of interest between shareholders and corporate executives akey to understanding how a management team will probably act is to study how its members are compensated appropriate base salary bonus structure and performance hurdles are required to motivate managers to make prudent decisions that benefit the company and not just themselves examine the company s proxy statement to see the metrics upon which management s variable compensation targets are based looking for the possibility that such metrics could create adverse unintended consequences executive compensation checklist 1 does the ceo s pay appear reasonable for a company of this size and profit level 2 does the company disclose bonus measures and targets 3 does the ceo s pay appear to be in line with other executives 4 do the ceo s exit payments appear reasonable 5 is the company free of any abuse of options or equity based incentives 6 does the ceo s pay exceed performance relative to peers 1 does the ceo s pay appear reasonable for a company of this size and profit level why does it matter this check highlights if the ceo s pay appears excessive nothing is wrong with paying ceos well but to pay them excessively may indicate a lavish corporate governance culture highly paid ceos typically create a money minded culture in the organisation such ceos usually don t command respect from employees this presents a risk of damage to the company that will probably be reflected in its earn ings sooner or later as it has implications for customer perception and corporate culture even so variable pay devices like profit sharing stock awards individual bonus plans and the like are nearly always positive they re often the mark of a company that truly values its people they may help to build culture and long term loyalty and thus foster retention but too much of a good thing tends to lead to bad behaviour how to assess it to determine whether shareholders are receiving value for money the ceo s pay is compared to a peer group of at least 12 companies the pay mentioned in this question includes only base salary bonus and non equity incentive compensation perks pensions and or eq uity awards are not considered for this question if the ceo s cash compensation ranks outside the 80th percentile among similarly sized companies by number of employees and profit level the stock is scored one point 2 does the company disclose bonus measures and targets why does it matter we believe that company disclosure is a meaningful signal in its own right limited disclosure is often a sign that further investigation is needed both to rule out poor practice and as a prerequisite to an effective comparison of company performance against peers we expect specific targets to be disclosed for past years with sufficient transparency for shareholders to decide if payments have reflected performance fairly companies that report only to meet the regulatory disclosure requirements are missing a prime opportunity to engage new and existing investors with the business more fully how to assess it examine the company s proxy statement and annual reports for the metrics upon which management s variable compensation targets are based some companies justify limited disclosure by the commercial sensitivity of their targets but this argument has been used too loosely when commercial sensitivity is cited you should demand sufficient additional information to be disclosed the following year if the company discloses executive bonus measures and targets the stock is scored one point 3 does the ceo s pay appear to be in line with other executives why does it matter the bottom line is that limited difference in compensation among the management team is a good sign if the ceo makes much more than the other senior executives this is an issue of corporate governance as it is usually a sign of an all powerful ceo likewise the pay gap provides insight into the quality of succession planning and management of retention risk the possibility that executives will jump ship for new posts offering more attractive rewards at the same time note that pay gap often varies with the structure of the executive team whether there is a coo for example and their tenures overall ceo dominance may indicate long term problems with the company s compensation practices and more broadly its board level management and oversight a board that isn t vigilant over executive compensation may not be on top of financial controls either how to assess it check whether the next highest paid executive s total pay is more than 50 of the ceo s total pay when considering variable pay elements include the annualised value of outstanding incentive schemes share and option plans upon full allotment calculated at the current share price if the ceo s total pay is less than 200 of the next highest paid executive s total pay the stock is scored one point 4 do the ceo s exit payments appear reasonable why does it matter this check highlights if the ceo benefits from excessive exit payments a so called golden parachute these are lavish severance packages complete with perks for life that are fit for a king guaranteed pension benefits far outstripping the value of benefits provided to employ ees or loans to executives that are eventually forgiven all send a clear message to shareholders we do not respect you as owners and we do not feel accountable to you as owners also such ceos typically treat their companies like atms how to assess it examine the footnotes in the company s proxy statement and annual reports for severance exit payments exit payments upon a change of control that are in excess of 12 month base salary and bonus are considered excessive in other cases of termination of their employment it is considered reasonable if the ceo gets a six months mutual period of notice or longer period of notice that follows according to law and the right to 12 months of severance pay on condition that the company is the party giving notice executives should not be entitled to any additional compensation in conjunction with the termination of their employment no anti takeover provisions poison pills no good bye perks no gold plated pension or lifetime health benefits neither should there be an au tomatic waiving of performance conditions on a change in control situation where you would expect awards to be pro rated for perfor mance and time ideally entitlements should be the same as for the rest of the workforce however industry practices are currently some way from this ideal and it will take time to transition consequently you should look for differences in pension arrangements for executive directors and the rest of the workforce to be disclosed and justified the pay mentioned in this question includes only base salary perks and bonus long term cash and or equity awards are not considered for this question if exit payments for the ceo don t appear excessive the stock is scored one point 5 is the company free of any abuse of options or equity based incentives why does it matter investors need to be aware of dilutive shares warrants and options as they reduce existing shareholders ownership of a company such incentive structures aim to replicate the sense of ownership in management but often fall short instead they only reinforce a short term focus and incentivise management to keep one eye on their stock option vesting dates they do not promote long term sustainable busi ness growth the problem is particularly acute when executives hold many more shares through options than they own directly in this situation they don t share in the downside as they only stand to profit and will break even in the worst case scenario this may make them more prone to take bets with huge upside and downside for the company and simply hope for the best tech companies typically keep payrolls low by issuing options year after year which entails major shareholder dilution however this strategy also gives the company tax credit on the share issuance increasing cash flow after all exceptional managers who earn cash bonuses based on the performance of their own business can simply buy the company s shares directly from the open market if they want to rather than at shareholders expense how to assess it for option and stock based incentives to be considered shareholder friendly no more than 2 of the company may be transferred to employees annually via options or equity and transactions should be priced at the full business value not at a discount also incentive plans need to have an earn out period of at least 36 months anything shorter makes clear that management prioritize itself and its key employees over shareholders restricted stock is always better than options as it exposes the owner to the downside if the stock falls moreover it has to be counted as an expense on the income statement if stock options are used they should be priced at full business value non executive directors should not participate in option or stock based plans as this puts them at the same level as executives whom they should be monitoring and deciding remuneration for likewise only individuals who can influence the stock price should be paid in eq uity which limits the number of eligible executives and key employees individuals with limited responsibility should be rewarded for good work with cash bonuses rather than equities or stock options all of the following criteria must be fulfilled for the stock to score one point 1 dilution of 2 annually via options or equity 2 earn out period of 36 months per incentive program 3 options and equity priced at full business value no discount 4 ceo must directly own more shares than they are allotted options on 5 only executive managers and key employees are included in incentive schemes if disclosure on option or equity based incentives is poor or missing this check fails by default 6 does the ceo s pay exceed performance relative to peers why does it matter this check highlights whether the ceo is underperforming in relation to his or her total pay shareholder friendly ceo pay should be aligned with the company s share performance to determine whether shareholders are receiving value for money the best way to keep ceo pay in line with performance is to make sure that corporate boards include shareholders with large stakes in the company companies that pay bonuses out of total stock return aren t going to issue additional stock if it depresses roe they can be counted on to minimize the growth of assets generally and increase owners equity specifically how to assess it to determine whether shareholders are receiving value for money a peer group of at least 12 companies is compared on total ceo com pensation versus total shareholder return tsr the tsr is measured by the compound annual appreciation in share price over a five year period assuming that dividends are reinvested in the stock the measure is calculated as the difference between the slope of weighted linear regressions for total pay and for total share holder returns over the period performance is considered to exceed pay if the company is positioned below the red line in the chart below the green line represents the slope of weighted linear regressions for pay and tsr compensation percentile pay 100 75 50 25 0 0 compensation vs total shareholder return tsr researched company 25 50 75 100 performance percentile tsr source redeye equity research if the ceo s cash compensation over the last five years exceeds the tsr in relation to the company s peers this check is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for people and is included as additional information to assist with investment decision making nore am aware of the shortfalls of tsr but no performance measure is perfect and many are open to manipulation my view is that tsr is least manipulable over the longer term and will take into account operational performance importantly it is the measure that most aligns company performance with shareholder returns and this is ultimately how all companies will be measured over longer time hori zons keep in mind that current performance is the result from efforts made many years ago this suggests that we might measure the previous ceo s performance rather than the current office holder since nowadays the average tenure of ceos tends to be shorter than five years proxy guide compensation basics xecutive pay disclosure is typically toward the middle of the annual report whereas incentive plans can be found in press releases unfortunately it can be hard to find information regarding compensation in the annual report as the requirements of disclosure are typically simplified for smaller companies base salary is just cash paid regularly during the year not directly linked to individual or company performance measures bonus means variable compensation and includes one time payouts and or performance based payouts non equity incentive compen sation tied explicitly to a company or individual performance plan one time payouts includes hiring or signing on bonuses special awards severance and any number of other payouts these are usually cash payments and can often be deferred check the footnotes in the company s annual accounts not in this book for specifics pension is counted as part of a given year s pay and the amounts the executive will get in the future equity based compensation are essentially estimates the true value will fluctuate over time with the company s stock price or other factors the amounts reported are calculated by more or less uniform methods according to ifrs2 as of the date that the awards are made to the executive stock awards include ordinary shares of company stock but more commonly restricted stock or restricted stock units as well as any performance shares phantom stock or a variety of other similar instruments they re all alike in that the value is essentially the stock price multiplied by the number of shares or units the executive gets the ultimate value will fluctuate with the company s stock price option awards includes stock options but also less familiar instruments like stock appreciation rights these are all similar in that the ultimate value to the executive depends on the difference between the share price when he or she receives the awards and the share price when he or she cashes them in often years later the value shown in the tables often reflects an estimate or projection generally calculated with complex but widely used option valuation formulas non equity incentive compensation includes a variety of cash payouts tied to the company s or individual s performance the most common is the annual incentive bonus sometimes called defined contribution benefits but many companies also have long term incen tive plans based on three or five years of company performance all other compensation is just that a catch all for special benefits and perks from souped up life insurance and discounted sports tick ets to free jet rides or even company subsidized home renovations total is the sum of the other columns as the name suggests note that pay is reported for the year in which it s earned so a bonus for performance in 2020 shows up in the 2020 line even if it will be paid out early in the following year by contrast the amounts are calculated at the time of the award the value of equity based pay can fluctuate after that point ownership strength analysis does the company have strong and capable ownership ompanies are much stronger when they have the right shareholders ownership structure is a key function for the company de velopment and longevity if a company has one or more dominant owners it is usually more important to have a favourable view of those involved than to know everything there is to know about management particularly beware companies that flaunt celebrities as partners or investors typically companies with vague ownership structures have ended up in difficulties that can be traced to weak governance such owner less companies are employee governed which allows management to pursue its own agenda without regard to what is best for the com pany and its owners ownership strength checklist 1 does the company have a large outside shareholder on the board 2 does the management team own a significant stake in the business 3 does the company have a controlling owner with long term ambitions 4 is the founder still involved in the business 5 are the principal shareholders interests aligned with those of minority shareholders 6 does the company have classes of stock with different voting rights 1 does the company have a large outside shareholder on the board why does it matter quite simply the risk that management will act in its own interest increases if the owners are absent the presence of a large non manage ment shareholder on the board of directors typically means better performance such companies are generally better governed pay their executives more rationally and the stock typically outperform companies that have no such principal minding the business even if the threat of takeovers and hedge fund activism can have a healthy disciplinary effect on managers the cost of these efforts is so high that they will always be rare most institutional investors simply lack the motivation and the time to effectively discipline or other wise oversee management how to assess it examine the shareholder list for large shareholders a large shareholder is defined for the purpose of this rating as a shareholder that owns 5 or more of a company while an outside shareholder is a shareholder who is a non management shareholder companies that flaunt celebrities as directors or investors should be approached cautiously asarule institutional capital prefers to vote with its feet and sell its holdings rather than voice its objections but institutional owners can be an important complement to principal shareholders and small shareholders when they hold a substantial stake they can act as a governance watchdog and provide a stamp of approval for the company from the investor perspective this is an effort that takes place primarily in nominating committees but also through dialogues with the company alongside the nomination process if there is anon management shareholder on the board of directors with ownership of at least 5 the stock is scored one point 2 does the management team own a significant stake in the business why does it matter companies are generally more likely to prosper when management has a meaningful ownership stake a high insider ownership is prob ably the best protection against fraud it ensures that they think primarily as owners not as employees typically a management team with sizable equity ownership retain a long term perspective for the company resulting in more prudent operational and capital alloca tion decisions as they are more likely to explore every alternative before considering a dilutive equity offering as nassim taleb points out in his book skin in the game what matters isn t what a person has or doesn t have it is what he or she is afraid of losing one thing you can generally count on is that managers will behave despite what they say in a way that maximises their own wealth if the stake is too small ownership becomes more of a symbolic gesture then pay and bonuses play a bigger role than their shareholding in how they can personally make or lose money on the company s performance managers that own little or no stock in their company make decisions differently than if they owned a significant stake this difference may manifest itself in extravagant office furniture lavish hotels and fancy business cards it s the difference between careless spending and conservative budgeting in other words a management team that doesn t own the business rents the business they use it how they want and treat capital discipline and shareholders as an afterthought because their own money isn t at stake how to assess it the key is that the managers own enough to care and to shun those companies in which managers are in a position to free ride off share holders without putting any of their own capital at risk of course the bigger the company the less significant each person s holdings are a good complementary sign is if the mangers view frugality as a source of pride the company headquarters can send the message that each buck counts as it ultimately belongs to the shareholders if management as a group owns 5 or more of equity or a majority of senior managers own shares with a value of five times or more their base salary the stock is scored one point unvested shares in incentive arrangements should not count towards the total nore while high insider ownership can mean that incentives are aligned to shareholders benefit in some situations it may also become a deterrent for institutional shareholder participation since they will find it difficult to trade large quantities of stock also a limited float makes management immune to potential shareholder action while a lot of money managers won t invest in such companies due to liq uidity issues it can be your edge 3 does the company have a controlling owner with long term commitment why does it matter this check evaluates if the company is backed by financially strong investors with long term commitment to the business having a cash rich promoter family or parent company that can and will back long term initiatives with cash and provide additional capital during pe riods of stress is a good sign moreover academics have found that stocks of companies with controlling shareholders including families outperform those with dispersed ownership controlling owners typically avoid excessive leverage and use retained earnings rather than serial equity offerings to grow also inde pendent thinking is easier in companies with dominant shareholders these features insulate against pressure from both rivals and stock markets as they typically focus on long term value creation ideally the controlling owners are active with board positions and deep experience in some aspect of the market maybe they have worked with these same customers in another context or they have deep expertise with the technology or they have built a very similar business in an adjacent market how to assess it carefully examine the controlling owners objectives for the company their finances and their dealings so that you can know as far as possible what lies ahead a controlling owner is defined for the purpose of this rating as a shareholder or group of shareholders a family for example that controls at least 20 of the company s board seats with a minimum of two and has done so for a period of more than three years acontrolling shareholder at imminent risk of high indebtedness and who may be forced to sell its holdings is not a stable owner this also applies to owners who lack the financial muscle to back up long term initiatives with cash when no one else will in both cases the owner ship structure is at risk of being undermined beware those companies where the major owners don t support growth by not investing in a new issue a related red flag is if the control ling owners treat the company asa cash cow and don t support sound growth initiatives if the company has controlling owners with a long term commitment to the business the stock is scored one point 4 is the founder still involved in the business why does it matter this check evaluates if the company still has founder influence we consider it a significant positive for a company if its founder or their family remain significant owners or are still active in the business he or she helped to establish the founder s skin in the game demon strates their faith in the business and ensures their interest in the company s long term success also founder owned companies gener ally outperform the market founder ownership creates long term focus companies where the founder still has long term ownership ambitions typically act genera tional in their capital allocation perspective such companies also tend to be more committed to the development of their employees how to assess it examine the shareholder list for the presence of a founder a founder is defined for the purpose of this rating as the person who estab lished the company but could also be a descendant of the founder s or a refounder who has reshaped the business through some sort of crisis in other words a founder or an entrepreneur is not always someone who creates a new venture it is also someone who shifts a busi ness from low to high productivity if the re founder or their family still owns at least 10 of the outstanding shares and or is still involved in a managerial position or as chairman of the board the stock is scored one point 5 are the principal shareholders interests aligned with those of minority shareholders why does it matter strong owners are not always good for the stock or for other shareholders one apparent explanation for an owner discount is that the principal shareholder has or can be suspected of having interests other than maximising the value of the company i e that power is more important than return if the principal shareholder considers the company its own there is a great risk that minority shareholders will be ignored you should be extra observant of companies with a second class of stock with super voting rights large family or insider ownership or large government ownership positions any of these can have a meaningful impact on executive decisions on capital allocation another obvious case where the principal shareholder s interests diverge from those of other shareholders are companies where the prin cipal shareholder is looking to take over the company entirely how to assess it ask yourself if the principal shareholders interests have led to value destructive decisions a bad sign is if the company s major or con trolling owners have a poor reputation associated with unethical behaviour or profit previously reaped at the expense of minority owners you will find opinion pieces by searching for phrases like company name fraud another example is found in companies dominated by a founding family in which there is reason to suspect that the family retaining con trol is an end in itself this is particularly true in cases where family members are perceived as shoe ins for key positions in the company even though they are not qualified for these jobs similarly a controlling founder may make nepotistic hires of people they are most com fortable working with instead of better qualified candidates short termism sometimes applies to venture capital companies despite their commitment to active ownership their work with portfolio companies is exit driven and temporary with the goal of divesting their investments within the foreseeable future usually 5 10 years uncertainty always ensues when an owner that clearly wants to exit does not have an obvious successor which often has a negative im pact on venture capital owned companies in the lead up to an ipo the same sometimes applies to spin off companies if the company s major shareholders interests are aligned with those of minority shareholders the stock is scored one point 6 does the company have classes of stock with different voting rights why does it matter the risk here is that the company will focus on keeping insiders happy at the expense of common shareholders issuing shares with mul tiple voting rights allows the founders and management to maintain control over the strategic direction of the company which increases the risk that management may pursue projects that are not in the best interests of the company but for their own benefit in turn this may imply a higher cost of capital on future fund raising dual class shares help the founders and management focus on the long term growth of the company instead of immediate financial return they can also be seen to be a tool to defend against unwanted takeover attempts as the controlling parties can vote down takeover proposals by exercising their voting power how to address it examine the shareholder list for the presence of dual class shares with different voting rights that confer extra power on insiders if the company has dual class shares with different voting rights this check is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for people and is included as additional information to assist with investment decision making board leadership analysis does the board of directors appear to be objective and effective structural constraints outstanding ceos do not need a lot of coaching from owners although they can benefit from a similarly t he best solution to corporate governance issues is to take great care in identifying ceos who will perform capably regardless of high calibre board that is well suited to the company and independently minded finding and retain a talented ceo is of outmost importance for directors but the role of the board is not just to hire but also to fire the ceo that s why a sensible analysis of the board focuses on the question if it became necessary would the board have the wherewithal to op pose or even fire the ceo governance is necessary but it is not sufficient directors must also be chosen for being business savvy their interest and their ability to represent the owners interests in the end the board s primary function is to advise the management team on achieving sustainable long term performance therefore directors must assume the role of mentor not governor one of the greatest problems among boards is that members are selected for other reasons such as adding diversity or prominence toa board such board members typically view their directorship as a perk not a responsibility board leadership checklist 1 isa majority of the board composed of genuinely independent directors 2 does the board hold regular meetings without the ceo to review his or her performance 3 is the size of the board reasonable 4 do most board directors appear business savvy and shareholder oriented 5 is the company free of abuses of power for personal gain 6 does the chairman serve on an excessive number of outside boards 1 is a majority of the board composed of genuinely independent directors why does it matter the proportion of independent directors on a board is viewed by many as critical to firm performance this question addresses whether members of the board are subject to control by others generally a board lacking a majority of independent members will raise significant concerns the largest frauds in corporate history have typically involved board members whose interests were more clearly aligned with management than shareholders independent members of the board are less apt to be yes men directors with ties to management may be less willing or able to effectively evaluate and scrutinize company strategy and performance furthermore boards without adequate independence from management may have other inherent conflicts of interest also there needs to be a balance between board refreshment board stability and the importance of some long tenured directors toa company s success governance is only one part of a director s role and concern about extended board tenures and a preference for board refreshment can do more harm than good see note below therefore director tenure is an issue that is best left to boards to address individually how to assess it look out for conflicts of interests between board members and the ceo found in the related party section of the proxy statement also ask the ceo how each of the directors came to the company the latter should be accompanied by checking up the board members that have come to the business during the ceo s tenure typically the ceo plays an important role in bringing board members in if all of the directors were brought to the company by the ceo it s fair to ask the ceo how confident an investor should be of the board s capacity to monitor their performance independently one of the principal roles of all boards for redeye to determine whether an appointed director is independent under our standards the following minimum criteria for the di rector are required 1 no fees received from the company committee consulting or board are more than 20 in relation to their annual income 2 no previous employment at the company 3 no family relationships with the company s executives or directors 4 no transactions between the director the director s employer or the director s immediate family member s current employer and the company in the last fiscal year if more than 50 of the board members are considered independent the stock is scored one point note typically listing standards state that for a director to be independent no or only a minor share of ownership is allowed nor should the director have any relationship to a significant shareholder warren buffett mentioned that jesus understood this calibration of inde pendence far more than most institutions matthew 6 21 observes for where your treasure is there will your heart be also we stick to buffett s biblical standard when it comes to independence and ownership we believe that a meaningful level of share ownership is a good sign but not necessary for independence similarly the least independent directors tend to be those who receive an important fraction of their annual income from fees they receive for board service and who also hope as well to be recommended for election to other boards and thereby to boost their income further yet these are the very board members most often classed as independent while pay should be sufficient to attract high calibre individu als directors with disproportionately high fees are deemed not independent by our standards another issue with listing standards is long tenured directors when a company limits a competent director s term it limits his or her opportunity to learn and acquire relevant expertise to contribute to more than just governing directors need to provide long term strate gic guidance to management by coaching and nurturing talent the prospect of investing a huge amount of time to learn the business and win management s trust and respect is daunting for most directors this is a long journey and it would be unwise to kick them out after they ve served for several years after all companies don t fire high performance employees on their tenth anniversary moreover if the board is composed of members with prestige political figures close friends consultants or lawyers this may indicate that the ceo is bringing in people loyal to him or her and is not running the business with shareholders interests in mind however there may be good reasons behind such choices so be sure to do further investigation to find out for example a challenging regulatory climate might be a good reason to have a lawyer at the table 2 does the board hold regular meetings without the ceo to review his or her performance why does it matter all ceos should be measured according to a set of performance standards yet the ceo s performance is harder to measure than that of most workers a terrible manager is a lot easier to confront or remove than a mediocre manager akey problem in all governance structures is that evaluation of ceos is never conducted in regular meetings in the absence of that chief executive holding regular meetings without the ceo to review his or her performance can produce marked improvements in corporate governance if there are concerns the board should try to help develop the ceo unless it becomes objectively clear that he or she cannot do the job and must be replaced how to assess it contact the chairman of the board or the remuneration committee and ask if they hold regular annual meetings without the ceo and directors who are members of management to review his or her performance try to verify this by checking up meeting attendance at the remuneration committee in the annual report ask the ceo how confident an investor should be that the board is suitably independent to monitor his or her performance and what performance standards he or she is being measured on the latter should be set by the board s outside directors and tailored to the particu lar business and corporate culture but stress fundamental baselines such as returns on shareholder capital and steady progress in market value per share likewise ask if the board also has a contingency plan that is updated regularly and is ready to be put into action at short notice this typically includes meetings without the ceo to discuss who would be called on to serve as acting ceo in the event of the current ceo be coming unable to function for any reason if the board holds regular meetings without the ceo to review his or her performance the stock is scored one point 3 is the size of the board reasonable why does it matter board size is an important factor in board performance because the effectiveness of each director is strongly influenced by the number of other directors with whom each director must interact boards must be small enough to promote timely discussion and efficient decision making but also large enough to gain sufficient input and encourage debate a board that is too small or too large tends to be easy for man agement to control a director on a board with too many members will find it very difficult to participate in the full board s leadership process and outcomes which includes intense listening thought provoking questioning and insightful comments and perspectives also larger boards typically lead to less candid discussion of managerial performance and to greater control by the ceo a director on a board with too few members will experience isolation limited input interaction with a narrow field of vision and pressure to reduce his or her independence moreover the board may be too tightly knit to have diverse perspectives and if the board is composed of an even number of directors it will have more trouble reaching consensus how to assess it at least five directors are needed to effectively staff the standing committees required in regulated markets the audit compensation and nominating governance committees but more than nine directors would be too many if the board has five to nine members excluding members of executive management the stock is scored one point 4 do most board directors appear business savvy and shareholder oriented why does it matter many investors view the board of directors calibre as a proxy for the company s quality the validation that comes with respected board members means other investors are far more likely to consider investing in the business but great directors are rare directors need to be big picture strategic thinkers with thought and principles guiding their actions not rules they typically exhibit strong business acumen and are most likely professional high performers themselves business savvy directors often improve company performance by acting as respected mentors for the management team they help where they can and when they can t they make introductions to the right resources another important aspect of a board is shareholder orientation directors will be most inclined to look out for shareholders interests when they are shareholders themselves the higher the stake the more passionate the stewardship such directors are committed to cre ating long term value conversely a lack of business savvy and shareholder orientated directors can result in terribly over priced acquisitions strategy blunders and hiring mistakes how to assess it look for directors who are business savvy and shareholder oriented and arrive with a strong specific interest in the company warren buffett has often noted the advantage that companies gain from this kind of director to determine whether each board member is a good fit according to these standards you should review all directors professional background and speak with them in person if possible whether a board director is considered business savvy or not depends on whether they have a very successful capital allocation and or operational track record the former includes deep experience of the capital markets and fund raising but primarily involves a great track record of long term investing the latter means that they have helped as a director manager or major shareholder build or maintain a successful business over an extended period while providing superior returns to owners the key here is that the director understands what constitutes a high quality business this is an absolute necessity not only must board members be business savvy but they must also be shareholder oriented it is desirable that they hold sizeable personal stakes in companies they serve above and beyond board compensation so that they truly walk in the owners shoes these holdings should not be acquired via options or grants after all a good reason why someone should consider joining a company s board is to invest a significant portion of their net worth and be able to watch it closely lastly a willingness to make a significant equity investment in the company should be considered confirmation of a strong interest in the company this typically means that directors are willing to commit their time and work hard they take board meetings very seriously check board attendance as it indicates whether they are fulfilling their obligation to represent shareholders and provide management with oversight and direction attendance of less than 80 of all board and committee meetings over the last couple of years would sug gest further investigation is needed if more than 50 of the board members are considered business savvy and shareholder oriented the stock is scored one point note ideally a director has professional experience directly related to the company s business either as an entrepreneur or as an executive or director in a high performing company at the same time however it is important to recognise that some of the best ideas insights and contributions can come from directors whose professional experiences are not directly related to the company s business 5 is the company free of abuses of power for personal gain why does it matter if the board members or senior executives are using their positions to enrich themselves friends or relatives it can bring their integrity into question for example if any supplier is related to the board of directors or management it is possible that they might not be receiving the best price for the goods or services this conflict of interest could be hurting the bottom line some related party transactions can actually be good for business that is not to say we should ignore this but rather recognise the need for careful assessment of the people you entrust with your money but beware situations that could lead to conflicts of interest it could be any board or management team member that previously has done something self serving that appears dumb how to assess it doa search for the term related party in the annual report and read the paragraphs the key here is to make sure that the company isn t sending a significant amount of business to related parties also watch out for any flagrant pattern of abuse of power where insiders treat the company as their piggy bank a warning sign should also be assigned if the company doesn t disclose information on related party transactions or if it faces legal challenges one of the worst kinds of related party transactions is money lent to insiders to purchase company stock another bad one is when the ceo owns the building and leases it back to the company if the company is devoid of any abuse of power for personal gain the stock is scored one point 6 does the chairman serve on an excessive number of outside boards why does it matter as for other non executives but even more so for the chairman of the board holding multiple outside board positions and other commit ments may represent an impediment to the director s ability to devote sufficient time to the needs of each company how to assess it in this check we consider over boarding we look at the total number of board seats including the company held by the chairman to determine if it s excessive defined as more than four public company board seats and a maximum of two chairman positions moreover as a chairman they should not hold an executive position in order to maintain appropriate focus and not be distracted by competing responsibilities if the chairman serves on more than four public company board seats including the company and holds more than two chairman posi tions this check is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for people and is included

and don t have a clear sense of how the business will engage customers create value and consistently deliver that value at a profit you won t succeed as an investor the key is to identify the factors that will pro duce future earnings and be able to make a reliable forecast of them considering these factors in depth is much more valuable than reading the most recent quarterly report the most common source for uncovering potential growth drivers is the annual report through it you can gain an overview of the com pany s core business understand how it makes money and assess which drivers kept the business growing over the past few years it also reveals future expansion plans it is also wise to read competitors annual reports to gain a more nuanced view of the market the framework the business rating is based on quantitative scores grouped into six sub categories business scalability market structure value proposi tion competitive moat operational risks and social responsibility all of these sub categories are assessed on five checks of quantitative and qualitative questions each check is allocated one point if the question can be answered with a yes the total number of these points makes up each sub category s score on a scale that ranges from 0 to 5 rounded to the nearest whole number if unsure about a question or disclosure is inadequate the check fails by default this is consistent with the best ideas often being the simplest each sub category also includes a sixth complementary check these negative questions provide additional information to assist with investment decision making but have no impact on the scoring model business scalability analysis is the business model repeatable and scalable important way in which rapid and sustained growth can take place businesses with high scalability grow with lower capital requirements making them more efficient and more attractive to investors scaling simply means that the business has the potential to multiply revenue with minimal incremental cost w hen businesses are highly successful one of the common key ingredients is scalability a scalable business model is the most look for a business model that shows the path to growth and profits very clearly be sure to understand what they do and how they plan to succeed the more certain you can be of future cash flows the higher premium you will put on a business and as a result you will see a higher valuation ahigh margin recurring revenues and low capital requirements lead to stable and predictable free cash flows moreover subscriptions are generally more predictable and reliable and as a result create more investor confidence leading to higher multiples and more valuable businesses avoid business models that are difficult to decode be wary of management teams that imply that their superior intelligence overcompen sates for the complexity of their business models opaque business models are often an invitation to a scandal or shareholder lawsuit if you can t understand how a business makes money then you should stay away it s really important to focus on easy to scale because that enables fast to scale business scalability

which hasn t yet proven its business model 1 are a major portion of existing or potential revenues recurring why does it matter ahigh degree of recurring revenues increases the stability of a business and the predictability of its cash flows businesses with multiple sources of recurring revenue almost always have big premiums to their valuation multiples because of their predictability how to assess it find out if the majority of the company s existing or potential revenues are predictable and recurring look for business models that sup port long term annuity like revenue streams with the following characteristics 1 repeatable offering based on long term contracted revenues like subscription training maintenance leasing or license fees 2 repeat use of the product based on short repurchase cycles like aftermarket sales disposables for example or products bought out of habit the first characteristic means the customer is renting the product not owning it the second means that the product is consumed daily or weekly by customers and will need to be purchased again quickly no matter how the economy is doing nonetheless not all recurring revenues are equal the biggest potential issue is if the customer is being charged based on usage or trans actions which could deviate significantly it s very important to understand the quality and volatility of the recurring revenue and the difference between annuity income streams and lumpy revenues for example software companies can sell a one time license that includes the first year of support after that the customer often pays about 20 of the license as part of a recurring maintenance revenue but software can also be sold as a subscription in which both the license and maintenance fees are embedded into the subscription fee such subscription businesses take longer to grow than traditional software businesses but once they reach scale investors put premium multiples on their more predictable future revenue streams this is particularly true for automatic renewals of evergreen subscriptions like software maintenance or phone service as these often continue through inertia rather than by contract if more than 50 of the company s existing or potential revenues appear to be recurring the stock is scored one point 2 does the company have strategic alliances that can help drive its total sales why does it matter this check evaluates whether the company has a strategic partner that adds real value to its product offering the main objective of strategic alliances is to sharpen competitive edge in relation to other companies and as such they can add value to the customer relation ship that increase the stickiness of those relationships teaming up with others adds complementary resources and capabilities enabling participants to grow and expand more quickly and efficiently especially fast growing companies rely heavily on alliances to extend their technical and operational resources in the process they save time and boost productivity by not having to develop their own from scratch they are thus freed to concentrate on innovation and their core business how to assess it evaluate if the company has a strategic alliance partnership technology licensing agreement or joint venture that strengthens the offer ing by adding value recognizable to its customers hence it must strengthen the offering s value proposition to customers if the company has a strategic partner that adds real value to its offering the stock is scored one point 3 is the business asset light and able to scale up without expensive reinvestment why does it matter this check evaluates if the company is able to finance its growth itself more precisely it examines whether it is asset light as this enables it to expand faster more easily and on a larger scale such companies can generate more cash while growing and due to low capital invest ment there is no need for borrowing and the overall business risk is much lower moreover a low asset base leads to lower volatility in earnings and is simpler to value so is generally valued more highly than an asset heavy business ideally a company doesn t own much of the physical assets instead it makes use of other companies investments for its own benefit it may outsource some of the production and or services license in and out through strategic alliances and asset share usually it has devel oped a single product that it can sell to a lot of customers with few incremental costs the very best businesses often find a way to leverage someone else s capital expenditures for free the upfront cost of connecting people to the web for example typically such companies leverage technology substantially to provide their business with rapid scalability sig nificant efficiencies and great profitability if large capital investments are required to manufacture products or to provide services the business is capital intensive it requires constant funding and a lot more to grow which will either dilute shareholders through additional equity raises or use up earned cash examples of capital intensive industries are automobile manufacturing airlines steel production oil production and refining and chem icals production how to assess it anasset light business model is one that requires little capital for operations and expansion two common turnover ratios to use in your assessment of whether a business is asset light are sales to working capital and sales to fixed assets working capital turnover serves as a good measure of operating efficiency the higher the working capital turnover the less money a company has tied up to achieve its sales working capital is simply the money needed to keep oiling the wheels of the business if the working capital turnover ratio is 5 or higher it is considered asset light but the best companies actually have negative working capital it is common to see negative working capital in subscription based business models where customers pay up for recurring service or access because revenue is recognized when the service is performed which is after the cash comes in these businesses typically have operating cash flow that exceeds net profit likewise turnover of fixed assets property plant and equipment or ppe is a good proxy for a company s capital intensity companies with low capital intensity typically have small fixed asset bases resulting in a high turnover ratio above 5 as it implies a relatively modest physical asset base for example if a typical manufacturing business wants to grow it will require significant capital investments in new factories machinery and trucks however what you should be looking for is a scalable business that makes money based on intangible assets such as brand name intellectual property or developed technology as turnover ratios typically fluctuate from year to year look at the average over five years to get an accurate picture if the business appears asset light and able to scale up without expensive reinvestment the stock is scored one point 4 is strategy focused on organic growth why does it matter ideally you want a growth strategy that is more dependent on organic margin improvement initiatives than market share gains by fre netic acquisition activity as a growth by acquisition strategy makes the company more difficult to understand typically organic growth or same store growth is long term in nature whereas growth by acquisitions gives companies incremental gains in the shorter term the advantage of the organic route of growth is a consistency in the growth path a lack of turbulence and the ability to chart and structure the company s future activities agrowth by acquisition strategy involves more complex accounting that can more easily conceal problems in addition each acqui typically ends up being bigger than the last increasing the price and therefore the level of risk another issue with acquisitions is that integrating excessive purchases can be distracting for management and disruptive to the acquirer s core business as it often tends to dilute the culture the classic example of this pitfall is coca cola in the 1980s which allocated proceeds from the core business into acquiring columbia studios before refocusing a few years later however serial acquirers are a different breed of companies than companies that make large transformative deals for more please see check 4 in the capital allocation checklist although acquisitions can be entirely reasonable the experience of most companies across the world shows that organic growth is gen erally the wiser choice when it comes to building up a business but once critical mass is achieved a successful acquisition can help that company grow further and increase the core business s competitive advantage how to assess it managers should always describe the strategy that will shape the company s future it should be easy to find along with its key assump tions on its homepage and annual reports keep in mind that high levels of capital spending and rapid increases in market share are often tell tale signs of a deal mania and a management racing out of control if there is a strategy to mainly grow the business under its own power the stock is scored one point 5 does the company have a history of successful expansion into new markets or locations why does it matter expansion stories are great they show that the company has a business model that works and can be adapted to different geographies or locations past success with geographic expansion can be a good indicator of future success geographic expansion is one of the most challenging strategies for any businesses to implement where failed attempts are legion and can prove damaging to the original franchise products that work well in the home market do not necessarily translate to success in anew market but have to be reformulated to appeal to this market how to assess it look for companies that have proven that they are capable of successfully replicating their success by exporting their competitive advan tages into new geographical areas or multiple locations such companies have typically proved that they have reliable infrastructure in place to scale and match the rate of growth in demand advantages that derive from a unique distribution system localised scale advantages or favourable regulatory treatment may not be replicated abroad adaptability is often the result of considerable trial and error and takes time indeed companies that rely on unique business structures for competitive advantage at home will face the greatest difficulty expanding geographically if the company has a history of successful expansion into new markets the stock is scored one point 6 is this a pre revenue company which hasn t yet proven its business model why does it matter there is a major difference between a pre and post revenue company and this huge leap is often not fully captured in the increase in valuation from the former to the latter stage getting a customer to actually pay for something is a major milestone an indication that the company is building a product that a customer in its target market finds valuable before that first sale is made it s all just speculation how to assess it look at the income statement to determine whether the company has product sales i e a proven product or established market fit beware any one time payments related to licensing etc as they are not product sales if this company hasn t yet proven its business model this check is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for business and is included as additional information to assist with invest ment decision making market structure analysis does the business operate in a favourable market structure try dynamics have been substantially unchanged and competition relatively rational over many years are more likely to remain that way the greater the number of rivals the easier it is for new competitors to enter the market and the more rapidly technol ogy changes the more difficult it is to sustain success a ssessing a company s market structure is essential as it is a major factor that affects its future profitability markets where indus similarly slow growing markets are generally preferable as they don t attract competitors history support this as many of the best per forming investments are found in shrinking and slower growing industries but only if the business has lots of room for expansion with a differentiated and often disruptive product all the same it s challenging to achieve predictable growth when the pie is shrinking even if the company is the leader and taking market share in terms of industry structure an oligopoly is preferred to a fragmented competitive landscape that means market conditions with just a few competitors where all are highly profitable and protected by strong barriers to entry and scaling this translates into a stable market with few new players nothing lasts forever and change is the only thing you can count on yet many investors fail to think carefully enough about competition and obsolescence as they typically confuse novelty with disruptive innovation but where there is disruption there s also opportunity therefore it s critical to keep an eye on the major innovation trends of the future market structure checklist 1 does the business have a long runway for growth 2 does the business operate in a highly profitable industry 3 does the business operate in a slow changing market with long product cycles 4 does the business have limited competition 5 is the business resilient in the face of new innovations 6 does the company make an exciting product or operate in a sexy industry 1 does the business have a long runway for growth why does it matter this check assesses whether the company has products with sufficient market potential to enable substantial increases in sales over a decade at least a company seeking a sustained period of growth needs to have plenty of room to continue reinvesting capital both organ ically and through acquisitions for years into the future developing insights about a company s growth potential is clearly critical for predictability how to assess it look for an end market that is primed for an indefinite period of growth ahead instead of focusing on next quarter or next year the key is to step back and envision how big this company can be in a decade or two what you are looking for is the certainty that the company has the ability to grow consistently for many years to come preferably decades often this means that the company has products that address large and growing markets rather than shrinking ones with substantial over capacity think about the runway left and total addressable market often referred to as tam for a company the lower the degree of market pene tration the greater the remaining growth potential for a company don t just project growth rates from the past into the future as very few companies can keep growing for decades that s why you should try to assess if the company s product pipeline has good sales potential compared to existing products to extend growth after its current products have matured what is often missed is positive optionality you should always be thinking about the company s current products optionality for other markets revenue streams that are yet to be tapped think of how amazon has transformed from a bookseller to the all encompassing re tailer that it is today as well as a leading cloud services company to find out if the company benefits from positive optionality you should ask yourself two questions what can the company become and what does its current business make possible it could be substantial scope of geographic expansion extensions in terms of product range potential to increase penetration of its product potential to gain market share opportunity to consolidate an industry through acquisitions etc if the company is competing in a completely new market try to estimate market size and adoption rates for this new market also try to understand the impact from current megatrends profound changes in economic conditions that occur over the long term as these play a critical role in how large a market can become and how quickly however always be cautious if management s definition of tam is overly broad as they may be trying to mislead investors similarly you should be wary if a company that claims to have a long runway begins shifting into new or different markets the company should pri marily be selling more of the same product while producing consistent unit economics yet many businesses start with a bang but are ina market that lacks a big runway if it s possible to imagine the company at five times the scale it currently operates at in a decade from now the stock is scored one point of course this level of conviction is very rare but it is an essential ingredient for compounders 2 does the business operate in a highly profitable industry why does it matter this check measures the attractiveness of the industry in which a company operates a large part of your potential rate of return over the long term is attributable to the industry you are invested in as opposed to a specific company you are invested in this criterion helps you to determine which companies are in the most promising industries for you as an investor the profitability of a business typically trends toward the mean of the industry as it is difficult for any business to outperform the indus try for along period of time any business can earn above average return for a while but competition eventually compels most businesses to pass the savings along to consumers likewise it takes a truly exceptional business to buck a trend of challenging conditions how to assess it in order to assess whether the business operates in a highly profitable industry check whether the industry s 10 year median roic is greater than 15 to refine expectations you could dig down to more refined sub industry groupings if it s easy to make money in an industry you will find that most companies are doing well and the best businesses are not far from the worst in terms of return on invested capital roic indirectly a high roic for the relevant industry will also answer if the company s strat egy and those of its rivals are more focused on profitability than market share however be careful when buying into an industry with excess capacity since overcapacity is normally equated with negative or below average roic similarly you should be cautious if the management tend to talk about their peers in disrespectful terms if the language used is dismissive or aggressive the risk of mutually destructive behaviour increases if the 10 year median roic for the relevant industry is greater than 15 the stock is scored one point 3 does the business operate in a slow changing market with long product cycles why does it matter this check indicates whether the company operates in a slow changing market as consistent products equate to consistent profits some businesses have significantly longer life spans than others due to the nature of their products companies whose products have long prod uct cycles that last for more than a decade don t have to continually invent new technologies and keep competing with new generations of products or more precisely they are more adaptable because they have more time to see and react to change many investing mistakes arise from illusions of predictability which are especially acute in a rapidly changing industry a short product cycle means that it is much easier for a new player to come in and do better so sustaining market leadership in industries marked by fast paced innovation is extremely challenging companies that are resilient to technological innovation are becoming increasingly harder to find as technology impacts more and more industries in fast changing markets companies must stay flexible and keep an eye on the needs of the constantly evolving markets they operate in any competitive advantage has to come from a corporate culture the ability to constantly come up with new or improved products rather than the products themselves nonetheless at some point companies that must change constantly are destined to make wrong decisions and succumb how to assess it it is consistency in the product that creates consistency in the company profits look for opportunities where time is an ally not an enemy if you think that the company will continue to sell the same or similar products for the next 10 years then the business is considered as operating in a slow changing market with long product cycles typically you will see a gradual product improvement over time that dis courage competitors from entering a good complementary sign is if the industry market shares have remained stable with few new players in the last five years as market share volatility is a sign of weak entry and or scaling barriers think of the smartphone market apple never produced phones when blackberry was the king of the smartphone market in 2009 blackberry was producing incredibly high returns on invested capital of around 40 but just five years later blackberry was a completely different business with different products than it was in 2009 the bottom line is that you should avoid companies that are dependent on evolving technology adoption along with a hypercompetitive marketplace as obsolescence risk is high if you judge that the company will continue to sell the same or similar products for the next 10 years the stock is scored one point 4 does the business have limited competition why does it matter competition always exists but does not increase the value of a business generally more competition means more customer choice and less profitability in addition a business with limited competition is more predictable than one that has lots of competitors everyone has competition even those companies that are disrupting a market even so some competition is acceptable because com petitors help educate the market competitors presence can also legitimise and reduce the perceived risk of a new product category and attract enabling services and technologies how to assess it to understand the nature of the competitive landscape check whether companies have a history of co existing peacefully with each other making the industry highly profitable overall as a result this is most likely to exist if there are only a few companies that talk about each other in respectful terms a great sign is if the industry is consolidated to just a handful of players of various sizes with entirely different value propositions for customers as a result all diverge away from competing on common ground likewise any sign of capacity leaving the industry is likely to be highly positive for future returns if you can list the company s competitors by name it is considered to have limited competition and the stock is scored one point 5 is the business resilient in the face of new innovations why does it matter beware companies operating in areas at the leading edge of technology when it comes to competition it is key to think not about where the company is competing but where it is going to be competing this is particularly important in industries where the pace of technolog ical change is very fast like healthcare and technology achange in market or industry structure is a major opportunity for innovation technological changes driving market alterations are often more serious than they initially seem large dominant producers and suppliers having been successful and unchallenged for many years tend to be arrogant and slow to respond at first they dismiss the newcomer as insignificant and indeed amateurish but even when the newcomer takes a larger and larger share of their business they typically find it hard to mobilize themselves for counteraction the bottom line is that companies in industries that have changed rapidly survive only if they keep renewing themselves at a fast pace they either get research priorities right or competition leaves them in the dust think nokia versus apple how to assess it alllisted companies around the world must provide commentary about their performance and outlook on a regular basis there you ll find clues about where they see threats coming from from there you can dig further to discover the emerging players in their market and how they get a piece of the action in order to understand the threat from new innovations it s important to understand that very meaningful competition can come not only from similar products but also doing it an entirely different way or even not doing it at all try to escape the present and project some of the more obvious new behaviours and technologies farther out into the future new enabling technologies are often leading indicators of where the next great wave of innovation can be created as most technological advances are widely applicable to many problems and markets moreover the biggest opportunity for dis ruption typically is in markets where you see a lot of advertising as it signals that existing players can t rely on product differentiation in general the industries that have proven the most vulnerable to disruption have been those with one or a few major players relatively outdated business practices slow technology adoption always ask yourself if a bigger company apple or amazon for example can easily harness this opportunity and steal market share away often by offering free products for example dozens of businesses were eaten by the smartphone with its sensors always on connectiv ity and powerfully flexible user interfaces never forget that the value proposition for any technology is to do more with less in business being superb and easy to use matters more than being first technology almost always moves quickly but changes in cus tomer behaviour almost never do until they reach a critical tipping point look for signs of new technologies that foster product improve ments and whether there has been a shift to horizontal markets from an industry organized vertically don t confuse novelty with disruptive innovation the former is more a question of great features added in an attempt to differentiate whereas real innovation redefines the market as it changes the way the world works typically it transforms complex and expensive products by deploying new technology or business model to make them easier cheaper or more convenient this happens in part because the disruptor accepts lower margins and pursues a specific piece of the value chain that incumbents neglected and in part because the innovation does not fit into the incumbents established way of making money preventing them from commercialising it disruptive in novation simply is reinvention that is industry altering services are generally less prone to disruption through obsolescence as they are typically competing on a local geographical scale while products tend to compete on a global basis similarly companies with sophisticated or complex products are more likely to fend off com petition for a longer time as the technical challenge of replicating products creates high barriers to entry moreover such companies prob ably possess technological expertise that can be applied to next generation products protection from competition is particularly strong with companies that require both hard engineering and operational knowledge to scale if the market is safe from new competing technology or innovations that threaten the business the stock is scored one point nore keep in mind that great innovations tend to follow patterns face similar growth rates obstacles to growth and so on cars at first had no highways and gas stations telegraphs had no poles and wires the internet had no broadband try to learn by studying how the great entrepreneurs dealt with such challenges how technology evolved and how they got disrupted in turn by newer ideas 6 does the company make an exciting product or operate in a sexy industry why does it matter the market typically pays an entertainment tax or a premium for stocks with an exciting story it s easy to invest in dreams people often look for excitement when investing in the stock market but that s not where the money typically is this may seem counter intuitive but a boring industry is good it doesn t attract attention and this ability to keep out of sight of potential competitors is an advantage a sort of security by obscurity this relative obscurity can offer a layer of protection from competitive disruption as it generally won t be a hotly contested market envi ronment likewise such companies typically receive a lot less scrutiny from investors this makes fertile grounds for you to find unantic ipated growth at the end of the day you want a company that makes money more than one ina sexy industry on the other hand people may buy the stock because they believe its price can become detached from the fundamentals or economics of the business in these situations incremental earnings may be worth many times more for sexy products than if the company made some mundane product such story stocks typically carry a lot of volatility something that gives the opportunity to buy at low prices and sell at high prices the key to successful investing in story stocks is to discover them before the crowd does and they go viral attracting the momentum trading community how to assess it aboring product is typically the same as a simple to understand product the same goes for companies that operate in a boring sound ing industry such companies rarely make the business headlines and are likely to have lower price volatility also boring companies are often suppliers for others or sell everyday products that people continue to buy regardless of how the economy is doing if the company either makes an exciting product or operates in a sexy industry this check is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for business and is included as additional information to assist with invest ment decision making value proposition analysis do the products provide unique and desired benefits to customers ow badly customers want their product is a key driver of how profitable a company is as long as a company is valued by its customers its value will be retained providing a stand out product is the key to success which is the same as delivering a great customer value proposition the value proposition helps the company to differentiate itself from competitors and to focus on providing core value for customers for any company to succeed it has to be designed from the outside in based on what the customers really want and need rather than inside out based on strategic objectives and financial goals one of the main pitfalls in researching a business lies in viewing the business from your own perspective instead of viewing the business from the customer perspective your personal preferences are irrelevant to investing in the end from a shareholder perspective value is what the customers pay for acompany that lack a value proposition is just a commoditised business and will have to compete on price and price alone yet in many industries differentiation simply can t be made meaningful in such industries a company needs to race for cost leadership as commodity products tend to get priced by the marginal producer s cost of production value proposition checklist 1 does the company have a focused core group of customers 2 do the products solve a genuine customer need rather than create desire 3 are the products only modestly vulnerable to substitutes 4 does the company offer good value to its customers 5 does the development process take place in close co operation with paying customers 6 is constant heavy spending on marketing required for growth 1 does the company have a focused core group of customers why does it matter different customers typically have widely varying needs knowing who the core or target customers of the business are is key to gaining in depth understanding of a business their position and to monitor customer trends and how the business caters to them the more fo cused a customer group a company has the better it is able to appeal to those customers and manage for their loyalty many times it s just a small percentage of customers that represent a large percentage of the revenues for a business as a result acom pany s true market is typically limited to those customers for whom that purchase is a top buying priority the ideal customer as you go up in customer buying priorities you generally go down in market size since more people feel a problem generally than acutely focus taken to the extreme can easily put a company ina situation where it s building a product for a single unique customer in other words the probability of failure goes up exponentially as the number of product features increase how to assess it beware those businesses that attempt to cater to too many types of customers with the exact same product as there are no average customers instead make sure that the company has a clearly defined core target customer segment to identify the core customer ask management questions like if you could allocate more resources to one specific group who would it be which customers are the most loyal among which customers is the brand s recognition most widespread if core customers generate at least two thirds of a company s revenues which is twice as much as the rest of the company s operations combined the stock is scored one point nore keep in mind that customer need is a continuum and that the real difference between the need to have and nice to have customers is just a market size question and a question about buying priorities there are always more mainstream customers who will buy but view the product as nice to have rather than need to have as the company moves beyond early adopters into mainstream markets the company must adjust and reposition its product offering again and again to meet the needs of an expanded market typically early adopters buy the core product but the mainstream is interested in offerings that meet a broader set of requirements that often demand complementary products the latter comes at the risk of losing focus as the company expands its product lines 2 do the products solve a genuine customer need rather than create desire why does it matter the best businesses are so good at solving problems for their customers that they become indispensable many new products serve a useful purpose but they don t change our lives or our productivity in a meaningful way there s simply no point in making a product that brings no real substantial value to customers consider the common everyday fidget spinner the low friction plastic toy that seemingly defies newton s laws they were wanted badly by many yet weren t great investments for their manufacturers in the long run the distinction is that a valuable company provides a product that is useful and will remain valued by its customers how to assess it you have to get into the mindset of a future buyer to understand how useful this new product will be or how well the product is plugged into the customer s value chain the key is to assess whether or not there is long term demand for the company s product products hold their primacy just so long as their quality remains high look for products that improve health enrich emotional life fulfill basic needs or is perceived as necessary but where customers can t or won t switch if the product is a default choice for most customers it s probably a need to have item the holy grail is a product that is lifestyle changing as it can achieve hockey stick earnings trajectory for at least a few years also when a product gives the consumer a competitive advantage it will usually see very rapid uptake as it becomes established as a new industry standard a great product market fit strongly tends to generate strong word of mouth if you are solving a real need in someone s life it s only natural that they will talk to other people about it however be cautious if the company s products are trend sensitive or taste dependent fashion flavours and fragrances for example as these are susceptible to shifting consumer preferences customer loyalty is best understood by customer feedback not by extrapolating past numbers this makes it harder to estimate revenues using only historical numbers ask what customers would do without the company s products if it was taken from them would that be a problem would their life be worse likewise it is easy to be misled by good acquisition numbers when it comes to digital products if the product has real value for customers you should see good engagement numbers and even better retention metrics top of funnel growth means nothing if the users churn merely selling a product doesn t automatically translate into customer success customer retention is a better indicator of future growth provided there is a consistent flow of new customers at an acceptable acquisition cost low churn will allow recurring revenues to grow improving the growth rate and reducing the risk of value loss over the long term a high churn rate has the opposite effects and can also signal to investors that the product does not meet the customer s needs adequately or sits in a market with limited demand or is compet ing with stronger products this would imply that it requires further development at their expense what churn rate is acceptable comes down in large part to which customer segment the business is targeting as a rule of thumb smaller customers tend to have higher churn rates also it s important to determine whether it s a technology which is not yet a product or a product feature or component supplier which may never become more than an add on for someone else s product or if it s providing a complete solution or product concept that a sub stantial company can be built around if the company s product is likely to be in high demané far into the future the stock is scored one point 3 are the products only modestly vulnerable to substitutes why does it matter customer perception is critical with effective differentiation a company minimizes the perception among consumers that its product has many close substitutes making products that offer proprietary content have patented or unmatched features or acquiring and adding value to such products is a starting point for differentiation in addition a perceived lack of substitutes raises switching costs that said the most devastating substitutes cost less and have at least one feature that is superior how to assess it try to assess whether the company s products are thought by its core customers to have no close substitutes the key to answering this question is to understand why customers buy the company s product and why they might stop buying it or switch to a competitor s product agreat way to learn interesting things about a company s product is to talk to the company s customers find out whether they are finding cheaper or simpler products that are good enough can a customer perform similar functions with a different or more integrated product that appeals to potential customers who do not want multiple devices or would they have to own multiple devices or platforms to per form all of the necessary functions or have a similar experience agood complementary question is whether existing customers will stay even if a competitor lowers its price remember the larger a corporate customer is the more objective its purchasing decisions larger companies typically focus more on direct cost savings and are less willing to pay for intangible or convenience benefits they typically use procurement departments that enhance rational behaviour in corporate buying if the company s products are thought by its customers to have no close substitute the stock is scored one point 4 does the company offer good value to its customers why does it matter quality in a product is not what the supplier puts in it s what the customer gets out and is willing to pay for a business that wants to cre ate value needs a unique and persuasive reason for its customers to buy often a marginal improvement on a marginal cost is not enough to drive buying behaviour in all but a tiny minority of power users likewise engineering doesn t always have the right answer because of the customer s subjective perception especially for mission critical products that are built on trust and reliability at the end of the day customers are the stakeholders who determine the fate of a business sometimes they are unwilling to pay a pre mium price for a product even if the less expensive alternative needs to be replaced or repaired frequently equally if customers are not satisfied with a product they will eventually find alternatives or another company will eventually create an alternative if one does not exist already how to assess it to convince customers to buy new products usually need to be several orders of magnitude better than the current state of the art there is alot of inertia in the good enough syndrome where people prefer the safe and familiar status quo moreover the best product isn t always competitive on price as customers buy for other reasons as well like cost and convenience or environmental concerns yet it must be affordable for broad market adoption that s why you should wait for a proof of customers willingness to pay up for a product which shows if it really offers them value at earlier stages accumulating a set of users who really loves it would be a great sign you should be highly concerned if a company seeks to extract as much value as possible from their customers in the attempt to maximize shareholder value in these situations customers will feel that they aren t getting good value sometimes they continue to pay because of limited competition or the company having some form of competitive advantage in that case the business is extracting value from rather than adding value to its customers this parasitic relationship could lead to customers feeling exploited if a competitor were to come up with a better alternative they would probably jump ship similarly some companies create complexity for their customers because it makes things easier for themselves complexity comes in many forms requiring customers to invest a lot of time learning how to use the product is one example other examples include requiring significant changes in their behaviour or making it difficult for them to switch to another provider or not being compatible with any products outside the selling company s own ecosystem the last of these means the less optionality a business provides its customers the less value the product will have for them in all cases you should be very cautious if the company s product makes life harder for many cus tomers as creating a sales success is likely to be difficult finally beware your own blind spots when you don t match the user archetype that the company s product is built for since your personal preferences are irrelevant always try talking to the company s customers to get a deep customer perspective if customers feel they get a good deal when they buy the company s products the stock is scored one point 5 does the development process take place in close co operation with paying customers why does it matter you need to make sure there s a real demand for the company s products when it comes to building products success requires intense dedication to help client companies achieve their goals and solve their needs an average company does not develop a deep enough un derstanding of customers present and future needs and wants companies like this are at risk of being blindsided by shifting customer demands a business with a strong value proposition ultimately manages to ask its customers what they feel about the product what they want to achieve and how they measure success and failure feelings and hidden motivations largely drive what we do but they don t come with explanations attached still most companies just ask customers what they want the bottom line is that competitiveness is far more about doing what customers value than doing what the company thinks it s good at the best companies generally find ways to consistently engage the consumer and incorporate them into their innovation and planning initiatives namely to spark ideas for improved or new products working closely with customers helps companies anticipate and meet or exceed their needs through data driven foresight knowing exactly what customers and the customers customer value enables a more effective development process by minimising both product risk and time to market how to assess it customer loyalty is best understood by customer feedback not by extrapolating past numbers has the company shown a willingness to adapt to feedback quickly understanding the psychology of the customers requires a huge concentrated effort and investment most companies have a financial fear factor that keeps them from doing what it takes they generally say that they work closely with their customers but as you read their annual reports and examine the annual reports of competitors or customers you will see the differ ence between those that do and those that do not look for companies where r d has become a collaborative effort with prototypes re finements and tailor made products such companies innovate around the needs of their customers itis critical to scrutinize whether management s claims about themselves align with what their customers think of them inability to understand how customers experience its products almost guarantees an eventual disconnect between the problems a business tries to solve and those customers need solving if the development process takes place in close co operation with paying customers the stock is scored one point 6 is constant heavy spending on marketing required for growth why does it matter a lot of products rely on heavy marketing to maintain their market share if the growth is not organic but pulled in by heavy marketing it is easy to be misled into thinking that the product is great when in fact it s just mediocre yet most companies use heavy marketing at the initial stage of the product life cycle to get customers but abuse of this could be mislead ing once the initial hype is over people might realize that they don t need the product this is usually the case when a strategy is based on a specific product rather than a real need amazon s founder jeff bezos once said more and more money will go into making a great customer experience and less will go into shouting about the service word of mouth is becoming more powerful if you offer a great service people find out how to assess it the only way to tell if it is a genuinely great product is to create growth that is more based on recommendations and word of mouth the latter often means that customers ask for the company s products by brand name try to think of it in terms of how easy it is to acquire and on board new customers i e the user acquisition cost ifa sales success depends on continuous heavy marketing to maintain their market share not just to encourage first timers to consume this check is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for business and is included as additional information to assist with invest ment decision making competitive moat analysis is this a defensible business that can stay competitive ompanies are born with potential to be great but we cannot know how they will do until they are tested yet profits attract com petitors and competition makes it difficult for companies to generate strong growth and margins over the long term in the end defensibility is what will define the success of the business and make it attractive though many investors are easily misled into focusing only on the rate of growth instead of trying to evaluate whether the business can earn excess returns in the long run the longevity of growth a company without defensibility is basically producing a commodity and typically has little to compete on be sides price the best businesses are protected by some sort of durable competitive advantage that gives them longer term viability of the business such companies can charge much more for its products than it costs to produce them and can do it for many many years they do some thing special that is not easily replicable by competitors as competitors eventually erode such advantages simply put businesses with durable competitive advantages have built in shock absorbers all moats disappear over time but great businesses have the longest shelf life durable competitive advantages also called competitive moats are typically other than expensive capital superior technology specialised knowledge required to start up a similar business or being the first to start doing business in a new market as they all tend to be tem porary such advantages can begin to look like monopolies and yield huge but short term profits before the competition has caught up similarly higher profitability that comes from lower costs and product improvements will not lead to sustainable value creation without durable competitive advantages what does return on invested capital mean return on invested capital roic measures the return that an investment generates for those who have provided capital and how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its core business a high roic is generated by a combination of re curring revenues high gross margins and low capital intensity as such roic is a proxy for the rate of compounding you could expect if a company were to retain its earnings and reinvest rather than paying them out as dividends return on invested capital is calculated as return on invested capital roic net operating profit after taxes invested capital where net operating profit after taxes nopat operating profit x 1 tax rate invested capital ic fixed assets non cash working capital non cash working capital current assets current liabilities cash cash equivalents it should be noted that this formula excludes goodwill and intangible assets as they are unrelated to the economics of the core business that doesn t mean that how much a company paid for past acquisitions doesn t matter just that it is not relevant to the calculation of the underlying business s roic competitive moat checklist 1 does the company enjoy market leadership 2 is the company s competitive position strengthening 3 do the company s returns on capital consistently exceed its cost of capital 4 does the business have a competitive moat that is easy to identify 5 does the company possess the ability to raise prices without losing customers 6 has the gross profit margin declined over the past three years 1 does the company enjoy market leadership why does it matter this check indicates whether the company enjoys market leadership as it highlights its ability to protect its turf something that will have a direct impact on its ability to grow and flourish market leadership puts the business in a strong position allowing it to drive the market and create barriers to entry or scale for potential competitors also competitors tend to focus on fighting weaker competitors while leaving the stronger ones alone how to assess it we consider a company a market leader if it is positioned to capture the greatest value in a growing market it is not necessarily the largest player by market share but rather the one that consistently outgrows its competitors and generates higher operating margins than them aniche market strategy typically means focusing on overlooked customer segments that high cost incumbents are unwilling or unable to focus on yet most great companies tend to start out focused on market leadership in a niche market and don t have the global leader ship ambitions if the company is in the top three in a global market or number one if it is a local operation or a small market niche the stock is scored one point if the company has no product sales yet it scores no points 2 is the company s competitive position strengthening why does it matter this check indicates whether the company is expected to have a growing market share for several years if the customers are happy with the company s offering it will be reflected in the market share the bottom line is that a true moat doesn t just retain and maintain its ex isting customer base it also attracts additional customers the greatest gains in a stock are usually made as a business is developing its competitive advantage rather than after it already has de veloped one this is typically manifested in a growing market share whereas a declining market share indicates the opposite problems with the product offering customer dissatisfaction and distribution challenges a business that is experiencing declining share is failing to attract new customers over time it will lose its competitive advantage as ex isting customers either end up switching to other products or just quit buying them how to assess it we consider it as positive if the company is set to grow its market share over the next five years or at least retain its market share if itis a market leader what we are looking for here is a proven ability to win market share a good proxy for market share growth is increasing acceptance and usage of the company s product this manifests itself in an increasing number of customers on the negative side market share weakens if the threat of competition increases the latter could be due to a shift in consumer demand based on patent expiration a new disruptive technology or business model by comparing the roic growth rate in absolute terms and relative to the growth experienced by its nearest competitor we can better un derstand whether the company s competitive position is strengthening or weakening if the business is set to grow market share over the next five years or at least retain its share if it is a market leader the stock is scored one point if the company has no product sales yet it scores no points 3 do the company s returns on capital consistently exceed its cost of capital why does it matter the good quantitative evidence of a moat is its ability to generate returns on capital that is greater than its cost of capital and a history of doing so over time this is the only way that growth adds any economic value there is simply no value created when return on capital is below opportunity cost in other words a company whose return on capital is significantly above its opportunity cost over time has a moat whether they know it or not how to assess it mathematical formulas won t tell you how to get a moat but they can help prove that you have one look for a return on invested capital roic that is higher than its weighted average cost of capital wacc over time in this question we examine whether this spread has en dured over the past three years if return on invested capital roic is significantly higher than weighted average cost of capital wacc over the past three years the stock is scored one point if the company has no product sales yet it scores no points 4 does the business have a competitive moat that is easy to identify why does it matter ifa company has some sort of moat that makes it resilient in the face of competition the likelihood that it can sustain high returns over a long period is higher many companies will have a few consecutive years where they hit the curve right and earn high returns on capital despite not having a durable moat accordingly it is important that you can identify the moat before paying up for growth how to assess it what determines whether a company has a competitive moat is both quantitative and qualitative this check serves to validate the qual itative side by trying to identify elements that makes competition nearly impossible for competitors factors that can hardly be copied even with deep pockets if you find these the company probably has a strong competitive moat a good question to start with is what features are common to the longest lasting businesses within this sector this question will help you to understand what moat sources exist and are most relevant in a certain sector there are only a handful of competitive advantages that we consider real and sustainable barriers to entry or moats the primarily quali tative sources of moats are a scale economies b special assets c process power d switching costs e network effects and f brand loyalty finally keep in mind that not all moats are global they may only constitute a local structural competitive advantage for more about moats see proxy guide competitive moats if the business has a sustainable competitive advantage that is easy to identify and protects at least 50 of future earnings the stock is scored one point 5 does the company possess the ability to raise prices without losing customers why does it matter the existence of a sustainable competitive advantage or moat will typically be demonstrated by a company s pricing power or consumer willingness to pay this is the company s ability to set its own prices rather than have the market dictate the prices the latter means that the price for the product is negotiated and the company must lower the price to keep the customer the legendary silicon valley investor marc andreessen once said raising prices is a great way to flesh out whether you actually have a moat if you do have a moat the customers will still buy the definition of a moat is the ability to charge more pricing power is the opportunity to raise prices in excess of inflation without fear of losing customers or being undercut by competitors this means that a business can raise prices in real terms without affecting unit volume to generate superior returns on capital nonethe less it is not an unlimited or unchecked ability to raise prices at any rate the business desires strong brands are a well known source of pricing power pharmaceuticals are another notable example of pricing power at least until patents expire how to assess it when assessing pricing power gross profit margin growth and consistently high gross profit margins relative to industry peers tend to indicate pricing power while volatility in these metrics suggests otherwise however don t rely too much on gross profits alone when comparing peers as different companies account for expenses differently michael shearn who is the author of the investment checklist highlights several key characteristics in pricing power 1 companies that have high customer retention rates 2 customers who have low price sensitivity or only spend a small percentage of their budget on the business s product 3 customers that have plenty of cash or highly profitable business models 4 customers where the quality of the product is more important than the price and a higher price is signalling higher quality also pay close attention when you see competitive industries undergoing rationalisations as soon as they are consolidated down to three players creating an oligopoly the pain may already be gone and rational pricing will typically follow consolidated industries generally create a sort of pent up pricing power that can be released in the form of real price increases the message here is that you may find real pricing power in businesses that for some reason have not raised prices for a long period of time finally to sustain pricing power the company needs to constantly improve the value it offers to the customer if it doesn t its customers may become reluctant to accept the price or product innovation allowing competitors to overtake or disrupt them however if the com pany remains at the forefront of innovation it should be able to increase prices in line with the added customer benefits the innovation generates hence when you look at pricing power you should always look at the company s growth strategy particularly if it keeps invest ing in its moat sources for more about moats see proxy guide competitive moats if the company has sustainable pricing power to increase prices above inflation without hurting unit volume then the stock is scored one point if the company has no product sales yet it scores no points 6 has the gross profit margin declined over the past three years why does it matter a declining gross margin is a warning sign if competition gets tough or a company loses its competitive advantage its gross margin usu ally declines when revenues drop and the cost of making the goods stays the same the gross margin will decline conversely gross margin growth over time is a good indicator of a company s ability to reduce costs or maintain price increases without losing customers i e achieving cost efficiency and or pricing power how to assess it if the gross profit margin is lower than three years ago this check is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for business and is included as additional information to assist with invest ment decision making proxy guide competitive moats ompetitive moats are a business capacity to maintain competitive advantages that preserve its long term profitability and mar ket share in the face of competition companies with competitive moats typically survive financially even if management talent does not deliver as expected or if they leave the business finding companies with genuine moats is not easy it takes time and re search however an extensive literature has emerged since warren buffett first introduced the concept we divide all moats on the basis of price or cost advantages the two main factors that define a company s profitability below six common competitive moats are described briefly cost advantages companies that enjoy cost structure advantages produce better quality at a lower price than the competition or just apply price pressure to knock them out this involves creating a product much cheaper both to make and supply scale economies generate economies of scale in production buying power and large distribution networks as per unit costs fall with increasing output creating a flywheel that accelerates as the business grows for example building software costs the same regardless of the number of people buying it relative size matters more than absolute size as it makes the cost of gaining share prohibitive even so economies of scale tend to dissipate when the market gets large enough special assets benefit from privileged access at attractive terms to certain assets or resources that can independently enhance value like patents ownership licenses government approvals proprietary technology superior business model strong distribution network or location geographical proximity as in cases like airports and mines these are all elements that competitors cannot access or match with out suffering a net economic loss for example if a company has a strong distribution network that reaches its customers effectively and efficiently it has a huge advantage over other competitors that lack such distribution also a company with a strong distribution moat will also be able to enter new areas to expand its total addressable market tam as its competitive advantage does not depend on a specific product but rather its ability to distribute any relevant product such companies typically leverage their strong distribution moats by distributing acquired products toa wider audience than what the originator companies could access themselves peter thiel puts this point well in his great book zero to one superior sales and distribution by itself can create a monopoly even with no product differentiation the converse is not true process rower depend on a series of chain linked core activities to provide a whole product which rivals cannot readily replicate or do by hiring away the people to gain success with process power each core activity must be performed well as they reinforce each other still it takes significant trial and error to get the needed reinforcing actions in place to make them deeply embedded inside the organisation price advantages companies that enjoy price advantages lock out competitors through high entry and scalability barriers to sustainably earn high profit margins this involves creating a product that is convenient emotionally appealing and very easy to use or simply high quality swirchinc costs make it cost more for customers to switch to an alternative supplier than to remain this means that first mover compa nies have the potential to enjoy high switching costs if they scale fast still this value can only be captured if a buyer purchases repeatedly or buys add on products note that switching costs come in many forms money time risk and inconvenience breaking good business re lationships for example sometimes the competitive advantage of a business is a result of very long product lifecycles associated with inability to exit from the initial investment leading to relatively insurmountable switching costs typically this happens when a business can embed itself in the customer s business processes in a way that it becomes prohibitive for the customer to switch in such cases if the supplier can generate substantial aftermarket revenues it will have endowed itself with a substantial competitive advantage network effects provide a product where every new user makes the product more valuable to all other users this is like scale economies but instead of reducing the producer s cost it increases the buyer s willingness to pay to be able to scale fast it s critical to get the product right early on as networks win only at scale and have a winner takes it all boundedness for example in a two sided network like an auction or a marketplace business more buyers showing up will attract more sellers and that in turn will attract more buyers once this positive cycle is in place it becomes nearly impossible to convince either buyer or seller to leave and join a new platform businesses such as ebay and airbnb have built up strong two sided networks over time different types of network effects are stronger or weaker than others and they each work differently learn more about them at www nfx com brand lovalty create a strong brand that will earn superior returns to those with no branding a strong brand means consistency and a promise to consumers who will prefer it over any other almost regardless of price or convenience and sometimes even if the product is substandard loyal customers are simply less tempted by other offers and incentives since it is the label not the product that bestows brand loyalty brands can create customer loyalty through one or both of these two routes reducing uncertainty as the customer attains peace of mind knowing that the product will be as just as expected this happens through a lower search costs as an informational advantage of being well known and or b good reputation to confer legitimacy eliciting good feelings about the product distinct from the objective value this happens when it signals status to express individuality however creating a strong brand typically takes a long investment runway with no assurance of success also counterfeiters with incon sistent offerings may undermine it efforts to copy another brand run the risk of trademark infringement actions with their related costs and uncertain outcomes finally branding is a non exclusive advantage which means that a competitor can target the same customers with an equally impactful brand prada louis vuitton and hermés for example operational risk analysis does the business have limited exposure to significant operational risks investment evaluations should start by measuring risk negative events speed bumps and glancing blows will occur even during the maturation of great companies it s your job to know the difference between a glancing blow and a knockout punch that could sink the business at the extreme are those businesses whose revenues depend on binary outcomes where either the company achieves major success or perishes completely biotech and e commerce companies are examples this is typically the case for companies where revenues come froma single product or title as these are typically one time in nature likewise the risk is high when revenues are tied to commodity prices such as oil and gas companies or when the businesses rely ona small number of large one off contracts the latter means the businesses could see earnings take a sharp downward tum if one contract is cancelled or even worse if future contracts become scarce in such businesses you re basically always operating in the dark and are restricted in making realistic forecasts understanding such risks are very important since growth and profitability could be highly unstable that s why you need to evaluate the operational risks to avoid being overly confident of a company s future prospects operational risk checklist 1 does the business have a wide revenue base 2 are the business s earnings largely unaffected by commodity prices 3 is the business relatively immune to regulatory risk 4 is the business independent of any major partners 5 is the business defensive and independent of market conditions 6 does the business depend on key employees for its future success 1 does the business have a wide revenue base why does it matter the ideal situation is a diversified customer base and wide geographic distribution with multiple sources of revenue where each product contributes significantly to profits in other words you want to avoid companies that sell only one product to one group of customers in one market ahigh dependence on a product or a small number of customers could lead to two potential disasters if the product goes away or is made obsolete or the customers find a new supplier it will leave a significant dent in the company s revenue likewise if the customer doesn t leave but has significant bargaining power it can reduce the company s revenue customers that repre sent a large percentage of the revenue simply have bargain power that is likely to result in pricing feature or service demands over time that s why companies with excessive customer concentration will generally attract a lower valuation multiple moreover although countries economies and markets have become more connected it does not follow that they are all in sync with each other at any time some may be experiencing strong growth while others are mired in recession how to assess it to determine whether a company has a wide revenue base the following three criteria are evaluated 1 no single customer accounts for more than 10 of sales 2 no single product accounts for more than 20 of sales 3 no single country accounts for more than 60 of sales if all three criteria are fulfilled the stock is scored one point 2 are the business s earnings largely unaffected by commodity prices why does it matter commodity prices are volatile and highly unpredictable as a result investing in companies where the revenues are tied to commodity prices is gambling to an extent as they are at the mercy of the market they are price takers the company s revenues profits and stocks will rise and fall in volatile fashion with the price of the commodity no one is able to accurately forecast the price of commodities over time this is why we find that most executive teams in these types of companies behave in a pro cyclical fashion in other words they take a lot of risk at the top of the cycle and are forced to make the wrong decisions at the bottom of the cycle by raising new capital etc how to assess it if the company s earnings aren t tied to commodity prices to a large extent the company s income is considered to be independent of com modity price changes if the company s earnings are largely unaffected by commodity prices the stock is scored one point 3 is the business relatively immune to regulatory risk why does it matter unexpected regulatory changes can send shockwaves around the markets and destroy companies accordingly it s a good idea to spend some time thinking about the regulatory risks that a company is exposed to given the arbitrary nature of many political decisions even the most expert analysts struggle to predict how a government s actions might impact a particular stock some companies receive their revenue from government sources either directly or indirectly but if the government is able to change the amount of revenue received due to budget changes for example the earnings of these companies whose products are subsidised by the government will always be at risk a reduction in this subsidy would increase the cost for consumers and subsequently reduce the demand likewise businesses regulated by the government are at risk of a change in laws and regulations as these can have a deep impact on pricing and operating costs or change the competitive landscape that s usually the case for pharma companies for example given the im portance of regulatory agencies in approving and reimbursing new drugs always factor in a high likelihood of negative aggressive regulation of business models that the government doesn t approve of like gambling or consumer loans corporate executives typically ignore these sorts of developments because it is just more convenient not to take in information that things might be changing yet it s entirely possible for companies to cease operations as a consequence of new regulations how to assess it if the company s revenues aren t heavily regulated or at risk of being targeted by regulation at some point in the future they are consid ered independent of regulations if the business is relatively immune to regulatory risk the stock is scored one point 4 is the business independent of any major partners why does it matter no one likes to be at the mercy of a partner investors will discount the valuation of any company that is heavily dependent on another partner today or in the future in some way suppliers may have a duopoly which weakens the company s ability to negotiate favourable purchase agreements this is typically the case when the company rely on a highly concentrated supplier base with little to no competi tion the bottom line is that strong dependencies eat away at investors simply because the company is exposed to issues that are out of the control of management and even if the partner doesn t impact them the mere awareness that they could can have a dramatic impact on long term valuation how to assess it if no single partner accounts for more than 20 of sales the company is considered to not be highly dependent on any major partner this includes any large license contract or patent expiry if the business is independent of any major partners the stock is scored one point 5 is the business defensive and independent of market conditions why does it matter an industry may be in a strong growth period and look very attractive but it may also be at the peak of a cycle that is possibly about to turn substantially negative a cyclical business will report the highest earnings at the top of a cycle right before income is about to de cline investors often fall for cyclical stocks exactly when their valuations start to imply strong growth far into the future people love extrapolation and forget that cycles exist yet many companies follow the cycle of the economy meaning that their perfor mance will be cyclical and relatively unpredictable when expansionary periods are sustained for surprisingly long time people begin to believe that cyclicality has been conquered and growth starts to look sustainable when it is not the best companies are those that do well when the economy is doing well and don t miss a beat when the economy falls into recession demand for their products is stable rather than cyclical which contributes to steady top line growth as a result companies that sell ne cessities rather than products that are merely desired are likely to do better in a recession in other words defensive stocks hold up much better than cyclical ones in market crises and recessions or at least rebound faster how to assess it if the business isn t cyclically fragile and can grow despite the overall economy the company s revenues are considered recession proof toa high degree such companies typically sell products that are necessities that address a very basic need for their customers instead cyclical stocks are those that correlate with the overall economy including luxury items and other discretionary spending try to under stand how the last recession hit the company also consider the extent to which its products are exposed to the cyclicality of its customers markets likewise companies that depend on access to capital markets to raise cash are indirectly dependent on the overall economy to grow their business accordingly companies that are highly dependent on market conditions should be considered cyclical if the business is neither in a market with cyclical demand nor is dependent on the capital markets the stock is scored one point nore companies that operate in defensive markets are not necessarily better investments than companies that operate in cyclical markets but at least management doesn t have to deal with the business cycle on top of everything else the key to successful investing in cyclical companies is to look for companies that are able to operate at low prices and with little debt if not the company may not make it out to the other side of the cycle this dictates that the company must have the ability to counteract lower revenues by lowering costs 6 does the business depend on key employees for its future success why does it matter companies with key employees are typically small businesses that depend heavily on just a handful of people who are essential to its business what happens if a key employee leaves becomes ill or dies if this has an outsized impact on the company s overall health it isa considerable operational risk this is certainly the case with founder led companies likewise employees in many service companies are effectively in control of their own business without necessarily being shareholders such service companies may earn high returns on capital but only because capital isn t needed this is typically the case for investment banks law firms fund managers consultancy companies and head hunters despite supposedly high returns on capital in these busi nesses the value creation may mostly benefit key employees as a result the opportunities to earn attractive returns in such companies are typically rather limited for external shareholders as the company is probably being run for the benefit of management and key employees how to assess it ask yourself if the business model depends on execution and requires considerable faith in key employees or is being run for insiders if the answer is yes this check is flagged likewise the check is flagged when the growth stalls because key employees aren t able to do what s right for the company and its investors this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for business and is included as additional information to assist with invest ment decision making social responsibility analysis does the business operate in a socially and environmentally responsible way ustainable profitability can only be achieved by treating stakeholders fairly in the same manner that buffett views reputation as a bottom line worthy of care equal to the profit margin so too is social wellbeing of all stakeholders according to this type of holistic thinking responsible businesses ought to track their triple bottom line their economic sociocultural and environmental per formance and in this way gain a sustained competitive advantage for their business environmental and social issues are hard to pin point but do ultimately impact the long term health of a business in short they require viewing treatment of workers communities and the environment as equal in importance to profit making they are about making prod ucts people need and doing so without hurting the planet asustainable corporate culture is critical to competitive capacity a business can benefit from pursuing sustainable development in two basic ways by driving cost efficiencies and by generating top line growth cost savings can come from better operational performance improved recruitment and retention of talented employees and lower business risk and improved safety increased revenue can come from learning and innovation enhanced recognition and reputation better customer loyalty improved supply chain management and access to capital the bottom line is that socially responsible investing improves returns and those who don t factor sustainability in will be at a disadvan tage social responsibility checklist 1 are the products for the greater good 2 has the company avoided sustainability related incidents over the past five years 3 does the company have a purpose driven leadership 4 do employees enjoy working for the company 5 are sustainability indicators incorporated into the incentive system 6 does the company lack disclosure on environmental and social issues 1 are the products for the greater good why does it matter many investors only want to invest in companies that operate responsibly and have a positive impact on the world these are not usually involved in tobacco alcohol pornography gambling weaponry abuse of human rights or environmental negatives like air and water pol lution fossil fuel companies for example the rationale is that if the product is for the greater good it is a net benefit to society that the company exists the greater good implies that companies contribute to a more circular economy they reduce environmental impact by more sustainable use of natural resources and a more responsible consumption or utilisation of assets leaving behind the old take make waste model the new frontier is re design re use repair to avoid unnecessary waste circular business models include opportunities for less volatile input costs that lead to higher margins this could involve remanufactur ing of a product into the same condition as a new product or production methods with lower dependence on raw materials it may also feature better efficiency and working capital management by changing the ownership concept from property to sharing how to assess it try to assess whether the company recognises revenue in an ethical and responsible manner you need to think of not just what it does but how it does it and what it uses sometimes an apparent failure on the greater good question is not necessarily the full story for example a company that makes submarines weapons that can cause mass destruction also helps keep the peace a second take re veals a company that contributes to a more secure world in which these products are used properly if the company s products make a positive impact on the world the stock is scored one point 2 has the company avoided sustainability related incidents over the past five years why does it matter today even the most socially and environmentally responsible brands can find themselves on the receiving end of heated activist cam paigns while isolated and smaller sustainability related environmental or ethical issues might not derail a business repeated incidents or a major one can tarnish a corporate reputation diminish trust and make a company more vulnerable to problems in the future how to assess it sustainability related incidents are any major environmental or ethical issues that could result in penalties or negative publicity with a significant long term business impact on the company google phrases like company name crisis or litigation and you will find opin ion pieces if the company has faced no major environmental or ethical issues or litigations over the last five years the stock is scored one point 3 does the company have a purpose driven leadership why does it matter whatever drives us we all derive happiness from finding purpose a corporate purpose is an expression of the change the company wants to bring about in the world as well as a unique approach or way that will bring it about purpose is a key element for any company to stay relevant in a fast changing world it represents something more than profits that should guide the company s operations a north star to follow in all major decisions it is also something that helps employees feel more person ally committed to the business the best performing businesses over the long term as measured by shareholder returns are very often purpose driven their ceos use purpose to generate sustained profitable growth stay relevant in a rapidly changing world and deepen ties with their stakeholders as pur pose creates a sense of community companies that survive are in essence communities that customers employees and owners want to be apart of astrong purpose help ceos redefine their market as they look for opportunities in the larger ecosystem rather than feeling limited to their current playing field also it allows them to reshape their value propositions by responding to trends building on trust and focusing on customer pain points this in turn enables them to overcome the challenges of slowing growth and declining profitability how to assess it purpose can be quite difficult to evaluate since even the worst companies will have some sort of generic mission statement that they pretend to believe in yet most companies were started because the founders were passionate about solving a problem idealists whose vi sion was about making the world better in some way not because they wanted to become wealthy look for companies whose managers and employees are passionate about the company s mission and want to do right by their stakehold ers ask managers why they do what they do what are their moral boundaries why do they exist beyond financial gain do their employ ees have that sense of purpose why do they come to work every day this reason for existing isn t meant to be a strategic differentiator but an aspirational goal that drives the organisation a good purpose should capture what a company aspires to be and do it is an ambition a cause something which the company and its customers can strive for together and something that makes the world a better place most importantly it has to be believed by most people in the organisation many companies consider purpose merely an add on to their strategy but a truly purpose driven company puts it at its core to determine whether a company has properly translated its purpose into action management need to answer yes to all of the following questions 1 does purpose contribute to increasing your company s growth and profitability today 2 does purpose significantly influence your strategic decisions and investment choices 3 does purpose shape your core value proposition 4 does purpose affect how you build and manage your organisational capabilities 5 is purpose on the agenda of your leadership team every time you meet additionally a company genuinely delivering on its purpose will typically have a passionate and loyal fan base even if this is a check the box exercise with management you should verify it by doing some background work with employees outside the management team see how to conduct your channel checks if the company has a well defined purpose and management answers yes to all five questions above the stock is scored one point 4 do employees enjoy working for the company why does it matter attracting and retaining talent is the most tangible benefits of a positive work environment after all one of the limiting factors for many companies is access to talent particularly in industries where the quality of ideas dictates success the ability to attract talent should not be underestimated most talented employees will gladly sacrifice pay for the right work environment when the employees of a business are excited to show up to work regardless of compensation that s when magic starts to happen if people are happy and feel good about coming to work they work more productively and tend to stay with a company much longer than unfulfilled employees long term employees provide better customer service due to their greater experience and knowledge and when customers receive more knowledgeable service they have a better experience and are more likely to do business with the company again also they are less price sensitive and generate positive word of mouth the bottom line is that happy employees lead to happy customers and happy customers ensure that shareholders are happy too employ ees with positive attitudes towards their work carry this over to customers and strive to deliver high quality service resulting in increased customer happiness and loyalty moreover employees who are happy and committed to their workplace genuinely want to see the com pany do well they are a vital asset in maintaining a strong reputation brand image and competitive advantage however all other things being equal employees at strongly performing companies will always be more satisfied how to assess it try to talk to some of the employees directly and visiting the headquarters it should be quite clear if employees enjoy working for the company look for a collegial and family oriented environment where best practices are shared and people are driven by the same overall desire to succeed in such a collaborative culture employees don t fear political retaliation or tolerate verbal abuse usually by high per formance employees both common signs of a broken culture these are typically companies that focus on performance indicators and where decisions are made as close to the customer as possible in a decentralised non bureaucratic process decentralised companies often have limited staff functions and organise themselves into small tight agile teams with considerable autonomy and earned trust business unit managers are typically given much control over their activ ities while pay is based on merit and performance likewise managers who pay attention to vision strategies culture and inspiration are often promoted rather than skilled mangers who are not necessarily leaders this in turn incentivises entrepreneurship and makes em ployees more likely to take responsibility consequently be very cautious towards arrogant imperial ceos who centralize power around themselves these ceos tend to have very little room for critique and if someone try to do anything innovative they are likely to be reprimanded my way or the highway leadership styles don t play well in today s world and will often result in a fractured culture and ultimately a non productive organisation people don t want to be micro managed and monitored every moment of every day nonetheless such organisations exist where no one is trusted to do their job how senior managers treat their employees is a good clue as to how they will treat their shareholders sir richard branson says train people well enough so they can leave treat them well enough so they don t want to management investing significant resources in employee training and contributing to employees well being is a great sign higher employee engagement typically follows when man agement promotes health and happiness through investment in employee wellness programs office architecture furnishings and high end technology and other corporate perks these are all worthwhile for frugal organisations that value long term outcomes as opposed to cheap managements that focus on minimising costs a good complementary sign is if the company s employee turnover rate is low compared to its closest competitors similarly a low level of sick leave among employees is a good sign looking at average salaries employee shareholdings and bonus plans can also give sense of how involved employees are particularly at professional services and similar companies another way to get a sense of employee happiness is to read reviews on glassdoor com although some are clearly fake the site gives de cent insight into employee sentiment at companies likewise a review of twitter and linkedin for people who work at the company may offer some unusual insights if employees enjoy working for the company the stock is scored one point 5 are sustainability indicators incorporated into the incentive system why does it matter the purpose of a company is not just to produce profits it is to produce solutions to problems of people and planet and in the process to produce profits that is why incentive plans should reward positive environmental or social impact alongside financial returns never underestimate the power of incentives incorporating sustainability considerations into the incentive system will highlight the integration of sustainability in daily work as a way of encouraging managers and employees to take a long term view for sustainable value creation this especially includes being proactive in identifying and acting on unethical behaviour that could damage the company s reputation it is important that success metrics are tangible challenging yet achievable and well communicated equally performance targets need to align clearly with reality and benefit all parties involved to ensure strong performance over the long term accordingly companies should explain and justify their pay arrangements in a meaningful way that is specific to the business and its strategy rather than through boilerplate generic statements how to assess it the right incentive system is key to driving results this means that senior executives compensation must be linked to the company s performance on environmental and social metrics look for remuneration and incentive structures that reward people for working to ward sustainable value creation keep in mind that incentive plans are not just about paying more money for better results they also can encourage managers to make the right choices that support the strategy and overall mission the answer to the question why do we exist and what do we contribute a well designed employee reward program is not about paying more to get better results it s about getting employees personally moti vated to meet company targets track kpis that are impacted by their performance and keep outperforming and prioritising sustainable returns however make sure that compensation is based on multiple metrics rather than just one no single metric can perfectly capture an under lying strategy as no single number tells the whole story moreover employees are far less likely to substitute a performance metric for the strategy itself when they have to meet targets on multiple metrics below are seven criteria listed that promote corporate sustainability 1 incentive plan that supports the strategic plan 2 clear correlation between company performance and payouts i e tracking multiple key performance indicators kpis that impact compensation 3 certain sustainability standards need to have been met before payout even if all financial targets have been met e g customer satisfaction or reduction in use of more hazardous chemicals 4 clawback provision for executive compensation where outstanding long term incentive awards are forfeited in the event of termination for cause 5 variable compensation spending is directly tied to company affordability metrics 6 no acceleration of long term award vesting upon retirement or any other form of termination 7 rewards are tied to multiyear business goals that can be valued annually based on objective performance metrics if incentive schemes check all seven sustainability criteria the stock is scored one point as with all performance measures these should be material to the business clear and transparent with specified metrics and targets that are measurable 6 does the company lack disclosure on key environmental and social issues why does it matter stakeholders increasingly demand that businesses create value for and not simply extract value from the communities in which they operate being a good corporate steward simply means going beyond having a community investment program or using recycled paper today climate change human rights legislation gender pay equality and marketing practices are just some of the potential risk factors re quiring disclosure by companies most companies acknowledge in their reports the importance of environmental and social issues but more often than notis this informa tion not clear enough in terms of significant environmental or social issues sustainability reporting should include clear metrics with a proper context this will help investors to gauge success over time in meeting these goals how to assess it the key is to assess whether the company discloses its exposure to and management of significant environmental and social issues that might impact its valuation a company that spends vast sums of money trying to address every conceivable issue is likely to see its finan cial performance suffer distinguishing between materiality and what s significant from a social point of view is key to effective sustain ability reporting for example greenhouse gas emissions are significant for an electric utility company but less so for a financial services company sim ilarly supply chain management is more significant for an apparel company using low cost workers in developing countries than for a pharmaceutical company if the company lacks disclosure on its exposure to and management of key environmental and social risks the check is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for business and is included as additional information to assist with invest ment decision making financial tenets does the business have solid financial fundamentals background nvesting is part art part science financial ratios make up most of the science ratios are used to evaluate the financial soundness of a business the analysis involves the calculation and comparison of ratios derived from a company s financial statements these ratios are key factors that will impact a company s financial performance and valuation however you only need a few to determine whether a company is financially strong or weak while ratio analysis is extremely useful and necessary for your investing it does have limitations financial ratios only look at past fig ures as such it is difficult to use them to forecast the future however ratios can give an indication of whether the trend is likely to persist or not and help you make better investment decisions even so for companies with a short business history it becomes trickier to do any meaningful analysis this is likely to lead to a lower score indicating a higher risk the purpose of the quality rating system the framework the financial rating is based on quantitative scores that are grouped into five separate categories earnings power profit margin growth rate financial health and earnings quality all of these sub categories are assessed on five checks of quantitative and qualitative questions each check is allocated one point if the question can be answered with a yes the total number of these points makes up each sub category s score on a scale that ranges from 0 to 5 rounded to the nearest whole number if unsure about a question or disclosure is inadequate the check fails by default this is consistent with the best ideas often being the simplest each sub category also includes a sixth complementary check these negative questions provide additional information to assist with investment decision making but do not impact the scoring model earnings power analysis does the company have strong earnings capacity earnings power reflects the ability of the stock to earn above average rates of return at above average growth rates return on assets roa and return on equity roe are the two most prevalent metrics used to obtain an idea of the returns a company generates and to compare this return generation to the company s peers while important information about a company s profit generat ing efficiency can be learned from each one of these two metrics they will likely each follow a similar trajectory t he earnings power of an investment should always be measured as terms of rate of return not as absolute earnings or dividends what does return on assets mean return on assets roa measures the productivity of the company s assets rather than measure net profit as a percentage of equity it uses assets used in generating earnings for the company it is a broad measure of the efficiency of asset usage by the company and is often used to compare if a company is more or less effectively using its assets than its industrial peers we use earnings before taxes ebt to remove the impact of taxation as companies operate in jurisdictions with different tax policies return on assets is calculated as return on assets roa earnings before taxes average total assets we use the average total assets for the period in question since a company s total assets can vary over time depending on purchases sales and seasonal fluctuations what does return on equity mean return on equity roe is the profit made as a percentage of shareholders equity it determines how efficient the company is at using both shareholder s capital and debt to produce income ahigher roe means a greater bang for every buck invested by shareholders but also that there is less need to borrow or sell more shares to grow the latter is because surplus funds can be invested to improve business operations if the return on equity is higher than the return on assets the business is generating higher returns for its shareholders than it is paying in interest in effect it is successfully leveraging borrowed funds we use average shareholder equity to calculate roe as shareholder equity in a company can fluctuate over the period during which the net income has been earned for instance dividends reduce shareholder equity and boost roe whereas a new share issue lowers roe the beginning and end of the period should coincide with the period during which net income is earned return on equity is calculated as return on equity net profit average shareholder equity book value if shareholders equity is negative the most common issue is excessive debt or inconsistent profitability however there are exceptions to that rule for companies that are profitable and have been using cash flow to buy back their own shares in all cases negative or extremely high roe levels should be considered a warning sign worth investigating earnings power checklist 1 has return on assets roa been consistently above the industry average 2 is return on equity roe higher than 10 3 has return on equity roe increased over the past three years 4 is average return on equity roe at least 20 for the past five years 5 has return on equity roe been consistent over the past seven years 6 does return on equity roe appear unsustainably high 1 has return on assets roa consistently been above the industry average why does it matter this check measures whether the company is better at using assets to generate profit than its competitors the best companies do well consistently showing discipline during boom years and taking advantage of opportunities during down years all other things being equal capital intensive companies where the business requires a large amount of capital to grow have lower roa than companies with lower capital requirements unless such companies have a superior asset turnover they are less interesting from the shareholder perspective because a larger portion of current cash flow is spent on maintenance investments expenditures they have to make just to keep the lights on how to assess it if roa is greater than the relevant industry average for every single year of the last five the stock is scored one point 2 is return on equity roe higher than 10 why does it matter this check offers a gauge of a company s earnings potential it indicates whether it s a profit machine or an inefficient clunker as acom pany cannot grow earnings faster than its current roe without raising additional funds public companies have historically earned a roe of 10 to 15 on average accordingly a company that achieves returns on equity of less than 10 has poor earnings power how to assess it if roe for the company for the last year is greater than 10 the stock is scored one point 3 has return on equity roe increased over the past three years why does it matter this check measures a company s profitability trend as there is a strong correlation between the stock performance and profitability over the long term an improving roe is a very good sign as it generally means that management has improved its ability to generate a profit this is most likely because net profit has increased in relation to common equity and a higher net profit is always a positive all other things being equal how to assess it if the last year roe is greater than 1x the roe from three years ago the stock is scored one point if no operating profit has been reported in any of the last three years or if the company has negative shareholders equity it scores no points 4 is average return on equity roe at least 20 for the past five years why does it matter this check offers a gauge of a company s earnings potential it indicates whether it s a profit machine or an inefficient clunker as a company cannot grow earnings faster than its current roe without raising additional funds it s generally accepted that a roe of 20 or higher is indicative of a company which is highly efficient however to grow at the current roe assumes all profits are reinvested back into the business very few companies can sustain 100 rein vestment rates at high returns for very long periods of time how to assess it if the average roe for the past five years is greater than 20 the stock is scored one point if no net profit has been reported in any of the last five years or if the company has negative shareholders equity it scores no points 5 has return on equity roe been consistent over the past seven years why does it matter this check measures if the company generates consistent and steady profits as it typically means increased predictability in future profitability a company can fake good roe for a couple of years but to achieve high roe for seven consecutive years is something else such a long time period will capture performance during different economic conditions and therefore can adequately measure consis tency of results how to assess it if there have been no annual drops in roe greater than 10 the relative measure not percentage points in the past seven years the stock is scored one point if no net profit has been reported in any of the last seven years or the company has negative shareholders equity it scores no points 6 does return on equity roe appear unsustainably high why does it matter this check indicates if roe is likely to be unsustainable over time due to the company s profitability earnings stability and leverage in short roe can be deceptive if viewed on its own indeed what has mattered historically for market beating share price performance is a company s ability to sustain a high roe over time it turns out there are a few tell tale signs of unsustainable roe s declining profitability non financial companies has operating cash flow to operating assets declined for three years ina row financial institutions has net interest margin declined for three years in a row 3 high variability in earnings all companies have there been annual drops in net profit of more than 20 in the past seven years c high financial leverage non financial companies is the debt to equity ratio 50 or higher financial institutions is assets to equity ratio 15x or higher if any of the three questions above is answered with a yes the company appears to have an unsustainable high roe and this check is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for financials and is included as additional information to assist with invest ment decision making profit margins analysis has the company generated high and consistent profit margins success an improvement in margins requires lower costs and or higher prices for the company s product steady growth in w hen it comes to evaluating a company s financial performance profit margin analysis is one of the key aspects in assessing profit margins over a number of years is a strong indication that the company is doing well acompany that is profitable will be able to pay its liabilities as they fall due profitable companies are also capable of distributing and grow dividends to investors however be careful not to take everything at face value it does not tell the whole story you still have to look into the reasons for the increase or decrease to get a clearer better and more accurate picture of the business profitability and overall financial performance what does gross profit margin mean gross profit margin is a financial metric used to assess a company s financial health and business model by revealing the proportion of money left over from revenues after accounting for the cost of goods sold cogs because it indicates how much money is available for innovation expansion and increasing sales it is vital that small businesses intending to grow show a high gross profit margin gross profit margin is calculated as gross profit margin revenue cogs revenue examples of cogs include labour directly tied to production depreciation of the manufacturing plant utilities of the facilities tied to production direct materials needed for the production of goods and services what does operating profit margin mean the operating margin is earnings before interest and taxes ebit as a percentage of revenue also known as ebit margin it is an indicator of acompany s operational profitability higher operating margin indicates either that the company controls its costs or that sales increase quicker than costs of the operation having a high operating margin also means the company tends to generate substantial free cash flow operating profit margin is calculated as operating profit margin operating profit revenue what does net profit margin mean this is the ratio of earnings left after all costs and expenses have been deducted from gross sales or gross receipts unlike the gross profit margin and the operating profit margin the net profit margin takes into account the taxes as well as finance costs it is essentially a re flection on how efficient the business is in using its resources in its operations and answers the question how much out of every buck in sales is a company actually earning net profit margin is calculated as net profit margin net profit revenue profit margins checklist 1 is gross profit margin higher than 50 2 is operating margin ebit above the industry average 3 has the average operating margin ebit been higher than 15 for the past three years 4 has operating margin ebit increased for three years in a row 5 has net profit margin been positive in the past 10 years 6 does the company have high operating leverage 1 is gross profit margin higher than 50 why does it matter this check indicates if the company has a profitable product mix that is in high demand a high gross margin is a sign of a business that can make a reasonable profit on sales as long as it keeps overhead costs in control the higher itis the more profits will accelerate with sales growth also a high gross margin allows the business to fund the investments out of their own cash flow for a start up it simply means that it will generate positive cash flow and profits when it does get to scale gross margins vary widely based on industry and different companies use different expenses but in general the higher the better none theless we want a company to have gross margins higher than 50 how to assess it if the normalised gross profit margin see note below is higher than 50 the stock is scored one point nore gross margins can be quite misleading for instance a company must often front lower margin implementation training costs to get a customer up and running accordingly a company that is doing gangbuster business may see a material decline in gross profit margin 2 is operating margin ebit above the industry average why does it matter this check indicates financial efficiency as it measures how efficiently a company manages expenses the operating margin is indepen dent of how the company is financed or taxed and is thus most suitable for profitability comparisons in general companies that can perform above their industry s average are doing something right and when margins are slim and tough times surface as they always do from time to time weak margin companies will probably start burning cash rather than generating it how to assess it if the past year s operating margin is higher than the relevant industry average the stock is scored one point 3 has the average operating margin ebit been higher than 15 for the past three years why does it matter this check is used to identify companies with decent profit margins by looking at the operating margin though the preferable range for operating margin depends on the industry we prefer a high operating margin as it leaves room for the business to stay profitable during bad times when a low profit margin business may fall into loss something that usually inflicts major punishment on its stock price how to assess it if the average operating margin for the past three years is higher than 15 the stock is scored one point if the operating margin is 15 or below or no operating profit has been reported for at least three years it scores no points 4 has operating margin ebit increased for three years in a row why does it matter this check is used as marginal incremental profitability over time indicates that the company is scaling nicely as profits are growing faster than revenue on the contrary eroding profit margins are a cause for concern companies that are increasing their profit margins while they grow can carry very high valuation multiples as future periods will have much higher earnings and free cash flow due to the cumulative effect of growth and increased profitability how to assess it if the past year s operating margin is positive and has increased for at least three years in a row the stock is scored one point if the margin is not increasing or no annual operating profits have been reported for each of the last three years it scores no points 5 has net profit margin been positive over the past 10 years why does it matter this check reflects the stability of earnings being more important than their absolute number companies that have generated profits in each of the past 10 years can be considered more predictable and robust demonstrating the ability to navigate recessions and industry slowdowns consequently old age is typically an asset as the longer a company has been around the longer it should last in the future all else equal we prefer to hold businesses that sell products with more stable demand however profit margins that fluctuate over a period of time are a tell tale indicator of a business that is prone to periodic price wars and or is highly cyclical where sales move up and down in line with the overall economy how to assess it if net profits have been reported for at least 10 consecutive years the stock is scored one point 6 does the company have high operating leverage why does it matter this check measures the company s operating risk as the sensitivity in operating profits ebit to its sales this is a good thing when sales are increasing but the process also works in reverse and will decimate profits when sales fall in economic downturns high operating leverage readily translates into rapidly deteriorating cash flows and difficulty meeting debt obligations essentially a high operating leverage says that a company has fixed costs and needs to keep making incremental profits or else it would risk making losses whereas a negative operating leverage ratio suggests inefficiencies in operations as expenses are accumulating faster than sales how to assess it if the last quarter year over year basis degree of operating leverage dol is greater than 2 this check is flagged degree of operating leverage is calculated as degree of operating leverage change in operating profit change in sales this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for financials and is included as additional information to assist with invest ment decision making financial institutions this analysis is used for financial institutions as they are different from other types of companies and have specific ratios to analyse profit margins such as net interest margin nim and efficiency ratio keep in mind that the main objective of financial institutions is to act as an intermediary between those who have funds and those who seek funds for running their business or for personal use the first two checks from the profit margin checks above check 1 and 2 are replaced with more specific ratios and criteria designed to suit financial institutions unique business operations what does net interest margin nim mean this banking metric is analogous to gross profit margin for non financial companies banking is unique in its use of this term because its gross profit margin considers how much the bank has to pay depositors and debt holders for deposits and debt bank liabilities and how much the bank earns from borrowers and investments assets moreover a bank s nim reflects its strategy as well as the business environment net interest margin is calculated as net interest margin interests earned on loans and investments total interest paid on deposits and debt what does efficiency ratio mean this is a standard banking metric that shows investors how effectively banks are managing non interest expenses for example it cap tures various aspects that translates into lower non interest expenses such as cheaper rental payments for premises and fewer bad credit problems this makes efficiency ratios important because improvement in them usually translates to improved profitability efficiency ratio is calculated as efficiency ratio non interest expenses revenue profit margins checklist financial institutions 1 is net interest margin nim above the industry average 2 is the efficiency ratio below 60 financial institutions 1 is net interest margin nim above the industry average why does it matter this check measures the difference between interest income generated and interest expenses unlike most other companies the bulk of a bank s income and expenses is created by interest since the bank funds a majority of its operations through customer deposits it pays out a large total amount in interest expense the majority of its revenue is derived from collecting interest on loans how to assess it to decide whether a financial institution is performing better or worse than the industry average compare institutions within the same country as there are substantial differences in this ratio between countries if the current year net interest margin is greater than the industry average the stock is scored one point financial institutions 2 is the efficiency ratio below 60 why does it matter this check indicates how good a financial institution is at using its assets to generate revenue as it measures the amount of non interest expense it takes to create a buck in revenue the ratio does not include interest expenses as these occur naturally when deposits grow however non interest expenses such as marketing or operational expenses can be controlled by the bank a decrease in the ratio equates to better expense performance so the lower the ratio the better being a low cost producer is a tremendous competitive advantage in an industry like banking hence there is a clear correlation between bank size and efficiency ratios how to assess it if the efficiency ratio is below 60 the stock is scored one point growth rates analysis does the company have a strong growth trend company but only if they have the same reinvestment capacity are earning the same rate of return on invested capital and as company that grows its revenues and earnings consistently and rapidly will be worth more than a volatile and slow growing t long as this rate of return is materially higher than the opportunity cost of capital ifa company s earnings bounce all over the place it s either in an extremely volatile industry or it s regularly getting attacked by competi tors however the growth rates usually shed light on how the company s operations are doing and how they are growing for example sales growth is a good representation of a company s ability to take market share and or participate in a growing industry and eps growth is an indication of a company s ability to increase earnings whether through better sales good control of expenses or a combina tion thereof it should be noted that the growth rate analysis is very specifically designed to be predictive rather than descriptive it is more focused on the near term growth trend as research shows that the historical long term growth rate is not very predictive of future stock returns growth tends to naturally slow down as a company gains size over time accordingly a high growth stock is essentially a description of a development stage in a company s life cycle what does revenue growth mean also referred as sales revenue is income that a company receives from its normal business activities usually from the sale of goods and services to customers revenue is often referred to as the top line due to its position at the very top of the income statement revenue growth is used to measure how fast a company s business is expanding the figure shows the annual rate of increase decrease in a company s revenue or sales growth typically based on either trailing 12 months or three years all things being equal stocks with higher revenue growth rates are generally more desirable than those with slower revenue growth rates a high growth rate indicates low satura tion and high demand whereas a negative rate could suggest that consumers are losing interest in the product genuine growth stocks grow revenues 10 or more annually with rising or high reinvestment rates of at least 20 however to justify paying up for growth investors need more than price leverage it takes high unit growth as well what does earnings growth mean the earnings growth rate is the percentage change in a company s earnings per share eps in a period as compared with the same period from the previous year earnings growth gives a good picture of a company s growth prospects all things being equal stocks with better growth prospects are more desirable than those with poorer growth rates what does retention ratio mean the retention ratio also called the plowback ratio is the proportion of earnings kept back in the business as retained earnings it refers to the percentage of net income that is retained to grow the business rather than being paid out as dividends without a steady reinvestment rate company growth would be completely dependent on financing from investors and creditors ina sense the retention ratio is the opposite of the payout ratio it shows how much money the company chooses to keep in its bank account whereas the payout ratio measures the percentage of profit paid out to shareholders as dividends the retention ratio increases retained earnings while the payout ratio decreases retained earnings retention ratio is calculated as retention ratio net profit dividends net profit growth rates checklist 1 is the annual retention ratio above 70 2 has annual growth rate in revenue been consistently above the industry average 3 is the annual growth rate in revenue above 15 4 is annual growth in earnings eps above 15 5 have earnings eps increased in each of the past five years 6 have earnings eps grown at an extreme rate over the last three years 1 is the annual retention ratio above 70 why does it matter this check indicates whether the company retain most of its profits to reinvest and grow the business a growth oriented company that aims to expand develop new products and move into new markets would be expected to retain most or all of its profits ahigh ratio doesn t necessarily mean the company is investing those funds back into its own business or other businesses at above average rate of return this is a more efficient way of compounding shareholders capital than paying out dividends a low rate typically coincides with a lack of reinvesting opportunities and consequently a slower revenue and earnings growth how to assess it if the average retention ratio over the last three years is above 70 the stock is scored one point if no net profit has been reported in any of the last three years it scores no points 2 has annual growth rate in revenue been consistently above the industry average why does it matter annual growth rates that are above the industry average growth rate indicates that the company is winning market share and on the other hand below the average figure means declining market share while long term market share gain isa strong sign of a quality com pany market share shifts are usually most pronounced during economic busts when times are tough look for the strongest players to come out of slowdowns with more share than the marginal players revenue per share is an important metric because it s unaffected by most one time items that can help or hurt earnings per share it also takes into account the effect of dilution from stock issuance as well as lower numbers of shares outstanding due to buybacks how to assess it if annual revenue growth adjusted for m a is greater than the relevant industry average in each of the last five years the stock is scored one point 3 is the annual growth rate in revenue above 15 why does it matter this check is used to identify growth companies by looking at the annual growth rate of its revenues revenue growth is a purer measure of growth as the number is more difficult to manipulate while a high growth rate indicates low saturation and high demand a negative rate could suggest that consumers are losing interest in the company s product how to assess it if compound annual growth in revenues over the last three years is greater than 15 the stock is scored one point if fewer than four years of revenues are available it scores no points the compound annual growth rate cagr formula is the following compound annual growth rate cagr of revenues current year s sales growth sales growth 3 years ago 8 1 3 1 4 is annual growth in earnings eps above 15 why does it matter this check is used to identify good growth companies by looking at the annual growth rate of earnings earnings growth indicates whether the company is able to grow its profitability which impacts the valuation of the company fundamentally yet growth stocks have finite lives typically five to 10 years very high growth rates are usually achieved by young companies and growth rates of mature compa nies are much more moderate how to assess it this growth rate is the compound annual growth rate of diluted normalised earnings per share over the last three years in the nor malised eps figure one off non recurring or exceptional items are subtracted from the reported eps figure to give a more accurate depic tion of the company s underlying profitability if compound annual growth in earnings per share over the last three years is greater than 15 the stock is scored one point if fewer than four years of positive earnings are available it scores no points the compound annual growth rate cagr formula is the following cagr of earning per share eps current year s eps growth eps growth 3 years ago 1 3 1 5 have earnings eps increased in each of the past five years why does it matter this check is used as stable growth in earnings per share eps year after year typically means higher predictability companies in cyclical industries may see their eps fluctuate wildly in good years and bad years all else equal we prefer to hold businesses that sell products with more stable demand these companies often have more within their control and produce steadier earnings growth how to assess it if the company hasn t suffered an eps loss or decline in any of the last five years the stock is scored one point 6 have earnings eps grown at an extreme rate over the last three years why does it matter this check is used to identify if a company is experiencing extreme earnings growth the destiny of any fast growing business is to expe rience a growth rate that eventually slows down in other words earnings growth is generally mean reverting over time growth stocks trajectory towards maturity normally lasts no more than five years typically because they lose their dominance only a handful manage to reign for more than a decade see note below investors systematically overvalue high growth companies as they generally expect too much of the future asa result the fastest growing companies often fail to live up to expectations and can witness the biggest earnings disappointments accordingly you should generally avoid the most aggressive growth companies as they are the most vulnerable to overvaluation multiple fade and competitive business pressures how to assess it if compound annual growth in earnings per share over the last three years is greater than 50 the stock is flagged the compound annual growth rate cagr formula is the following cagr of earnings per share eps current year s eps growth eps growth 3 years ago 1 3 1 this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model and is included as additional information to assist with investment decision making nore a company with rapidly growing sales and earnings can perform very well for a time despite seemingly higher valuations however sustaining high annual sales growth is extremely difficult as the law of large numbers naturally causes many companies to end their growth streak on average only one company in the s p500 was able to sustain 10 sales growth for 10 consecutive years between 1990 and 2015 financial health analysis is the company in good financial condition any investment mistakes can be traced to overlooking the company s financial position in particular the downside risks of debt or its sources debt can be seductive because even investors wary of excessive leverage can be deceived into stressing its upside more than its downside however debt can be the biggest enemy of investors as lenders always get paid before shareholders debt oriented mistakes are most likely during periods of economic expansion during prosperity even mediocre companies appear to perform exceptionally well through such frothy periods market valuations tend to be high and it can be tempting to compromise on issues such as leverage but it s the companies with solid balance sheets that can weather economic downturns make opportunistic acqui sitions waste less of their profit on debt interest absorb unexpected problems with ease and keep moving forward what does debt to equity ratio mean debt to equity is also known as the gearing ratio debt in this case usually refers to short and long term interest bearing debt such as bank loans the lower the ratio is the lower the risk of failure or bankruptcy a low debt indicates that the company s operations are financed internally through earnings from operations ideally the company will hold no debt but debt is generally a cheaper way to grow than through equity and allows growth beyond the capabilities of current cash inflows from operating activities debt to equity is calculated as debt to equity net debt total book value of shareholders equity what does interest coverage ratio mean the interest coverage ratio also known as times interest earned is used to determine how easily a company can pay interest on its outstanding debt relative to its operating profitability ebit a higher ratio means that the organization has sufficient buffer even after paying interest the earnings tax and interest figures are found on the income statement interest coverage ratio is calculated as interest coverage ratio ebit net interest expense what does cash flow from operations mean cash flow from operations cfo often called operating cash flow ocf tells you how much cash flow has been generated by the core operations of the business it excludes cash flows from investing and financing in order to focus on the cash flows for the ongoing op erations which will determine the long term success of the company in the long run cfo must be positive for the company to remain solvent cash flow from operations is calculated as cash flow from operations net income depreciation adjustments to net income changes in accounts receiv ables changes in liabilities changes in inventories changes in other operating activities what does free cash flow mean free cash flow fcf measures how much cash is left over to a company s investors after all necessary investments to sustain its oper ations such as investments in working capital and fixed capital including plant property and equipment otherwise known as capital expenditures plus any expenses required to remain a going concern we are here focusing on capital spending that merely sustains its business not capex that expands the business they are often lumped together so you need to separate them accordingly it involves judgement calls about the true level of maintenance spending fcf is an important measure because it allows a company to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value excess cash can ex pand production develop new products make acquisitions pay dividends and reduce debt conversely if fcf is negative a business burns through cash reserves and eventually needs to raise funds via debt new shares or asset sales in other words companies can t survive over the long term without generating fcf free cash flow is calculated as free cash flow cash flow from operations capital expenditures financial health checklist 1 are current assets 1 5 times greater than current liabilities 2 is total debt less than three times operating cash flow 3 is total debt less than 10 times free cash flow 4 is the debt to equity ratio below 50 5 is interest on debt covered more than five times by earnings ebit 6 does the company underspend on maintaining its assets 1 are current assets 1 5 times greater than current liabilities why does it matter this check measures whether the company has the ability to service its short term obligations or those due within one year from its cur rent assets cash inventory and any money coming into the company within 12 months how to assess it if the company s current assets are greater than 1 5x current liabilities the stock is scored one point 2 is total debt less than three times operating cash flow why does it matter this check debt ocf indicates whether in the event of financial stress the company is able to meet its debt obligations using its cash flow from its operating activities the total debt to ocf ratio simply shows how long it would take the company to pay back the debt if it stopped investing in its assets this can only happen for a couple of years for most companies before their assets become worn out and need to be replaced therefore with most companies you wouldn t really want to see a total debt to ocf ratio of more than 3 how to assess it if total debt to operating cash flow is less than 3 0 the stock is scored one point nore remember that debt levels on balance sheets are based on a snapshot on one particular day companies tend to present their year end balance sheets when they give the most favourable picture of their financial position average debt levels can be a lot higher through out the year one way of checking for this is to divide the cash interest paid figure in the cash flow statement with the total borrowings figure on the balance sheet if the percentage figure is a big number say more than 10 then average debt levels are probably higher than year end levels and the company has more debt than it is showing on its year end balance sheet 3 is total debt less than 10 times free cash flow why does it matter this check debt fcf indicates how many years it would take to repay all the company s debt with the current rate of free cash flow fcf it is producing the lower the number the better like all ratios it is best looked at over a number of years to see if it is normal for the company to have a high value or if it is a recent trend how to assess it if total debt to free cash flow is less than 10 0 the stock is scored one point 4 is the debt to equity ratio below 50 why does it matter the debt to equity ratio measures the amount of ownership in a company shareholders equity versus the amount of money owed to creditors total liabilities this ratio illustrates the level of leverage if the ratio is high this indicates that the company has a high level of debt compared to its net worth and in the event of financial stress may experience difficulty meeting debt or interest obligations in con trast a low ratio allows the company to continue meeting its financial obligations even when the economy is in a downturn how to assess it if debt to equity ratio is less than 50 the stock is scored one point note if the company belongs to a very cyclical industry more equity is needed for an optimum balance sheet construct moreover it s a bad sign if the ratio of debt to equity is rising and earnings are flat to down 5 is interest on debt covered more than five times by earnings ebit why does it matter this check indicates whether the company s interest obligations in the next five years are met through current year s earnings before interest and taxes ebit a ratio of five times earnings indicates an acceptable level of interest coverage it means that profits can fall by at least 40 before the ratio starts getting into the danger zone which is considered as interest cover of three or less also high levels of interest cover typically mean the company doesn t pay out too much in dividends but rather re invests earnings to compound growth over the long term how to assess it if ebit last twelve months is more than 5 x interest on debt the stock is scored one point 6 does the company underspend on maintaining its assets why does it matter this check is used to identify if a company is spending enough to maintain its existing assets and keep them in good condition in short it means that the company is spending less on capital expenditures capex than its depreciation and amortisation expenses for several years as a single year s capex might not be representative of normal spending typically capex items cover purchase of plants and production facilities equipment vehicles etc but may also include items such as money spent to purchase other companies or for research and development accordingly you should consider amortisation as the equiva lent of depreciation but for intangible assets sometimes you will come across a company where capex spending is considerably below the depreciation and amortisation expenses on a regular basis and it will not be a problem due to the nature of the business how to assess it you can tell if the company underspend to maintain its existing assets if the company is spending less on capital expenditures than its depreciation and amortisation ideally capital expenditures should exceed depreciation and amortisation expenses over time some companies will differentiate between capital expenditures needed for growth and capital expenditures needed to maintain the business yet they are often lumped together so you need to separate them by making judgement calls about the true level of mainte nance spending if the company is spending less on maintenance capex than its depreciation and amortisation expenses for the last year and the mainte nance capex to depreciation and amortisation ratio capex to d a is below its average over the last five years the stock is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for financials and is included as additional information to assist with invest ment decision making cash runway analysis this analysis is used for companies that have been loss making on average over the past three years an important factor to consider when analysing a loss making company is the sustainability of its operations at its current level of cash given that its revenues do not cover its costs for loss making companies the last three of the balance sheet checks above check 4 5 and 6 are replaced with more stringent and relevant criteria financial health checklist loss making companies 4 do cash and short term investments cover expected cash burn negative free cash flow for more than two years 5 is the company likely to become sustainably cash flow positive this or next year 6 does the company need to raise cash in the capital markets within 12 months loss making compantes 4 do cash and short term investments cover expected cash burn negative free cash flow for more than two years why does it matter this check indicates whether the company s cash and other liquid asset levels are sufficient to cover its negative free cash flow over the next two years this typically means that the company is liquid enough to withstand a market crisis and that it doesn t need to raise cash for at least a year how to assess it if net profit has been negative in at least two of the last three reported years and if coverage is sufficient cash and cash equivalents ex pected costs for the next two years the stock is scored one point loss making compantes 5 is the company likely to become sustainably cash flow positive this or next year why does it matter this check indicates whether the company is likely to achieve sustainably cash flow positive operations this or next year it means that the company is at an inflection point to be funded by its customers rather than investors this is the ultimate validation of the business model something that may attract new less speculative investors particularly if it offers high positive operating leverage how to assess it if net profit has been negative in at least two of the last three years and positive free cash flow is forecast for the current or next year and the following two years the stock is scored one point loss making compantes 6 does the company need to raise cash in the capital markets within 12 months why does it matter this check indicates whether there is high likelihood that management will be forced to raise additional funds within 12 months or less as they are running out of operating cash with such a short time frame it will likely require a deep discount ie potentially creating a bargain opportunity to get investors to fund the operating deficit nonetheless this suggests that you should stay away at least until the issue is solved as good companies should never find themselves running out of cash the bottom line is that if the company has to raise capital to meet its financing and operational needs oftentimes this capital is very expensive and dilutive to existing shareholders how to assess it if net profit has been negative in the last 12 months and net profit coverage is not sufficient for the next 12 months the stock is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for financials and is included as additional information to assist with invest ment decision making financial institutions this analysis is used in the case of banks financial service companies and insurance companies because their business model is different from others loans are an asset for a financial institution since they earn interest income from lending hence a financial institution is only as good as the quality of its loans the riskier the loan portfolio the greater the risk of loan defaults which jeopardizes long term profits for a financial institution considering that banking is a semi commodity business the industry suffers from skinny margins consequently fewer lending mistakes is critical as it means that less operating costs are tied up in collections work out personnel lawyer fees and loan officers whose attention is diverted from getting new businesses to overseeing the bad credit the bottom line is that the chief risk with investing in a financial institution is bad loans as not every loan an institution lends out will get repaid moreover considering the leverage involved a questionable leadership character of a financial institution poses a much higher risk than most other relatively unleveraged businesses since financial health is especially important for financial institutions there are several ratios to measure its ability to pay off its debts over the long term consequently you should use a checklist unique to financial institutions to assess if one is in good financial condition see the following pages financial health checklist financial institutions 1 is leverage assets to equity less than 15 times 2 is the common equity tier 1 cet1 ratio above 10 3 does the institution have a strong texas ratio 4 is non performing loan exposure less than 2 5 have net charge

this check evaluates if the company has acceptable levels of leverage leverage refers to the amount of assets held in a business when compared to the company s own resources shareholders equity when assets are 15 times equity or higher the leverage is considered excessive that means if just 6 7 1 15 of a bank s loans aren t repaid those losses will destroy 100 of the bank s equity remember that an institution s equity capital is a cushion against downturns in the business cycle i e against bad loans that result in charge offs how to assess it if total assets are less than 15x shareholders equity the stock is scored one point financial institutions 2 is the common equity tier 1 cet1 ratio above 10 why does it matter this check gauges the institution s financial strength its ability to absorb unexpected losses or remain liquid in the event of a crisis it is a measure of common equity tier 1 capital high quality equity as a percentage of risk weighted assets cet1 capital is considered the most loss absorbing form of a financial institution s capital as it can be readily converted into cash to cover any exposures in the event of a wind up how to assess it if the cet1 ratio is higher than 10 it is considered low risk the stock is scored one point you can find this information in the financial institution s last quarterly report the formula for the cet1 ratio is common equity tier 1 ratio tier 1 capital preferred stock noncontrolling interests total risk adjusted assets nore the required level of 4 5 is mandated under basel iii which is an internationally agreed upon set of measures created by the basel committee on banking supervision to ensure stability in the global banking sector this requirement was developed in response to the financial crisis of 2007 08 financial institutions 3 does the institution have a strong texas ratio why does it matter this check gauges the riskiness of a financial institution s loan portfolio by the so called texas ratio when the economy is strong this ratio is typically low when the economy falls into recession texas ratios typically rise a ratio of more than 100 is sign that the risk of failure is very high and between 50 and 100 the institution is considered vulnerable nore the reason it is known as the texas ratio is because it became prominent during the 1980s when more than 800 texas banks failed the bank analyst who came up with this ratio first applied it to texas banks generally speaking texas banks overextended credit and low ered lending standards to booming energy and real estate sectors how to assess it if the texas ratio is below 50 or below 100 and has been decreasing over the last year the stock is scored one point you can find this information in the financial institution s last

than 2 why does it matter this check indicates high overall quality of the institution s loan stock that the institution has sound underwriting practices in contrast high non performing loans npls indicates that the institution s credit department is rather lax in granting loans not checking the cred ibility of the borrower properly an institution with high npls tends to do well when the economy is doing well however it suffers when the economy goes south as borrowers who could afford the loans in better times suddenly start defaulting on their payments how to assess it if the npl ratio is less than 2 the stock is scored one point you can find this information in the financial institution s last quarterly report non performing loan npl ratio is calculated as non performing loan

portfolio in relation to its peers over time the net charge off nco ratio shows the amount of debt that an institution believes that it will never get back when compared to the av erage receivables this typically happens when a borrower goes six months without making a payment obviously the lower the nco rate the better but it s important to view this number in the context of the current credit cycle credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic stress so you want to view nco rates across institutions to see where a financial insti tution falls in relation to its peers over time

financial institution s annual and quarterly reports net charge off nco ratio is calculated as net charge off nco ratio net charge offs total loans financial institutions 6 has deposit growth stagnated or declined over the past three years why does it matter this check indicates potential funding difficulties as the institution will have less money to lend if deposit growth has stagnated or if its deposits are shrinking after all deposits are the raw material that an institution uses to make its finished goods interest income to meet the credit needs of their customers the bank has to supplement traditional funding sources with potentially less stable and more expensive funding instruments in addition the banks may take other significant steps including cutting back on their holdings of cash and selling parts of their loan portfolio all steps that will increase the challenges in maintaining a sound and profitable operation how to assess it if the deposits last year are less than 1x deposits from three years ago this check is flagged you can find this information in the financial institution s annual and quarterly reports this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for financials and is included as additional information to assist with invest ment decision making earnings quality analysis is the quality of the company s earnings high arnings quality is about avoiding companies with aggressive accounting standards as it is a symptom of poor management the quality of earnings refers to the amount of earnings attributable to higher sales or lower costs rather than artificial profits created by accounting anomalies or tricks such as inflation of inventories or changing depreciation or inventory methodology in other words you would do well to examine the accounting carefully and heed early warning signs the principal concern is whether the earnings have been overstated in financial statements earnings growth due to accrual growth is not sustainable and that s why careful assessment of earnings quality is critical and not simply taking financial statements at their face value accruals are revenues and expenses that are incurred during an accounting period for which no invoices or payments were received or made as the saying goes revenue is vanity profit sanity cash is reality the chief lesson is that cash is king asan investor you should live by the notion that management is guilty until proven innocent if there are any inconsistencies between the balance sheet income statement and cash flow statements particularly when there is a downturn in the economy and managers feel the pressure to meet earning expectations or debt covenants or to maintain or increase their personal wealth what does inventory to sales mean inventory to sales is an efficiency ratio that is used to determine the rate at which the company is liquidating its inventory it measures the amount of inventory a company is carrying compared to the number of sales orders being fulfilled a high ratio indicates a high level of inventory and consequently a less efficient inventory performance if the ratio rises it indicates either that sales are falling or that the company is keeping too much inventory in stock all of which are generally a negative sign at the same time if the inventory starts to build up the costs to store and manage it will eat into the company s profits inventory to sales ratio is calculated as inventory to sales ratio average inventory net sales where average inventory beginning inventory ending inventory 2 nore we use the annual average inventory as it takes out any seasonality effects while calculating the ratio what does accounts receivables to sales mean the accounts receivables ar to sales is a business liquidity ratio that measures how much of a company s sales occur on credit unpaid sales when a company has a larger percentage of its sales happening on a credit basis it may run into short term liquidity problems during difficult economic times and slow sales cycles a high ar to sales ratio means a significant amount of cash is tied up with the slow paying customers a low ar to sales ratio means that the business is generating fairly large cash flows from its operations and thus relies less on its investing and financing activities for liquidity accounts receivables to sales ratio is calculated as accounts receivables to sales accounts receivable sales where accounts receivable sales that have occurred on credit meaning that the company has not yet collected the cash proceeds from these sales found in the current assets section of the balance sheet sales all sales that the company has realized over the given accounting period including sales on credit and cash sales found on the in come

does the company manage its inventory well why does it matter this check is used to identify the trend in inventories which companies need to control tightly when there is a sudden and significant increase inventory to sales ratio the company might be inflating the value of inventory however it could also mean that the company has failed to charge the cost of sales on some sales or is overproducing or is selling off its stocks as inventory may be obsolete and no longer in demand any of which would be negative it often indicates too that the company is facing larger financial problems how to assess it if the last four quarters inventory to sales ratio is less than 1 1x the ratio in previous four quarters the stock is scored one point you can find this information in the balance sheet and income statement by the company s last eight quarterly reports 2 does the company manage its credit sales well why does it matter this check indicates whether a company collects its credit sales competently if accounts receivable gets significantly out of line with sales it indicates clearly that the company is struggling to collect payments from customers and that the company might be inflating the value of receivables potential issues may be recording revenue too soon or increased competition forcing the company to extend better credit terms to customers it s key to determine whether this is just a short term or cyclical abnormality or if there is a fundamental problem how to assess it if the last four quarters accounts receivable to sales ratio is less than 1 1x the ratio in previous four quarters the stock is scored one point you can find this information in the balance sheet and income statement by the company s last eight quarterly reports 3 are one time adjustments to earnings rare why does it matter this check indicates whether the company uses one time adjustments to net profits infrequently a multi year pattern of significant one time adjustments is a cause for concern that a company may be distorting its earnings performance to meet forecasts and that investors should question whether the underlying numbers have any value after all a one time item as the term implies is supposed to be just that a rare infrequent event how to assess it if the one time charges percentage of sales averaged less than 3 over the past five years the stock is scored one point nore every time a company reports a one time item you should make sure that it is truly a one off and that it is material enough that excluding it makes sense as long as the item is indeed only a one off it may not lead to the company gaining the reputation of being a se rial adjustor 4 does cash flow from operations exceed net profit regularly why does it matter this check is used to verify that the company is making not just accounting profits but cash profits if cash flow from operations cfo is consistently less than net profit it might be a signal of heavy use of accrual accounting in general cfo should be higher than reported net profits as depreciation and amortisation are added back to net profit in the cash flow statement but if a company is growing very quickly or investing substantially in working capital cash earnings are often less than accounting earnings the bottom line when companies report profits but bleed cash believe the cash ultimately if cash is not being generated the earnings are artificial how to assess it if cash flow from operations to net profit is greater than 1 for at least three of the past five years the stock is scored one point 5 has the company consistently generated free cash flow over the past five years why does it matter this check indicates whether the company s free cash flow fcf is positive or negative the latter means the company consumes more cash than it is taking in which would require it to raise money by borrowing or offering additional new shares all the same time negative fcf could also be a sign that a company is making significant investments if these investments earn high re turns the strategy has the potential to add value in the long run how to assess it if fcf is positive in each of the past five years the stock is scored one point 6 was last year s income tax rate significantly lower than the statutory rate why does it matter this check indicates whether the earnings reported last year were potentially inflated by a lower level of income tax than the statutory corporate rate this could be due to temporary deductibles like loss carry forwards and or tax benefits of interest deduction note that this can be entirely legitimate for some companies because of conditions particular to them and or their industry such as subsi dies tax incentives and tax breaks how to assess it if the company s last year s annual income tax rate was less than 0 80x the statutory corporate tax rate this check is flagged this factor has a zero weight impact on the scoring model for financials and is included as additional information to assist with invest ment decision making bringing it all together time favours quality investing na world where short termism is encouraged by the power of algorithms and fuelled by thrill of rapid change short term perfor mance can become an obsession and the longer outlook neglected identifying companies able to shrug off short termism and gravity of financial theory means investing in quality stocks which are more likely to stand the test of time over the long term quality stocks tend to offer fewer negative surprises and as a result experience smaller falls than the overall market accordingly invest ing in quality companies helps avoid the unnecessary frustrations associated with recovering from steep losses but the real potential reward for investing in them is that high quality companies continue growing over time by consistently reinvesting a large part of their earnings at high rates of return this compounds the value of your stake in the business over many years achieving exponential growth that s why great businesses are often referred to as compounders a business compounding power can be analysed across three key dimensions the percentage of earnings that can be reinvested back into the business the return on reinvested capital that the business can achieve how excess cash flow not reinvested in the business is used for example if a business can achieve 20 incremental returns on capital and reinvest 50 of its earnings each year its intrinsic value will compound by 10 annually 20 x 50 if it can buy back its shares at cheap levels or make value accretive acquisitions with the other 50 the compounding will be even stronger the bottom line is that with time on your side you don t have to go for home runs to invest successfully you will do better paying fair value for a high quality company and sticking with it timing is far less important the rolling snowball effect of compounding explains why the risks of permanently losing capital are low even if in hindsight you end up overpaying for great businesses for a deeper explana tion see bringing valuation into the equation another great and more obvious advantage in buying high quality stocks is low portfolio turnover you allow the money you would have had to pay in capital gains taxes to continue compounding on your behalf you also reduce transaction costs such as trading commission and slippage while accruing dividends that you might otherwise miss by moving in and out of the market too quickly only buying stocks for less than they are worth means that you are just speculating on an increase in its stock price which have little to do with the underlying fundamentals stocks owned primarily because of price tend to be investments in poor quality companies these requires constant focus on timing as they have to be sold fairly quickly this is because any gap between price and value when you bought the stock slowly erodes over time as fair value declines due to the poor quality of the business this leads to a second problem with making investments primarily on the basis that the stock is cheap once it is fairly priced and sold you need to find a new opportunity including doing all the necessary due diligence asa result you can t keep using all of your previous research on an investment even though the most valuable information usually has a long timeframe for which it is relevant quality of the business model potential growth opportunities industry structure management team track record etc having to constantly generate new ideas by finding and analysing a lot of new information each time is a signifi cant downside on top of that an investment approach that requires a lot of decision making is more error prone bringing valuation into the equation having confidence in the long term earnings trajectory of a business is one of the strongest edges you can have as an investor if you are right about the sustainability of a high quality company s growth and profitability you are probably buying the business at a very low multiple of future earnings this because you get both compounding from earnings growth and the reward of multiple expansion that typically follows a history of consistent earnings growth earnings expectations for a business don t tend to vary significantly one year out but opinions about the multiple that it deserves do these are often focused on a belief that reversion to the mean is imminent without considering the business and company differences it follows that forecasting current year earnings is key for investors with a short term focus however when looking further out a company s valuation multiple is increasingly dependent on its longer term earnings power and predictability as a result differences in earnings expectations and valuation multiples become more pronounced as market participants varying assumptions compound over the long term because of this current valuation multiples should not be a major concern if deep fundamental research supports sustainability of growth if you are a long term investor your margin of safety has more to do with your confidence that a company s competitive advan tages will stay strong or get stronger rather than some estimate of a discount to its fair value the important lesson to learn is that it s bet ter to make a mistake on the purchase price of a business than the quality of a business as quality drives stock prices in the long run using the illustrative table below as an example if you pay 20x earnings for a 20 compounder in year 0 the corresponding margin of safety on your assumed exit multiple in year 10 is materially higher given the 3 2x effective forward p e multiple on your investment consequently you should pay up for high quality companies that are able to maintain earnings growth year after year when you are a long term investor in great businesses what seems expensive on near term multiples is often cheap in the long run the fact is that despite having almost never appeared fairly valued amazon and netflix are two of the best performing stocks of the past decade as the

20 x 6 19 1 12 without considering multiple expansion at that price the future total return of the company would be equal to the market return over the subse quent 10 years in other words when you overpay for quality the period until the stock generates excess returns is prolonged as it will take a few years for the business to catch up with the stock peter lynch once explained this time is on your side when you own shares of superior companies patience pays off in investing atience is a necessity when investing in great companies and the secret to making your money grow all too often impatience costs investors dearly because they can t fight their emotions many end up buying at the tail end of a market rally or selling ina panic at a loss however you must have patience to ride through the inevitable downswings to wait for great investments to play out and let the power of compounding do its work likewise you have to have patience to wait for the right opportunity to buy at a price well below its fair value estimate great companies are rarely available at cheap valuations but once in a while you will be able to buy them at reasonable prices especially during an eco nomic downturn or a temporary setback in 1973 warren buffet invested more than us 10 million in the washington post company by the end of 1974 the share price had dropped nearly 25 and it took three years to recover fully instead of selling his stake while the price was falling buffet went against the herd and continued buying he knew that the fundamentals of the business were strong and that the stock was cheap over time the share price bounced back and the business grew and so did the underlying business value because of stock repurchases per share business value increased considerably faster today buffett regards his investment in the washington post as one of his best and most profitable ever maintaining a multi year view by focusing your thoughts on the long term fundamentals and not expecting instant returns is probably the most important aspect of avoiding short term noise if buffett had sold his washington post shares when the price fell he would have lost money and missed out on the potential for future returns that s why he is fond of saying that the stock market is a device for trans ferring money from the impatient to the patient the important lesson is that if you have done your homework well in investing in a high quality business be patient and wait remains the best stance in your pursuit of wealth creation from stocks the bottom line is that patience is the most essential investor quality but also one of the hardest things to learn as the legendary trader jesse livermore once said that is why so many men in wall street who are not at all in the sucker class not even in the third grade nev ertheless lose money the market does not beat them they beat themselves because though they have brains they cannot sit still the rationality of holding cash remember it s typically better to stay on the sidelines and wait for better opportunities than to commit to owning stocks priced for sub par returns it s critical to resist the pull of action that satisfies the itch to do something after all to most of us activity equals achieve ment likewise in a bull market we all hate the feeling of missing out on the party and avoid cash in favour of stocks but then as charlie munger says it takes character to sit there with all that cash and do nothing i didn t get to where i am by going after mediocre opportuni ties munger would go years building up huge cash reserves until he felt he had found something low risk and highly intelligent the bottom line is that keeping cash on hand facilitates an investor s success even if it feels wrong to be sitting on it and earning nothing for long periods holding cash is a cheap hedge as its value rise as the market plunges and in addition to downside protection cash also provides peace of mind over large unexpected costs or redemption requests by fund investors it will certainly reduce the risk of panic driven selling when markets get volatile but most importantly always having cash available to invest enables you to take advantage of opportunities that ma present themselves in the future without first needing to sell other stocks which would have likely become cheap themselves in a sell off the downside of course is losing purchasing power over time due to inflation and the risk of being underinvested in a rapidly rising market acommon sense strategy may be to allocate at least 5 of your portfolio to cash in a prevailing bull market though many prudent money managers may prefer to keep between 10 and 20 in cash on average it s all about how much volatility you can stomach everyone s temperament is different so if investments are keeping you awake at night it is important to reduce the percentage invested down to your sleep level particularly when investing opportunities are scarce 250 200 150

traded on nasdaq stockholm exchange for the 2010 20 period with 2020 being an outlier year due to the covid 19 pandemic see chart above clearly the average business s underlying value doesn t fluctuate this much over a year moreover the stock market loses 10 of its overall value about once per year on average so the patient investor usually doesn t have to wait more than a year or two for an attractive entry point due to the volatility of the marketplace in the meantime building a watchlist of great companies to own at the right price is time well spent this quote from warren buffett is well worth remembering and serves as a fitting conclusion to this section cash is like oxygen when you don t need it you don t notice it when you do needit it s the only thing you need the beauty of compounding albert einstein famously referred to compound interest that is the return on incremental capital as the eighth wonder of the world he also called it mankind s greatest invention because it allows for the reliable systematic accumulation of wealth although its power is relatively invisible over short periods of time it is enormous over the long term keep in mind that more than 97 of warren buffett s net worth came after his 65 birthday as noted much of the secret to successful investing is the compounding of returns over time as the table compound interest below illustrates

exponential effect of compounding which explains why the latter is often underestimated after all un derstanding that a great company s stock can multiply 100 times in 25 years when you compound at 20 annually is simple but not in tuitive however if you sell in year 20 you will get only about 40 times and if you hold it for just 10 years your return is five times your original investment but patiently sitting through these years earning an annual return of 20 is anything but easy along the way there are bumps in the road plenty of naysayers and inevitable downswings it takes a lot of conviction not to sell during those stressful times thomas phelps provided a table in his truly fascinating book 100 to 1 in the stock market that shows annual returns and how many years it would take before you achieve a 100 bagger time needed to return 100x annualised return cagr years to 100 bagger 14 35 years 16 6 30 years 20 25 years 26 20 years 36 15 years source 100 to 1 in the stock market thomas phelps 1972 auseful tool for assessing the impact of compound interest and the doubling effect is the rule of 72 the rule says that if you divide an interest rate into 72 it will tell you how many years it will take to double your investment at 24 interest a buck would double in 3 years 72 24 3 the ugly side of compounding just as compounding geometrically increases the value of positive returns it also exacerbates the impact of negative returns the bottom line is that it s very difficult to recover from a large loss or make up for negative compounding years to get you back to even as rewards and penalties for compounding are asymmetrical what you should be aiming to accomplish is avoiding big mistakes winning big in the stock market is all about losing the least amount possible when you re wrong not being right all the time remember a seasoned investor who earns 20 for two consecutive years comes out ahead of a newbie investor who earns 100 in a bull year and loses 30 or more in the following year there is an old saying there are old pilots and there are bold pilots but there aren t many old bold pilots the point is that you should always try to put yourself in a position where the likelihood of a big drop is extremely limited as explained before staying power counts in the investment world the ability to stick around for a long time should be the cornerstone of any investment strategy that s why you should avoid leverage borrowed money by using a cash only account at your brokerage firm leverage just magnifies outcomes not adding value never forget that any stock you buy or your whole portfolio can go down 50 or more on the whims of the market leverage could literally destroy in a moment the benefit of many years of investment success by margin calls and forced sales from your brokerage firm also you should seek to avoid overly leveraged investments and lottery tickets the get rich quick stocks or at least ensure that these make up no more than a small portion of your portfolio in other words keep your mistakes small enough so you can survive them the up side takes care of itself the following table illustrates the asymmetrical impact of compounding the more you lose the harder it is to get back to even loss recovery percent loss of position return needed to break even 10 11 20 25 30 43 40 67 50 100 60 150 70 233 80 400 90 900 source redeye equity research however interrupting the compounding clock can occur in many ways another common mistake is abandoning an investment strategy that has worked reasonably well over the long term but recently had a few bad years moving on when things get tough to the hot new thing is likely to leave you worse off still this investment failure is common as most investors have a year end focus it is intuitive to feel that the pursuit of the best retums at all times is the best way to maximise wealth nonetheless maximising annual returns in a given year and maximising long term wealth are two different things if the average investor is trying to win in the next year and you trying to win over the next five years you both have potential to win but you are ultimately going to outperform by resisting the urge to swing for the fences successful investing is not about beating the market every time it s about beating the market over time short holding periods and the desire for quick gains are rather hallmarks of specula tion in other words stock market investing is a long term game that is best played over your entire lifetime the mistake of selling too early as charlie munger says the first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily the mistakes that will impact your perfor mance most when investing in compounders are likely to be decisions to sell too soon one of the most powerful concepts in portfolio management is to let your winners run being a long term investor can be relatively easy during a bull market however when the stock market gets extremely volatile your resilience will be tested after all investing is an existential act you are what you do not what you think the bottom line is that you can borrow ideas but you can t borrow confidence or conviction you will never hold the compounders long enough to achieve stellar returns if you don t understand what you own why you own it and its value you need deep industry expertise past work or recent analysis current work and the correct mindset to withstand the pain of extreme paper losses crisis conditions and headlines in the financial press often erode investors patience leading them to sell out of fear and lack of knowledge keep in mind that this is the key reason for doing deep fundamental research to forge the courage to hold on to or buy into stocks after they have detached from reality on the downside building real depth of knowledge about the company behind the stock is what makes part time investing so difficult and why most retail investors struggle with stock selection however this is also the case for many professional money managers who have too many stocks in their portfolios very few have time to do deep dives on more than 20 companies let alone maintain a superior understanding of all those portfolio holdings nonetheless above average investing is nearly impossible if you don t do the deep fundamental work to invest with high confidence and conviction having more than 20 positions in your portfolio typically makes you more of a tourist than an owner in most of your positions an owner s mindset is key to reap the benefits of compounding keep in mind the quote from the oil baron paul getty to succeed in business to reach the top an individual must know all it is possible to know about that business selling compounders prematurely can be a life altering mistake typically a few top performing investments will contribute the vast majority of your returns in fact it s a common theme among the world s greatest investors that a few winners have carried their entire portfolio for example charlie munger acknowledges having made almost all his money from a few big winners the same is true for ben jamin graham peter lynch philip fisher warren buffett and many other great investors typically they have held these winners for more than a decade often 20 years or more the only time you should consider selling a compounder is when it stops being a great business the position becomes too large in your portfolio if the company becomes wildly overpriced or cash is needed to take advantage of a superior opportunity otherwise there is no need to reap the gains in compounders as these are companies that increase steadily in value stocks to buy low and let grow finally only a handful of your positions need to be winners if you own enough compounders it is easy to forget but this is an asymmetric game you can only lose 1x your investment but some picks can return 10x or even 100x if you have the confidence and conviction to hold long enough although these numbers may seem unfeasible they are achievable as thomas phelps writes in 100 to 1 in the stock market a great many people i am sure have never set out to increase their capital one hundredfold because they had no idea that it could be done iam sure this is still true today as it was back in 1972 when the book was first published moreover finding one of these 100 baggers might save your whole investment career the redeye top picks portfolio op picks is a paper trading portfolio long only unhedged that redeye offers to private investors who want to learn about invest ing the portfolio is based on redeye s coverage universe of listed nordic stocks and leverages redeye s core skills of fundamental research and analysis accordingly we only invest in companies and industries that we already know and understand deeply after all true investment risk lies in not knowing what you are doing the portfolio s investment approach is highly opportunistic and focused on smaller less followed growth stocks in the quest for tomor row s multibaggers stocks that have prospects for gains of up to 2x and more this is partly because the small cap space is where an information edge is more likely to be obtained but the primary advantage of investing in small cap stocks is that size is the first and fore most differentiator of a multibagger investing approach it is best summarised by christopher mayer in his book 100 baggers start with acorns wind up with oak trees start with oak trees and you won t have quite the same dramatic growth we try to identify companies supported by thematic long term trends particularly niche market leaders with proven management anda compounding growth outlook but although we prefer to take a long term view we are always ready to act opportunistically if we believe the odds are stacked heavily in our favour we will come back to this in stocks fall into three buckets the goal of the disciplined repeatable investment process is to construct a portfolio of companies with immediate growth potential and the strong likelihood of long term profitability by the following characteristics 1 high quality business 2 sufficiently undervalued and 3 the market is about to recognize the full potential of the business these elements are all different ways to reduce the risk in the stocks we invest in to provide room for bad luck and mistakes below they are described in more detail 1 quality our quality scorecard for companies swings the investment decisions a company with overall top level scores of 5 in each category people business financials is typically capable of withstanding the tests of time and adversity these companies have the potential to improve with time and may be able to generate significant compounding wealth for the long term owner conversely no matter the numbers we refuse to invest in any company that has a people score below 4 as we believe the peo ple behind the company to be the most important thing 2 valuation we believe well bought is half sold which is why we look for businesses that are sufficiently undervalued to warrant an investment warren buffett summarised the point best never count on making a good sale have the purchase price be so attractive that even a mediocre sale gives good results the appropriate margin of safety is not static it may differ across each business that we own based on our degree of uncer tainty over its value which is a function of the quality of the business 3 timeliness we believe that cheap alone is not a reason to invest as this can lead to value traps we seek to identify a spe cific path that will allow a company to achieve its full potential in a timely manner namely catalysts catalysts are ongoing or potential corporate events or a series of events that accelerate value realisation situations where price and liquidity are likely to increase they include mergers tender offers spin offs litigations regulatory changes rights offerings buybacks activist investor campaigns and many others ideally in anticipation of a positive catalyst we want to see sentiment around the stock improving as stock prices reflect expectations for future financial performance we always review the stock chart as it will tell us at a glance if we are early on the stock or not also the price trend informs us about market sentiment towards the stock which is critical to understand ing why it may be cheap typically we see a surge in volume and then in price as we get closer to the catalyst s realisation this would indicate that in vestors might be accumulating shares in anticipation of the catalyst playing out however a crowded name that has already outperformed based on the expectation of a positive catalyst is likely to get a limited reaction if and when the catalyst does occur track record of proven results our goal with top picks is to compound wealth at a superior rate over the long term while minimising the risk of permanent losses of capital we are not trying to be right all the time but to increase the odds of being right the hit ratio most importantly we try to make much more money when we are right than we lose when we are wrong the win loss ratio
